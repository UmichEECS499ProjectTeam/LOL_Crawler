Skill
usage
Sometimes
it
can
benefit
Karthus
to
die
a
strategic
death,
by
rushing
into
a
group
of
enemies
and
casting
Defile
the
enemy
will
focus
you
long
enough
for
your
team
to
initiate
without
affecting
your
chance
of
winning
a
team
fight,
as
Karthus
can
cast
his
spells
even
after
dying.
You
can
also
activate
Zhonya's
Hourglass
right
before
dying
to
let
Defile
tick
even
longer.
His
passive
allows
him
to
cast
spells
while
dead.
Abuse
this
every
time
you
die
and
punish
any
who
remain
near
your
corpse,
casting
Wall
of
Pain
if
not
already
used
and
endlessly
casting
Lay
Waste
.
This
may
actually
get
you
a
kill.
When
focusing
on
harassment
,
try
placing
Lay
Waste
where
it
will
hit
the
champion,
but
not
the
minions.
This
way,
it
will
deal
double
damage.
Karthus
is
a
great
harasser.
Use
your
Lay
Waste
to
zone
your
enemies.
Lay
Waste
can
be
used
to
scout
brushes
since
it
reveals
a
small
area
around
where
it
is
cast.
Since
the
skill
has
a
low
base
cost,
this
can
be
used
to
scout
brushes
frequently.
Lay
Waste
is
very
strong
at
farming
minions
and
harassing
enemy
champions.
Taking
1
level
of
Wall
of
Pain
gives
you
a
slow
allowing
you
more
time
to
cast
Defile
on
fleeing
enemies,
as
well
as
deterring
attempts
of
harassment,
even
at
their
towers.
In
later
game
it
is
useful
in
team
fights,
thanks
to
its
magic
resistance
debuffs.
With
this
spell,
Karthus
can
actually
be
a
very
good
ganker,
as
it
slows
and
allows
his
teammates
to
deal
more
damage.
Karthus's
Defile
at
higher
levels
can
mow
down
creeps
by
standing
next
to
them
or
walking
past
them
for
just
2
seconds.
If
given
free
rein
or
adequate
protection
from
enemy
champions,
this
can
turn
the
tide
of
a
battle
very
quickly
or
cement
a
teams
victory.
Ask
your
allies
to
help
point
out
when
you
should
use
Requiem
to
get
kills
in
different
lanes,
or
alternatively,
alert
your
teammates
when
you
are
about
to
use
it.
However,
be
sure
to
keep
your
eye
out
for
action
elsewhere
on
the
map;
you
may
be
able
to
help
someone
when
they
otherwise
wouldn't
have
time
to
type
for
help.
Before
using
Requiem
to
kill
a
retreating
enemy,
consider
the
shield/heal/defensive
abilities
and
items
of
the
enemy
team;
at
endgame,
it
is
usually
more
important
to
have
an
ultimate
up
than
to
force
enemies
to
heal.
During
laning,
it
may
be
more
beneficial
to
attack
the
caster
minions
in
the
back
and
to
kill
them
than
to
harass
an
opponent.
If
you
find
yourself
being
outlaned
by
the
enemy,
pushing
them
back
and
stacking
up
on
your
own
minions
can
help
control
them
and
keep
them
away
from
your
tower.
If
your
team
can
effectively
distract
the
enemy,
Karthus
can
actually
be
a
very
effective
pusher,
as
the
sheer
speed
at
which
he
can
consistently
clear
minion
waves
allows
him
to
push
his
team's
minions
to
a
tower
and
destroy
it
in
a
short
amount
of
time.
Karthus
highly
benefits
from
the
Crest
of
the
Ancient
Golem
buff,
giving
him
increased
mana
regeneration
and
reduced
cooldowns
for
all
his
spells,
allowing
a
focused
AP
build.
Requiem
can
be
used
mid-game
before
a
major
offensive
is
launched
to
weaken
all
enemies,
making
them
easier
to
kill.
Flash
and
Ghost
are
useful
summoner
spells,
as
Karthus
often
needs
mobility
in
order
to
be
an
asset
to
the
team.
It
is
possible
to
jungle
using
Karthus
with
the
proper
runes
and/or
masteries.
To
get
the
blue
golem
rune,
use
Lay
Waste
only
on
the
blue
golem
(missing
the
smaller
monsters).
This
way,
you
will
deal
double
damage
to
only
the
golem.
Be
careful
of
when
to
use
Requiem
due
to
your
ability
power
and
the
enemies
magic
resistance.
Both
Wall
of
Pain's
slow
and
stat
reduction
go
through
Banshee's
Veil
.
Wall
of
Pain
can
be
a
viable
tool
to
saving
an
ally
champion's
life
due
to
its
movement
speed
reduction.
Use
it
to
give
your
allies
a
chance
to
get
away
if
they
are
running
from
a
pursuing
champion.
Notice
that
Karthus
is
very
good
at
medium
range,
however
he
is
easily
countered
by
champions
who
can
attack
him
from
a
very
long
range
like,
for
example,
Lux
.
Casting
Requiem
while
actually
alive
is
generally
a
bad
idea,
unless
you
are
well
away
from
any
enemy
champions
or
they
are
on
the
retreat
from
your
team.
You
will
become
the
focus
of
enemy
champions
during
the
lengthy
channel,
and
if
you
die
or
are
disabled
during
it,
the
ability
is
cancelled
and
goes
on
cooldown
.
If
you
die
before
using
Requiem
,
however,
you
can
still
use
it
during
Death
Defied
and
your
opponents
will
be
unable
to
stop
you
in
any
way.
Karthus
can
possibly
proxy
if
you
build
all
mana
due
to
his
Lay
Waste
Dominion
and
Twisted
Treeline
Karthus
is
very
good
at
interrupting
captures
via
Karthus's
Defile
and
Lay
Waste
.
On
Dominion,
Karthus
can
work
as
a
potent
defender
in
bottom
lane
(between
the
Boneyard
and
Quarry),
thanks
to
his
potent
zoning,
ability
to
easily
defend
his
point
until
reinforcements
can
arrive
via
his
passive,
damage
aura
via
Karthus's
Defile
,
and
Lay
Waste
poke,
and
abilty
to
have
a
global
presence
via
Requiem
.
However,
he
is
very
vulnerable
to
ganks
if
overextended.
If
you're
taking
Karthus
as
a
top
laner
on
Dominion
(between
the
Drill
and
Refinery),
Wall
of
Pain
can
prove
quite
useful
as
an
initiation
tool
for
turret
teamfights
(especially
at
the
Windmill),
as
it
increases
the
damage
all
your
allies
deal
while
slowing
the
enemy.
(If
placed
right,
it
can
even
reveal
their
brush!)
By
taking
levels
at
3,
4,
10,
and
the
remaining
two
between
levels
11-18,
you
can
become
frightfully
efficient
at
helping
your
allies
cap
points.
As
such,
taking
Garrison
to
further
improve
your
initiation
can
prove
valuable.
Build
usage
Due
to
Requiem
,
the
enemy
team
will
likely
build
some
magic
resistance.
Building
magic
penetration
items
such
as
Void
Staff
will
help
pass
through
their
defenses.
Will
of
the
Ancients
can
enable
you
to
regain
health
quickly
with
Defile
or
Requiem
,
especially
with
enemy
minions
around.
Lay
Waste
also
gains
full
spell
vamp
when
only
used
to
attack
a
single
enemy.
When
played
as
more
tanky
build,
consider
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
as
a
top-priority
item.
Its
passive
provides
slow
for
all
your
spells,
but
especially
for
Lay
Waste
,
which
you
can
use
to
kite
enemy
with
terrifying
effeciency.
On
either
lane
for
Dominion,
Requiem
has
a
great
deal
of
utility.
Not
only
can
it
be
used
to
secure
kills,
but
it
can
also
slow
via
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
,
butter
up
enemies
for
your
teammates
from
afar,
or
simply
work
as
a
global
capture
interrupter.
Try
building
tanky
on
Karthus
as
you
will
try
to
stay
in
the
teamfight
with
your
Defile
on
and
spam
Lay
Waste
.
Building
an
Archangel's
Staff
is
a
strong
choice
for
Karthus
as
Lay
Waste
can
quickly
build
up
the
Archangel's
staff's
passive.
Void
Staff
has
nice
synergy
with
Wall
of
Pain
.
You
can
lower
the
target's
magic
resistance
by
15%
and
ignoring
35%
of
it,
ending
up
in
50%
when
combined.
Since
the
Wall
of
Pain
now
provides
percentual
magic
resistance
reduction,
it
can
no
longer
decrease
it
below
zero.
Flat
reduction
from
Abyssal
Scepter
has
less
synergy,
but
it
can
still
be
useful
against
champs
with
lower
magic
resistance
.
As
mentioned
previously,
Karthus
can
be
played
as
suicide
initiator.
Build
him
fully
offensive
with
items
such
as
Rabadon's
Deathcap
and
Void
Staff
to
maximize
your
damage
output.
Mejai's
Soulstealer
can
be
viable
even
in
this
build.
You
can
kill
and
assist
easily
with
Death
Defied
,
being
able
to
maintain
more
stacks
even
with
your
death.

Countering
Playing
against
Karthus
can
be
extremely
frustrating,
as
avoiding
death
with
a
small
amount
of
health
left
is
nearly
impossible
due
his
Requiem
.
If
you
find
yourself
having
trouble
with
an
enemy
Karthus
,
buying
a
Banshee's
Veil
can
offer
at
least
some
protection
to
his
ultimate.
If
you
are
a
caster
and
wish
different/more
protection,
grabbing
a
Zhonya's
Hourglass
earlier
than
you
normally
would
can
save
you
on
many
occasions.
If
you
are
an
AD
-based
champion
and
wish
for
some
additional
protection,
a
Hexdrinker
or
Maw
of
Malmortius
can
block
250
or
400
magic
damage
respectively
from
his
ultimate
if
he
takes
you
below
30%
health.
Beware
however,
those
items
aren't
as
reliable
as
Zhonya's
Hourglass
.
Elixir
of
Fortitude
is
a
good
counter
to
Karthus's
ultimate
during
the
early
and
mid
game.
It
costs
only
a
fraction
of
the
other
items
which
would
normally
be
used
to
counter
Requiem
.
Always
remember,
especially
during
team
fights,
that
Karthus
can
continue
to
cast
spells
while
he's
dead
without
the
cost
of
mana.
When
engaging
his
team,
kill
Karthus
first,
then
retreat
out
of
his
attack
area
before
continuing
the
fight.
When
in
the
midst
of
a
team
fight,
it
may
be
difficult
to
notice
the
attack
animation
of
his
Lay
Waste
.
Be
wary
of
this
if
you
are
playing
a
squishy
character
and/or
have
little
magic
resistance,
as
Karthus'
damage
output
is
steady
and
deadly.
Also,
do
not
underestimate
the
tick
on
his
Defile
.
It
is
DoT
,
so
it
may
not
be
noticeable
at
first,
but
its
damage
can
be
as
much
as
160
per
second,
not
counting
resistances,
on
top
of
his
damage
from
Lay
Waste
.
Do
not
underestimate
Karthus'
1v1
potential.
He
may
be
squishy,
but
his
killing
power
vastly
increases
when
fighting
stationary,
single
targets.
If
you
engage
him
as
ranged,
try
to
stay
out
of
his
Defile
and
keep
moving
to
avoid
his
Lay
Waste
.
If
you
need
to
remain
stationary,
stay
near
other
targets
that
will
be
damaged
by
his
Lay
Waste
(e.g.:
Allied
minions
or
neutral
monsters)
to
reduce
his
damage
output.
If
you
engage
him
as
melee,
you
should
either
only
do
so
if
you
have
the
level
advantage
or
survivability
to
engage
him
in
his
AoE
spells
and
live.
Karthus's
Wall
of
Pain
reduces
magic
resistance
,
instead
of
penetrating
it.
This
means
that
damage
done
to
you
by
all
enemies
will
be
increased.
Keep
this
in
mind
while
standing
in
or
walking
through
his
Wall
of
Pain
during
a
team
fight.
Some
Karthus
players
will
intentionally
walk
into
a
teamfight
and
die,
This
is
rather
a
great
strategy
if
Karthus
is
in
a
situation
where
he
will
die
because
he
can
cast
his
spells
for
7
seconds
after
his
death.
Make
sure
that
after
you
kill
him,
stay
away
from
his
Defile
.
Do
not
ignore
Karthus
upon
killing
him.
Due
to
his
passive,
he
can
cast
any
and
all
spells
freely,
with
the
only
restriction
being
cooldowns.
Ignoring
this
fact
and
staying
in
close
proximity
to
Karthus
before
his
passive
wears
off
can
often
lead
to
him
killing
you.
Laning
against
Karthus
can
be
challenging
if
you
are
not
aware
of
his
Lay
Waste
.
Without
at
least
one
movement
speed
increasing
item
(e.g.
Boots
of
Speed
)
walking
away
from
your
minions
can
be
costly
even
while
watching
for
Lay
Waste's
if
the
Karthus
is
predicting
your
movements
accurately.
To
avoid
the
doubled
damage,
stand
near
one
or
two
minions.
That
way,
if
Karthus
attempts
to
harass
you
with
Lay
Waste
,
he
is
either
doing
minimal
damage
to
you
and
the
minion
or
placing
it
so
that
you
have
more
time
to
respond,
as
the
AoE
is
only
half
as
close
to
you.
Standing
in
the
middle
of
your
minions
is
a
less
favorable
way
to
reduce
damage
as
the
unit
collision
can
more
or
less
hold
you
in
place
while
Karthus
can
cast
Lay
Waste
s
continually.

Trivia
Skill
usage
Sometimes
it
can
benefit
Karthus
to
die
a
strategic
death,
by
rushing
into
a
group
of
enemies
and
casting
Defile
the
enemy
will
focus
you
long
enough
for
your
team
to
initiate
without
affecting
your
chance
of
winning
a
team
fight,
as
Karthus
can
cast
his
spells
even
after
dying.
You
can
also
activate
Zhonya's
Hourglass
right
before
dying
to
let
Defile
tick
even
longer.
His
passive
allows
him
to
cast
spells
while
dead.
Abuse
this
every
time
you
die
and
punish
any
who
remain
near
your
corpse,
casting
Wall
of
Pain
if
not
already
used
and
endlessly
casting
Lay
Waste
.
This
may
actually
get
you
a
kill.
When
focusing
on
harassment
,
try
placing
Lay
Waste
where
it
will
hit
the
champion,
but
not
the
minions.
This
way,
it
will
deal
double
damage.
Karthus
is
a
great
harasser.
Use
your
Lay
Waste
to
zone
your
enemies.
Lay
Waste
can
be
used
to
scout
brushes
since
it
reveals
a
small
area
around
where
it
is
cast.
Since
the
skill
has
a
low
base
cost,
this
can
be
used
to
scout
brushes
frequently.
Lay
Waste
is
very
strong
at
farming
minions
and
harassing
enemy
champions.
Taking
1
level
of
Wall
of
Pain
gives
you
a
slow
allowing
you
more
time
to
cast
Defile
on
fleeing
enemies,
as
well
as
deterring
attempts
of
harassment,
even
at
their
towers.
In
later
game
it
is
useful
in
team
fights,
thanks
to
its
magic
resistance
debuffs.
With
this
spell,
Karthus
can
actually
be
a
very
good
ganker,
as
it
slows
and
allows
his
teammates
to
deal
more
damage.
Karthus's
Defile
at
higher
levels
can
mow
down
creeps
by
standing
next
to
them
or
walking
past
them
for
just
2
seconds.
If
given
free
rein
or
adequate
protection
from
enemy
champions,
this
can
turn
the
tide
of
a
battle
very
quickly
or
cement
a
teams
victory.
Ask
your
allies
to
help
point
out
when
you
should
use
Requiem
to
get
kills
in
different
lanes,
or
alternatively,
alert
your
teammates
when
you
are
about
to
use
it.
However,
be
sure
to
keep
your
eye
out
for
action
elsewhere
on
the
map;
you
may
be
able
to
help
someone
when
they
otherwise
wouldn't
have
time
to
type
for
help.
Before
using
Requiem
to
kill
a
retreating
enemy,
consider
the
shield/heal/defensive
abilities
and
items
of
the
enemy
team;
at
endgame,
it
is
usually
more
important
to
have
an
ultimate
up
than
to
force
enemies
to
heal.
During
laning,
it
may
be
more
beneficial
to
attack
the
caster
minions
in
the
back
and
to
kill
them
than
to
harass
an
opponent.
If
you
find
yourself
being
outlaned
by
the
enemy,
pushing
them
back
and
stacking
up
on
your
own
minions
can
help
control
them
and
keep
them
away
from
your
tower.
If
your
team
can
effectively
distract
the
enemy,
Karthus
can
actually
be
a
very
effective
pusher,
as
the
sheer
speed
at
which
he
can
consistently
clear
minion
waves
allows
him
to
push
his
team's
minions
to
a
tower
and
destroy
it
in
a
short
amount
of
time.
Karthus
highly
benefits
from
the
Crest
of
the
Ancient
Golem
buff,
giving
him
increased
mana
regeneration
and
reduced
cooldowns
for
all
his
spells,
allowing
a
focused
AP
build.
Requiem
can
be
used
mid-game
before
a
major
offensive
is
launched
to
weaken
all
enemies,
making
them
easier
to
kill.
Flash
and
Ghost
are
useful
summoner
spells,
as
Karthus
often
needs
mobility
in
order
to
be
an
asset
to
the
team.
It
is
possible
to
jungle
using
Karthus
with
the
proper
runes
and/or
masteries.
To
get
the
blue
golem
rune,
use
Lay
Waste
only
on
the
blue
golem
(missing
the
smaller
monsters).
This
way,
you
will
deal
double
damage
to
only
the
golem.
Be
careful
of
when
to
use
Requiem
due
to
your
ability
power
and
the
enemies
magic
resistance.
Both
Wall
of
Pain's
slow
and
stat
reduction
go
through
Banshee's
Veil
.
Wall
of
Pain
can
be
a
viable
tool
to
saving
an
ally
champion's
life
due
to
its
movement
speed
reduction.
Use
it
to
give
your
allies
a
chance
to
get
away
if
they
are
running
from
a
pursuing
champion.
Notice
that
Karthus
is
very
good
at
medium
range,
however
he
is
easily
countered
by
champions
who
can
attack
him
from
a
very
long
range
like,
for
example,
Lux
.
Casting
Requiem
while
actually
alive
is
generally
a
bad
idea,
unless
you
are
well
away
from
any
enemy
champions
or
they
are
on
the
retreat
from
your
team.
You
will
become
the
focus
of
enemy
champions
during
the
lengthy
channel,
and
if
you
die
or
are
disabled
during
it,
the
ability
is
cancelled
and
goes
on
cooldown
.
If
you
die
before
using
Requiem
,
however,
you
can
still
use
it
during
Death
Defied
and
your
opponents
will
be
unable
to
stop
you
in
any
way.
Karthus
can
possibly
proxy
if
you
build
all
mana
due
to
his
Lay
Waste
Dominion
and
Twisted
Treeline
Karthus
is
very
good
at
interrupting
captures
via
Karthus's
Defile
and
Lay
Waste
.
On
Dominion,
Karthus
can
work
as
a
potent
defender
in
bottom
lane
(between
the
Boneyard
and
Quarry),
thanks
to
his
potent
zoning,
ability
to
easily
defend
his
point
until
reinforcements
can
arrive
via
his
passive,
damage
aura
via
Karthus's
Defile
,
and
Lay
Waste
poke,
and
abilty
to
have
a
global
presence
via
Requiem
.
However,
he
is
very
vulnerable
to
ganks
if
overextended.
If
you're
taking
Karthus
as
a
top
laner
on
Dominion
(between
the
Drill
and
Refinery),
Wall
of
Pain
can
prove
quite
useful
as
an
initiation
tool
for
turret
teamfights
(especially
at
the
Windmill),
as
it
increases
the
damage
all
your
allies
deal
while
slowing
the
enemy.
(If
placed
right,
it
can
even
reveal
their
brush!)
By
taking
levels
at
3,
4,
10,
and
the
remaining
two
between
levels
11-18,
you
can
become
frightfully
efficient
at
helping
your
allies
cap
points.
As
such,
taking
Garrison
to
further
improve
your
initiation
can
prove
valuable.
Build
usage
Due
to
Requiem
,
the
enemy
team
will
likely
build
some
magic
resistance.
Building
magic
penetration
items
such
as
Void
Staff
will
help
pass
through
their
defenses.
Will
of
the
Ancients
can
enable
you
to
regain
health
quickly
with
Defile
or
Requiem
,
especially
with
enemy
minions
around.
Lay
Waste
also
gains
full
spell
vamp
when
only
used
to
attack
a
single
enemy.
When
played
as
more
tanky
build,
consider
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
as
a
top-priority
item.
Its
passive
provides
slow
for
all
your
spells,
but
especially
for
Lay
Waste
,
which
you
can
use
to
kite
enemy
with
terrifying
effeciency.
On
either
lane
for
Dominion,
Requiem
has
a
great
deal
of
utility.
Not
only
can
it
be
used
to
secure
kills,
but
it
can
also
slow
via
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
,
butter
up
enemies
for
your
teammates
from
afar,
or
simply
work
as
a
global
capture
interrupter.
Try
building
tanky
on
Karthus
as
you
will
try
to
stay
in
the
teamfight
with
your
Defile
on
and
spam
Lay
Waste
.
Building
an
Archangel's
Staff
is
a
strong
choice
for
Karthus
as
Lay
Waste
can
quickly
build
up
the
Archangel's
staff's
passive.
Void
Staff
has
nice
synergy
with
Wall
of
Pain
.
You
can
lower
the
target's
magic
resistance
by
15%
and
ignoring
35%
of
it,
ending
up
in
50%
when
combined.
Since
the
Wall
of
Pain
now
provides
percentual
magic
resistance
reduction,
it
can
no
longer
decrease
it
below
zero.
Flat
reduction
from
Abyssal
Scepter
has
less
synergy,
but
it
can
still
be
useful
against
champs
with
lower
magic
resistance
.
As
mentioned
previously,
Karthus
can
be
played
as
suicide
initiator.
Build
him
fully
offensive
with
items
such
as
Rabadon's
Deathcap
and
Void
Staff
to
maximize
your
damage
output.
Mejai's
Soulstealer
can
be
viable
even
in
this
build.
You
can
kill
and
assist
easily
with
Death
Defied
,
being
able
to
maintain
more
stacks
even
with
your
death.

Playing
against
Karthus
can
be
extremely
frustrating,
as
avoiding
death
with
a
small
amount
of
health
left
is
nearly
impossible
due
his
Requiem
.
If
you
find
yourself
having
trouble
with
an
enemy
Karthus
,
buying
a
Banshee's
Veil
can
offer
at
least
some
protection
to
his
ultimate.
If
you
are
a
caster
and
wish
different/more
protection,
grabbing
a
Zhonya's
Hourglass
earlier
than
you
normally
would
can
save
you
on
many
occasions.
If
you
are
an
AD
-based
champion
and
wish
for
some
additional
protection,
a
Hexdrinker
or
Maw
of
Malmortius
can
block
250
or
400
magic
damage
respectively
from
his
ultimate
if
he
takes
you
below
30%
health.
Beware
however,
those
items
aren't
as
reliable
as
Zhonya's
Hourglass
.
Elixir
of
Fortitude
is
a
good
counter
to
Karthus's
ultimate
during
the
early
and
mid
game.
It
costs
only
a
fraction
of
the
other
items
which
would
normally
be
used
to
counter
Requiem
.
Always
remember,
especially
during
team
fights,
that
Karthus
can
continue
to
cast
spells
while
he's
dead
without
the
cost
of
mana.
When
engaging
his
team,
kill
Karthus
first,
then
retreat
out
of
his
attack
area
before
continuing
the
fight.
When
in
the
midst
of
a
team
fight,
it
may
be
difficult
to
notice
the
attack
animation
of
his
Lay
Waste
.
Be
wary
of
this
if
you
are
playing
a
squishy
character
and/or
have
little
magic
resistance,
as
Karthus'
damage
output
is
steady
and
deadly.
Also,
do
not
underestimate
the
tick
on
his
Defile
.
It
is
DoT
,
so
it
may
not
be
noticeable
at
first,
but
its
damage
can
be
as
much
as
160
per
second,
not
counting
resistances,
on
top
of
his
damage
from
Lay
Waste
.
Do
not
underestimate
Karthus'
1v1
potential.
He
may
be
squishy,
but
his
killing
power
vastly
increases
when
fighting
stationary,
single
targets.
If
you
engage
him
as
ranged,
try
to
stay
out
of
his
Defile
and
keep
moving
to
avoid
his
Lay
Waste
.
If
you
need
to
remain
stationary,
stay
near
other
targets
that
will
be
damaged
by
his
Lay
Waste
(e.g.:
Allied
minions
or
neutral
monsters)
to
reduce
his
damage
output.
If
you
engage
him
as
melee,
you
should
either
only
do
so
if
you
have
the
level
advantage
or
survivability
to
engage
him
in
his
AoE
spells
and
live.
Karthus's
Wall
of
Pain
reduces
magic
resistance
,
instead
of
penetrating
it.
This
means
that
damage
done
to
you
by
all
enemies
will
be
increased.
Keep
this
in
mind
while
standing
in
or
walking
through
his
Wall
of
Pain
during
a
team
fight.
Some
Karthus
players
will
intentionally
walk
into
a
teamfight
and
die,
This
is
rather
a
great
strategy
if
Karthus
is
in
a
situation
where
he
will
die
because
he
can
cast
his
spells
for
7
seconds
after
his
death.
Make
sure
that
after
you
kill
him,
stay
away
from
his
Defile
.
Do
not
ignore
Karthus
upon
killing
him.
Due
to
his
passive,
he
can
cast
any
and
all
spells
freely,
with
the
only
restriction
being
cooldowns.
Ignoring
this
fact
and
staying
in
close
proximity
to
Karthus
before
his
passive
wears
off
can
often
lead
to
him
killing
you.
Laning
against
Karthus
can
be
challenging
if
you
are
not
aware
of
his
Lay
Waste
.
Without
at
least
one
movement
speed
increasing
item
(e.g.
Boots
of
Speed
)
walking
away
from
your
minions
can
be
costly
even
while
watching
for
Lay
Waste's
if
the
Karthus
is
predicting
your
movements
accurately.
To
avoid
the
doubled
damage,
stand
near
one
or
two
minions.
That
way,
if
Karthus
attempts
to
harass
you
with
Lay
Waste
,
he
is
either
doing
minimal
damage
to
you
and
the
minion
or
placing
it
so
that
you
have
more
time
to
respond,
as
the
AoE
is
only
half
as
close
to
you.
Standing
in
the
middle
of
your
minions
is
a
less
favorable
way
to
reduce
damage
as
the
unit
collision
can
more
or
less
hold
you
in
place
while
Karthus
can
cast
Lay
Waste
s
continually.

Sometimes
it
is
better
to
stand
still
and
go
into
Camouflage
for
an
escape
mechanism
than
to
use
Move
Quick
or
Recall
.
Unlike
other
stealth
abilities,
Teemo
loses
Camouflage
if
knocked
up.
When
playing
Teemo
not
in
mid
lane,
an
easy
way
to
get
First
Blood
is
to
use
Camouflage
just
out
of
range
of
their
turrets'
sight
or
at
the
edge
of
the
bush
closest
to
their
turret,
and
wait
for
the
enemy
champion
to
start
farming.
When
they
move
about
right
next
to
you,
Ignite
and
kill
them
with
the
help
of
the
mid
lane
champion
if
necessary.
Exhaust
would
be
useful
with
this
strategy.
Blinding
Dart
can
be
used
to
harass
effectively
and
can
help
Teemo
kill
physical
champions
in
fights.
Blinding
Dart
with
Exhaust
can
destroy
a
champion
who
relies
heavily
on
physical
attacks
like
Tryndamere
or
Caitlyn
.
Apply
blind
first
then
apply
Exhaust
after
the
blind
has
worn
off.
This
will
allow
your
blind
CD
to
refresh
while
your
enemy
is
exhausted,
minimizing
their
DPS.
If
you
use
both
at
the
same
time,
the
blind
will
override
the
attack
damage/ability
power
reduction.
Similarly,
you
can
use
these
two
abilities
on
two
champions,
effectively
taking
them
out
of
the
battle
for
a
few
seconds.
Blinding
Dart
can
be
used
in-between
autoattacks,
which
allows
2
rapid-fire
attacks.
This
is
extremely
important
to
learn
how
to
use
throughout
the
game.
Opening
with
a
normal
attack,
immediately
using
Blinding
Dart
,
then
proceeding
to
autoattack
will
apply
great
burst
damage,
even
during
laning.
Try
mastering
this
combo
to
use
it
on
the
fly
and
you'll
increase
your
ability
power/attack
speed
damage
tremendously.
If
Blinding
Dart
is
used
on
Fiora
before
she
activates
her
ult
Blade
Waltz
it
will
stop
the
damage
from
the
attacks
but
the
on-hit
affects
will
still
apply,
this
will
dramatically
decrease
the
damage
taken.
This
also
applies
to
Warwick's
Infinite
Duress
.
Use
Move
Quick
to
get
back
to
lane
quicker.
Move
Quick
can
also
be
used
to
get
from
lane
to
lane
very
quickly,
allowing
you
to
help
out
in
fights
all
over
the
map.
Using
Ignite
with
your
poison
can
ensure
kills
on
fleeing
enemies.
One
strategy
is
to
place
some
Noxious
Trap
in
your
lane
and
wait
for
the
enemy
to
push.
After
this,
go
into
Camouflage
.
Then,
after
the
enemy
runs
into
a
couple
of
Noxious
Traps
,
use
Blinding
Dart
and
auto
attacks
to
finish
them.
Placing
a
Noxious
Trap
or
two
behind
the
first
turret
and
before
the
2nd
near
the
paths
to
the
jungle
but
not
in
the
minions'
path
can
turn
an
almost
kill
into
an
easy
kill.
Teemo's
Noxious
Trap
can
be
used
to
farm
creep
waves
very
effectively;
it
is
best
to
keep
your
mushrooms
spread
out
and
not
too
close
to
each
other.
If
a
lane
has
enemy
minions
stacking
on
each
other
(especially
the
ranged
minions),
pop
a
Noxious
Trap
down
in
the
middle
of
them
and
watch
them
all
die
in
just
a
few
seconds.
Use
this
only
if
you
need
to
stop
a
wave
immediately
or
stop
future
waves,
because
it
is
necessary
to
maximize
potential
damage
by
increasing
the
number
of
active
shrooms
on
the
map
to
win.
More
shrooms
=
more
chances
of
hitting
them
=
more
net
damage.
Put
a
Noxious
Trap
at
key
locations
on
the
map,
such
as
by
the
Dragon
or
Baron
Nashor
to
reveal
when
your
enemies
might
be
attempting
to
kill
them
or
to
prevent
ganking
and
make
counter
ganks.
This
is
similar
to
a
Sight
Ward
but
the
range
that
Noxious
Trap
reveals
is
much
smaller.
(Tip:
Place
2.
One
near
the
opening
and
one
behind
the
monster.
The
front
one
will
explode
after
an
enemy
steps
on
it,
thwarting
them
from
starting
Baron
or
dragon,
while
the
back
one
will
allow
you
to
see
the
health
of
the
monster
and
whether
it
is
being
attacked)
Depending
on
the
enemy
teams
melee/range
makeup,
you
can
put
a
Noxious
Trap
to
the
side
of
Baron
Nashor
to
reveal
1
or
2
enemy
melee
champions,
or
you
can
place
them
a
little
behind
the
side
of
the
baron
if
there
are
3
or
more.
This
will
usually
reveal
enemy
melee
champions
currently
attempting
to
slay
Baron
Nashor
.
Put
a
Noxious
Trap
inside
brushes
and
entrances
to
your
lanes
or
your
team's
side
of
the
map
to
ensure
maximum
safety.
When
fighting
against
a
Twisted
Fate
,
be
careful
because
if
he
uses
Destiny
any
Noxious
Traps
near
any
ally
will
be
revealed.
When
laying
down
Noxious
Traps
in
the
jungle,
keep
in
mind
that
the
champion
movement
pathing
often
hugs
the
terrain
as
they
take
the
shortest
route
to
the
selected
location.
Laying
traps
against
walls
at
turning
points
will
increase
the
chance
enemies
will
run
into
them
on
their
way
to/from
lanes.
Placing
down
shrooms
in
the
center
will
allow
for
a
more
permanent
ward
(sometimes).
Also,
when
laying
traps
in
a
lane,
remember
that
minions
travel
through
the
middle,
and
if
the
front
minion
runs
into
it
only
he
and
one
minion
behind
him
will
be
hit.
Placing
them
on
the
sides
can
increase
the
chances
of
hitting
a
champion.
Placing
two
to
three
Noxious
Traps
by
the
enemy
red
or
blue
buff
is
generally
a
good
idea
considering
you
might
just
get
lucky
and
steal
it
from
them
while
slowing
their
farming
down.
It's
sometimes
a
good
idea
to
place
a
few
Noxious
Traps
behind
you
before
entering
a
teamfight,
that
way
if
you
begin
to
lose,
your
team
can
run
off
and
lead
the
enemy
right
into
a
minefield.
If
planting
mushrooms
at
Dragon
or
Baron
Nashor
,
they
will
provide
vision
if
placed
off
to
the
side.
Don't
forget
that
Noxious
Trap
can
be
placed
down
in
team
fights
and
only
has
a
short
time
to
arm
(1
second).
Doing
this
could
secure
a
kill
or
slow
down
a
enemy
when
he/she
is
trying
to
escape.
If
you
are
suspecting
a
possible
towerdive
from
an
opposing
champion,
place
Noxious
Traps
behind
and
in
front
of
your
turret
in
order
to
slow
and
deal
damage
to
the
enemy.
If
an
enemy
is
engaging
you
at
melee
range,
Noxious
Traps
can
be
used
to
peel
them
off
you
by
placing
one
underneath
you
and
stepping
backwards.
Build
usage
Noxious
Trap's
recharge
time
is
greatly
improved
with
cooldown
reduction
.
Nashor's
Tooth
is
excellent
for
this
purpose.
One
build
route
for
Teemo
is
the
physical
damage
route;
this
route
takes
advantage
of
Teemo's
innately
fast
attack
speed
and
quick
attack
animation
along
with
the
attack
speed
boost
his
innate
ability
provides.
This
involves
getting
items
which
boost
attack
damage
and
attack
speed
,
such
as;
Blade
of
the
Ruined
King
,
The
Black
Cleaver
,
Wit's
End
,
Infinity
Edge
and
The
Bloodthirster
.
Note
that
items
like
The
Black
Cleaver
increase
physical
damage,
while
Nashor's
Tooth
increases
magical
damage.
Building
on-hit
effect
with
physical
damage
items
will
reduce
damage
output
if
you
opt
to
buy
those
shred
items.
Nashor's
Tooth
,
for
example,
will
not
increase
the
damage
that
Infinity
Edge
gives,
while
The
Black
Cleaver
will
not
increase
the
damage
that
Wit's
End
deals.
Additionally,
on-hit
effects
cannot
critically
strike
or
proc
life
steal
.
Keep
this
in
mind
when
buying
items
like
Phantom
Dancer
.
A
second
route
is
the
ability
power
route;
this
route
focuses
on
Teemo's
ability
to
deal
damage
via
Blinding
Dart
,
Toxic
Shot
and
Noxious
Trap
.
This
involves
getting
items
which
boost
AP
,
grant
magic
penetration
and
cooldown
reduction
,
such
as;
Deathfire
Grasp
,
Rabadon's
Deathcap
,
Void
Staff
,
Sorcerer's
Shoes
and
Rod
of
Ages
.
Magic
penetration
will
apply
to
already
existing
traps.
Buying
items
such
as
Void
Staff
or
Haunting
Guise
will
greatly
increase
their
damage,
even
if
they
are
bought
while
you
are
dead.
Teemo
can
build
ability
power
and
attack
speed
with
items
that
proc
on-hit
effects,
like
Wit's
End
or
Nashor's
Tooth
.
These
combos
work
well
with
his
poison's
on-hit
effect.
Building
a
Lich
Bane
on
ability
power
Teemo
can
lead
to
huge
bursts
of
damage.
Nashor's
Tooth
benefits
Teemo's
on-hit
damage,
due
to
its
new
passive.
However,
the
cooldown
reduction
gives
more
opportunities
to
cast
Blinding
Dart
and
Noxious
Trap
,
which
provides
much
utility.
If
building
Teemo
into
a
mage,
Nashor's
Tooth
is
a
must.
Blade
of
the
Ruined
King
gives
Teemo
an
additional
on-hit
effect
while
providing
life
steal
in
one
item.
With
Runaan's
Hurricane
,
Toxic
Shot
s
can
proc
on
up
to
2
additional
enemies.
Liandry's
Torment
combined
with
Noxious
Trap
deal
massive
amount
of
health
burn,
up
to
4%
per
second
per
mushroom.
The
base
amount
is
2%,
doubled
when
the
movement
is
impaired.
The
health
burn
will
refresh
every
poison
tick,
which
occurs
every
one
second.
This
means
the
total
burn
will
equal
20%.
4
seconds
of
doubled
damage
totallying
16%
and
2
seconds
of
normal
damage
countinuing
after
the
poison
expires
totalling
4%.
Toxic
Shot
does
NOT
trigger
Liandry's
Torment's
passive
because
it
is
an
on-hit
effect.
Although
Teemo
has
a
slow
basic
movement
speed,
Move
Quick
significantly
increases
this
out
of
combat.
Combined
with
Boots
of
Mobility
and
Lich
Bane
Teemo
can
move
between
lanes
and
get
back
to
lane
very
quickly.
However,
if
an
enemy
runs
into
one
of
your
traps,
you
will
be
in
combat.
This
means
the
bonus
movement
speed
from
Boots
of
Mobility
will
be
removed.
Guinsoo's
Rageblade
is
an
item
that
works
well
with
on-hit
effect
builds.
It
gives
Teemo
additional
attack
speed
and
ability
power
both
of
which
work
well
with
his
Toxic
Shot
.
A
build
that
uses
Nashor's
Tooth
,
Wit's
End
and
Guinsoo's
Rageblade
can
do
significant
damage.

Countering
Purchasing
Doran's
Shield
can
counter
Teemo
early
game
by
reducing
damage
from
his
autoattacks,
the
initial
damage
from
Toxic
Shot
,
and
the
damage
over
time
from
Toxic
Shot
.
This
is
especially
useful
for
melee
champions
who
will
take
occasional
harass
from
Teemo
in
lane.
Purchasing
,
The
Lightbringer
or
Hextech
Sweeper
will
help
you
see
his
Noxious
Trap
or
Teemo
himself
that
is
hidden
with
his
Camouflage
.
Alternatively,
you
can
set
up
Vision
Ward
in
the
strategic
place
where
you
think
Teemo
will
place
his
Noxious
Trap
.
When
facing
Teemo
as
a
DPS
champion
that
is
auto-attack
reliant,
it
is
best
advised
to
buy
a
Quicksilver
Sash
to
remove
the
blind
CC
from
his
Blinding
Dart
.
Use
a
Health
Potion
when
you
are
low
on
health
and
are
affected
by
Toxic
Shot
,
that
way
you
can
negate
the
poison
damage
from
his
Toxic
Shot
.
Since
most
of
Teemo's
damage
output
comes
from
autoattacks
with
his
Toxic
Shot
,
consider
building
Randuin's
Omen
and
Frozen
Heart
.
More
especially
so
with
the
former
as
it's
passive
and
active
can
negate
Move
Quick
.
Keep
in
note
that
Toxic
Shot
deals
a
lot
of
magic
damage
instead
of
physical
damage
and
you
still
need
some
magic
resistance
along
with
attack
speed
reduction.
When
chasing
an
enemy
Teemo
that
enters
Camouflage
,
area
of
effect
and
skill
shot
abilities
can
forcibly
cause
Teemo
to
break
stealth
and
attempt
to
escape.
Knockback
effects
will
break
Teemo's
Camouflage
as
well.
When
facing
AP
build
Teemo
during
early
game,
they
will
typically
poke
and
run,
letting
their
poison
deal
damage
and
lowering
your
health
gradually,
until
they
are
able
to
burst.
Be
prepared
to
pull
away
if
he
approaches,
and
use
Health
Potions
to
keep
your
health
high.
Do
not
chase
Teemo
if
he
attacks
once
and
then
runs,
particularly
AP
Teemo
,
as
he
is
most
likely
luring
you
through
a
field
of
Noxious
Traps
.
Because
much
of
Teemo's
early
game
poke
is
damage
over
time,
the
Unyielding
mastery
is
more
effective
in
decreasing
his
poke
damage.
If
you
are
using
a
champion
whose
damage
output
is
either
strongly
or
entirely
based
on
their
auto
attacks
(ex.
Tristana
,
Vayne
,
Kog'Maw
,
or
even
Teemo
himself)
you
need
to
purchase
items
to
mitigate
Teemo's
Blinding
Dart
Quicksilver
Sash
and
items
providing
Tenacity
are
quite
useful
(ex.
Mercury's
Treads
and
Zephyr
)
Spirit
of
the
Ancient
Golem
works
better
to
this
end
for
champions
in
need
of
more
survivability.
Teemo
is
often
played
top
lane
and
very
rarely
mid
lane
because
his
Blinding
Dart
,
his
damage
over
time
with
his
Toxic
Shot
and
his
kiting
kit
potential
with
his
Move
Quick
and
Noxious
Traps
can
give
most
melee
bruisers
(i.e.
Garen
,
Riven
,
Nasus
,
Renekton
,
Jax
,
Gangplank
,
Wukong
,
Tryndamere
,
Aatrox
,
Rengar
,
Olaf
,
Trundle
,
and
Darius
),
assassins
(i.e.
Fizz
,
Akali
,
Master
Yi
,
and
Diana
)
an
extremely
hard
time.
However,
keep
in
note
that
Blinding
Dart
only
blocks
auto-attacks
and
does
not
block
damage
and
crowd-control
effects
from
abilities.
Because
of
this,
AP
mages
with
spells
that
can
outrange
and
outpush
him
(i.e.
Lux
and
Ziggs
)
or
AD
casters
with
spammable
ranged
abilities
(i.e.
Pantheon
and
Zed
)
can
lane
decently
well
against
Teemo
and
zone
him
out.
In
addition,
Noxious
Traps
grants
Teemo
strong
map
control
by
granting
minor
vision
in
addition
to
the
strong
slow
and
damage
over
time
makes
Teemo
relatively
difficult
to
gank
after
level
6.
Coordinate
with
your
jungler
before
level
6
to
shut
down
his
farming
and
bring
Oracle's
Lens
if
necessary.
Yorick
is
considered
to
be
a
strong
counter
to
Teemo
for
many
reasons.
First,
his
passive,
Unholy
Covenant
mitigates
a
lot
of
Teemo
's
poking
harass,
including
Toxic
Shot
.
Second,
Yorick
is
able
to
out-sustain
Teemo
with
his
Omen
of
Famine
.
Third,
his
kit
functions
more
of
a
ranged
AD
caster
rather
than
an
autoattacker,
thus
making
Teemo's
Blinding
Dart
useless.
Finally,
Yorick
can
use
his
ghouls
to
safely
detonate
Noxious
Traps
in
a
safe
distance,
thus
denying
Teemo
lane
and
map
control.

Trivia
Skill
usage
While
some
might
have
played
manaless
champions
before,
Renekton's
Fury
resource
(shared
with
Tryndamere
and
Shyvana
)
can
catch
many
players
who
are
unfamiliar
with
Renekton
off-guard.
While
he
needs
fury
to
enhance
his
abilities,
he
does
not
need
it
to
cast
them.
Try
to
use
this
to
your
advantage.
Cull
the
Meek
heals
more
when
an
enemy
champion
is
hit;
try
to
use
this
to
your
advantage.
Empowered
Cull
the
Meek
grants
excellent
lane
sustain
thanks
to
its
increased
damage
and
healing
cap.
Take
advantage
of
this
by
building
fury,
then
hitting
as
many
enemy
minions
as
once
to
greatly
increase
your
health
gain.
Keep
in
mind
that
the
normal
version
of
Cull
the
Meek
grants
fury
while
the
empowered
version
does
not.
Ruthless
Predator
resets
the
attack
timer
after
usage,
resulting
in
a
possible
fourth
attack.
Keep
in
mind
that
Renekton
is
not
able
to
move
while
hitting
with
Ruthless
Predator
.
Slice
and
Dice
has
a
number
of
great
uses
thanks
to
its
mobility.
When
you
need
to
make
a
quick
escape,
use
Slice
and
Dice
into
a
minion
wave
or
champion.
This
will
trigger
the
secondary
effect,
allowing
you
to
use
it
again
and
clear
distance
very
quickly.
When
moving
through
the
jungle,
you
can
use
Slice
and
Dice
to
go
through
some
walls.
Ideally,
try
to
Slice
through
walls
where
you
will
hit
a
monster
camp
on
the
other
side,
allowing
you
to
cast
Dice
for
increased
chasing
or
escaping
effectiveness.
Slice
and
Dice
can
be
used
to
harass
enemies
who
have
their
abilities
on
cooldown
.
Slice
in,
land
a
few
hits,
and
Dice
back
out
of
range
in
time
before
the
enemy
champion
has
time
to
react
properly.
Remember
that
the
second,
not
the
first,
dash
of
Slice
and
Dice
with
loaded
Fury
will
activate
the
bonus.
Slice
and
Dice
in
combination
with
Ruthless
Predator
is
good
for
attacking
ranged
champions,
since
Slice
and
Dice
gets
you
close
while
Ruthless
Predator
stuns
the
target.
Once
again,
make
sure
you
slice
through
minions
or
champions
so
you
can
dice
the
rest
of
the
way
if
needed.
Slice
and
Dice
provides
excellent
mobility
for
dodging
skill
shots
in
lane.
When
you
see
an
enemy
lining
one
up
Slice
through
nearby
minions
out
of
the
way,
and
then
activate
Dice
to
further
re-position
yourself.
Although
they
aren't
on-next-attack
abilities,
Cull
the
Meek
and
Slice
and
Dice
also
reset
Renekton's
autoattack
timer.
Try
to
weave
all
his
abilities
in
between
autoattacks
to
increase
your
DPS
substantially.
These
autoattacks
also
generate
fury,
so
do
not
neglect
them!
Dominus
increases
the
range
of
Cull
the
Meek

use
this
to
your
advantage
in
team
fights.
Dominus
allows
Renekton
to
easily
win
duels
thanks
to
its
mix
of
instant
health
gain,
damage,
and
Fury
gain,
allowing
him
to
make
sudden
comebacks.
If
both
you
and
your
opponent
are
low
on
health
and
Dominus
is
available
try
to
lure
them
in
and
use
it
to
get
an
easily
kill.
Renekton
can
jungle
with
Reign
of
Anger
and
Cull
the
Meek
.
Deciding
how
to
use
Renekton's
fury
bonus
on
abilities
is
very
important.
The
added
heal
from
Cull
the
Meek
can
help
you
sustain
better
in
lane
or
in
the
jungle.
A
increased
stun
from
Ruthless
Predator
will
lock
down
an
enemy
longer
when
pursuing
or
escaping.
The
armor
reduction
from
Slice
and
Dice
is
increases
physical
damage
dealt
by
yourself
and
the
rest
of
your
team.
By
activating
Ruthless
Predator
during
a
dash
from
Slice
and
Dice's
and
selecting
a
champion
as
your
next
basic
attack,
you
can
dash
into
an
enemy
and
stun
them
immediately.
Build
usage
Renekton
is
a
tanky
attack
damage
caster,
relying
on
health
and
resistances
to
sustain
himself
in
teamfights
and
cooldown
reduction
to
maintain
his
fury.
Damage
Hexdrinker
and
Maw
of
Malmortius
are
strong
items
on
Renekton
,
providing
additional
damage
and
durability
against
magic
damage
.
Maw
of
Malmortius
scales
very
well
with
Renekton
's
passive,
Reign
of
Anger
,
due
to
increased
fury
generation
while
also
having
an
additional
20+
AD
when
below
50%
life
,
increasing
all
damage
output
significantly.
The
combination
of
The
Black
Cleaver
and
Ruthless
Predator
,
which
triggers
on-hit
effects
,
can
give
the
target
3
stacks
of
the
armor
reduction
debuff
almost
instantly.
Using
this
at
the
beginning
of
a
fight
can
decide
its
outcome.
Last
Whisper
can
be
more
effective
if
his
enemies
have
built
a
significant
amount
of
armor
.
It
works
well
regardless
of
whether
Renekton
uses
the
fury
empowered
Slice
and
Dice
.
If
you
are
having
problems
sustaining
yourself
with
Cull
the
Meek
alone,
The
Bloodthirster
/
Blade
of
the
Ruined
King
synergize
well
as
their
effects
proc
on
all
three
hits
of
Ruthless
Predator
.
Ravenous
Hydra
can
be
an
acceptable
alternative
to
The
Bloodthirster
.
The
area
of
effect
adds
to
the
other
AoEs
that
Renekton
already
has
and
the
active
can
be
used
to
cancel
the
animation
of
Ruthless
Predator
which
tends
to
undesirably
hold
Renekton
in
place.
Boots
Mercury's
Treads
are
the
standard
boots
for
Renekton
,
as
he
is
required
to
be
in
the
middle
of
skirmishes
and
thus
will
be
often
afflicted
with
crowd
control
.
Ninja
Tabi
are
good
if
laning
against
physical
damage
champions,
such
as
Riven
or
Garen
.
Ionian
Boots
of
Lucidity
grants
cooldown
reduction
,
which
is
a
valuable
stat
on
Renekton.
However,
this
item
is
only
recommended
if
Renekton
is
snowballing
or
the
team
is
tanky
enough
and
needs
more
damage.
Health
Randuin's
Omen
is
a
good
defensive
item,
offering
armor
,
health
and
a
movement
speed
slow.
Sunfire
Cape
is
a
very
useful
item
on
Renekton
as
it
synergizes
well
with
his
ultimate,
adding
even
more
AoE
magic
damage
.
It
is
also
easier
for
Renekton
to
get
into
the
middle
of
the
enemy
champions
due
to
his
Slice
and
Dice
.
Phage
gives
Renekton
some
much
needed
health
,
as
he
is
pretty
squishy
without
items
early
and
mid
game.
Frozen
Mallet
is
a
very
good
item
for
Renekton
as
its
movement
speed
slow
allows
him
to
stay
in
range
and
constantly
use
his
abilities.
Cooldown
Reduction
Spirit
Visage
can
be
a
very
good
item
when
using
Cull
the
Meek
,
since
it
boosts
all
healing
effects
by
20%
and
giving
Renekton
some
needed
cooldown
reduction
.
Zephyr
is
a
good
item
for
Renekton
as
it
provides
AD
,
attack
speed
,
movement
speed
and
most
importantly
provides
Tenacity
which
allows
him
to
use
boots
other
than
Mercury's
Treads
even
when
playing
against
champions
with
a
lot
of
crowd
control
.
The
Black
Cleaver
is
a
great
item
for
Renekton.
It
gives
attack
damage
,
cooldown
reduction
,
armor
penetration
and
a
stacking
armor
reduction
passive.
Therefore,
The
Brutalizer
is
an
essential
core
item
on
many
Renekton
players,
granting
early
AD
and
CDR.

Renekton
has
an
extremely
strong
laning
phase
and
very
high
early
game
damage
because
of
the
high
base
damage
his
abilities
have,
especially
their
Fury
Empowered
versions.
On
the
other
hand,
despite
his
strong
early
game
power,
Renekton
is
highly
vulnerable
on
being
poked
down
early
and
his
main
gap
closer,
Slice
and
Dice
is
relatively
short.
Ranged
champions
with
good
kiting
mechanics
such
as
Teemo
.
Kennen
,
Jayce
,
Ryze
,
Nidalee
,
Kayle
,
and
Lulu
can
crowd
control
Renekton
and/or
safely
create
distance
between
Renekton
and
kite
safely.
Keep
in
note
that
Renekton
does
not
use
mana
as
a
resource,
has
a
built
in
heal
with
empowered
Cull
the
Meek
,
and
can
build
common
lifesteal
items
such
as
Ravenous
Hydra
to
stay
in
lane
longer.
Build
accordingly
to
counter
him.
Watch
his
Fury
bar.
Renekton
will
usually
be
passive
until
he
gains
fury,
then
attack
you
with
Slice
and
Dice
,
hit
you
with
a
Fury
empowered
Cull
the
Meek
or
Ruthless
Predator
and
back
off
with
Slice
and
Dice's
secondary
dash.
Position
yourself
in
the
brush
and
make
yourself
hard
to
reach
for
Renekton
,
force
him
to
get
out
of
position.
Never
get
careless
against
Renekton
:
He
has
a
powerful
combination
of
a
stun
,
mobility
and
sustain.
Due
to
Renekton
's
&quot;AD
caster&quot;
playstyle,
he's
extremely
weakened
and
disrupted
by
silences
,
but
not
blinds
.
Keep
this
in
mind
when
playing
against
him.
One
of
Renekton
's
biggest
weaknesses
is
powerful
burst
nukers.
Excluding
Slice
and
Dice's
mobility,
he's
essentially
a
melee
character
that's
easy
to
be
bursted
down
from
a
range
and
kited
with
crowd
control
.
Renekton
has
a
naturally
high
health
pool,
further
complimented
by
Dominus
,
which
leaves
him
vulnerable
to
items
and
abilities
that
deal
percent
health
damage
like
Deathfire
Grasp
unless
he
has
built
resistances.
Usually
Renekton's
Slice
and
Dice
can
be
used
once,
but
if
it
hits
an
enemy,
he
gains
the
ability
to
use
it
twice.
This
will
allow
Renekton
to
cover
over
800
units
of
distance.
If
the
situation
allows
it,
don't
let
him
hit
an
enemy
with
Slice
and
Dice
,
which
can
be
difficult
as
he
can
use
the
ability
on
minions
.
At
level
6,
Renekton
gains
the
access
to
use
Dominus
.
It
can
make
turret
diving
him
a
very
difficult
task
because
he
will
quickly
be
able
to
receive
a
large
bonus
of
health
,
which
is
also
essentially
a
heal
that
cannot
be
reduced
by
Ignite
.
It
will
also
grant
him
access
to
a
lot
of
bonus
Fury
which
can
net
him
a
powerful
heal
from
Cull
the
Meek
or
an
extra
long
stun
from
Ruthless
Predator
.
Dominus
is
an
extremely
powerful
ability,
especially
in
the
early
to
mid
stages
of
the
game.
The
extra
health
makes
a
Renekton
in
this
form
more
durable
than
most
champions.
The
additional
fury
and
AoE
damage
can
enable
Renekton
to
dish
out
deceptive
and
overwhelming
amounts
of
damage,
essentially
being
able
to
kill
two
champions
by
himself
easily.
Approach
a
level
6
Renekton
with
care.
Be
sure
to
build
armor
when
playing
against
Renekton
.
He
deals
high
bursts
of
physical
damage
.
Renekton
might
choose
to
build
more
towards
damage
or
tanking.
Pay
attention
to
this:
If
you
force
him
to
build
tanky
he
will
greatly
fall
off
late
game
because
of
the
nature
of
his
kit.
If
he
builds
towards
damage,
prioritize
him
accordingly
in
teamfights
and
be
sure
to
lock
him
down
with
crowd
control
.
He
has
extremely
high
ability
ratios
but
low
survivability
outside
of
health,
sustain,
and
Dominus
.
While
tanky
DPS
Renekton
greatly
loses
power
late
game,
he's
very
difficult
to
deal
with
early
to
mid
game.
You
should
try
to
isolate
him
out
of
teamfights
and
always
know
his
location.

Darius
Champion
Background
Strategy
Skins
&amp;
Trivia
Skill
Usage
Darius
is
generally
a
strong
solo
top
champion
due
to
his
durability
and
harassment
ability,
and
he
can
easily
gain
lane
control
against
most
other
melee
tank/bruiser
opponents.
Decimate
is
Darius'
harassment
ability.
Strike
enemy
champions
from
maximum
range
for
the
greatest
effect.
Liberally
apply
Hemorrhage
whenever
the
opponent
is
in
range.
This
works
better
when
some
armor
is
obtained
to
negate
minion
retaliation.
Against
careless
opponents,
a
surprise
Apprehend
followed
by
Crippling
Strike
can
force
an
enemy
to
tank
some
turret
shots.
Darius
relies
largely
on
Decimate
to
deal
effective
damage
in
lane,
without
this
ability
he
is
fairly
vulnerable
to
other
champions.
Hence,
use
this
ability
sparingly
as
many
champions
can
all-in
on
you
when
you
do
not
have
your
Decimate
up.
Crippling
Strike
resets
your
autoattack
timer,
so
use
it
right
after
a
basic
attack
to
add
some
extra
damage.
This
can
be
used
for
pushing
towers.
Crippling
Strike
decreases
attack
speed,
making
a
one-versus-one
more
favorable
if
the
enemy
relies
on
attacks
and
attack
speed.
Take
into
consideration
which
champion
you
are
facing,
and
properly
utilizing
this
skill
can
help
shut
down
the
enemy.
In
addition,
this
makes
you
fairly
deadly
to
any
Ranged
Attack-Damage
Carries,
as
you
reduce
their
damage
output
by
a
large
margin.
Noxian
Guillotine
deals
more
damage
based
on
additional
Hemorrhage
stacks.
Try
to
activate
it
on
targets
with
max
stacks
to
deal
the
full
damage
of
the
ability.
You
can
combo
Decimate
-&gt;
Apprehend
-&gt;
basic
attack
-&gt;
Crippling
Strike
to
quickly
apply
3
stacks
of
Hemorrhage
in
a
very
short
time.
The
slow
will
also
allow
you
to
land
further
attacks
to
maximize
Noxian
Guillotine's
damage.
Try
to
avoid
pulling
enemies
in
with
Apprehend
and
then
using
Decimate
,
as
this
deals
less
damage.
If
possible
Decimate
first
to
deal
the
bonus
damage.
However,
if
you
activate
Apprehend
to
initiate,
you
can
then
use
Decimate
when
the
enemy
tries
to
run
out
of
your
range
in
order
to
utilise
the
bonus
damage
of
Decimate
.
This
is
especially
useful
in
the
laning
phase
for
harass.
Apprehend
is
a
strong
crowd
control
ability
in
teamfights,
but
be
careful
who
you
pull.
Pulling
tanks
such
as
Alistar
or
Amumu
might
backfire.
Apprehend
can
pull
people
and
minions
over
walls.
It
is
useful
for
separating
enemies
from
their
team
or
grabbing
blue/red
buff
from
a
safer
location.
Apprehend
is
a
strong
initiation
skill,
but
is
much
better
at
keeping
people
in
the
fight.
Build
Usage
Darius
has
strong
bonus
attack
damage
scaling,
so
building
accordingly
would
be
prudent.
Against
an
armor-heavy
team,
getting
The
Black
Cleaver
is
great.
It
gives
more
attack
damage
that
scales
with
your
abilities
and
armor
reduction
to
soften
your
targets
up.
Since
the
passive
from
Apprehend
already
gives
Darius
armor
penetration,
building
a
Last
Whisper
will
turn
Darius
into
a
potent
armor
penetrator.
The
Bloodthirster
is
a
potent,
if
expensive
way
to
solve
Darius's
lack
of
sustain,
and
benefit
his
high
AD
scaling.
Purchase
the
Vampiric
Scepter
early
to
help
Darius
in
the
laning
phase.
However,
keep
in
mind
that
Darius
is
usually
a
prime
target
during
teamfights
due
to
the
threat
of
Noxian
Guillotine
,
and
will
die
quickly
if
not
built
with
at
least
some
health
and
defensive
stats.
A
high
threat
glass
cannon
in
melee
range
will
die
most
of
the
time.
Darius
has
trouble
sticking
to
targets
without
Crippling
Strike
and
Apprehend
up,
so
an
early
Phage
would
be
helpful.
The
combination
of
the
slow
from
Crippling
Strike
and
Phage's
bonus
movement
speed
combined
with
the
movement
speed
from
Hemorrhage
will
allow
you
to
stick
to
almost
any
target.
An
alternative
to
Phage
and
Trinity
Force
is
Frozen
Mallet
,
which
synergizes
well
with
Darius
'
AD
scaling
and
his
need
for
health
items
due
to
being
melee.
The
double
slow
on
Frozen
Mallet
will
bring
most
enemies
to
a
crawl.
An
early
Hexdrinker
will
greatly
help
Darius
against
magic
damage-dealing
champions
who
can
oppose
his
solo
top
lane
control,
such
as
Rumble
.
The
resulting
upgrade
Maw
of
Malmortius
is
a
great
way
for
Darius
to
get
much-needed
magic
resistance
,
while
still
improving
his
damage.
Warden's
Mail
gives
Darius
some
early
sustain
and
the
upper
hand
against
AD-champions,
since
fighting
back
will
make
their
escape
even
harder.
It
can
later
upgrade
to
a
Frozen
Heart
for
cooldown
reduction
for
his
skills
and
even
more
armor,
making
him
tough
to
kill
and
increasing
damage
output
through
skills.
Darius
has
no
movement
abilities
or
other
escapes,
so
getting
a
Quicksilver
Sash
will
help
against
teams
that
try
to
lock
you
down
with
crowd
control.
Trinity
Force
can
be
used
to
great
effect
on
Darius
despite
the
ability
power
waste,
due
to
his
low
cooldowns
and
short
range
ability
combos,
it
becomes
easy
to
proc
Sheen
multiple
times
in
a
matter
of
seconds,
and
also
provides
some
relief
on
his
low
mana
problems.
Infinity
Edge
is
sometimes
picked
up
on
Darius
for
the
immense
DPS
it
grants.
When
combined
with
Crippling
Strike
,
it's
possible
to
hit
for
450%
of
your
attack
damage
in
a
single
strike.
Infinity
Edge
is
a
very
big
investment
for
a
bruiser
and
should
only
be
picked
up
if
you're
doing
well.
Tiamat
and
later
on
a
Ravenous
Hydra
can
give
some
good
lane
sustain,
and
can
turn
Darius
from
a
good
farmer
into
an
excellent
one
due
to
the
cleave
and
respectably
the
crescent
activated
ability;
stand
in
the
middle
of
a
group
of
minions,
use
cleave/crescent
and
then
Decimate
to
instantly
clear
a
wave.

Countering
Building
armor
to
negate
Darius
'
damage
is
not
as
recommended
as
against
other
physical
damage
dealers,
since
his
ultimate
deals
true
damage,
his
passive
deals
magic
damage
and
he
has
passive
precentile
armor
penetration.
As
such,
building
health
is
a
more
suitable
counter.
Even
though
the
damage
of
Hemorrhage
is
initially
negligible,
do
not
let
Darius
stack
it.
This
will
cause
Noxian
Guillotine
to
deal
double
damage
(if
you
have
5
stacks),
and
the
cooldown
of
his
Crippling
Strike
will
be
lower.
Thus,
from
there,
Darius
can
also
build
fairly
tanky
more
so
compared
to
other
off-tanks
of
similar
caliber,
due
to
his
naturally
high
damage
stacks;
be
very
wary
if
a
tanky
Darius
plans
to
initiate
for
his
team.
Kayle
is
an
absolute
counter
to
Darius
throughout
the
game.
In
lane,
Kayle
can
kite
Darius
with
Reckoning
,
Divine
Blessing
,
and
Righteous
Fury
.
This
allows
her
to
farm
from
a
distance,
win
trades,
harass
safely,
and
out-sustain
Darius.
Should
an
extended
fight
occur
which
leads
to
Darius
attempting
to
use
Noxian
Guillotine
,
Kayle's
Intervention
can
be
used
to
block
the
damage
from
the
skill,
and
force
Noxian
Guillotine
on
cooldown.
At
all
ranks,
Intervention
has
a
lower
cooldown
than
Noxian
Guillotine,
so
it
should
always
be
available
to
stop
Darius'
Ultimate.
Intervention
can
also
be
used
on
allies
in
teamfights
to
save
them
from
Noxian
Guillotine
,
allowing
Kayle
to
stop
Darius
cold
even
past
the
lane
phase.
Darius
has
a
high
damage
output,
but
he
lacks
any
form
of
escape
mechanism.
This
makes
Darius
very
prone
to
crowd
control
spells.
Remember
that
Darius
has
poor
sustain.
Try
to
harass
him
whenever
you
can
to
counter
him
from
zoning
you.
Darius
relies
on
his
Decimate
to
deal
effective
damage
in
lane,
it
also
has
a
moderately
high
cooldown
early
game.
Punish
him
if
he
misses
his
Decimate
.
Remember
that
towers
will
automatically
target
any
enemy
champion
who
damages
an
allied
champion
within
their
range.
This
is
important
for
countering
Darius
as
it
means
he
cannot
approach
a
tower
while
Hemorrhage
is
applied
to
a
champion
within
it's
range.
Use
this
to
escape
Darius
by
moving
near
enough
to
the
tower
to
deny
him
a
kill,
or
use
it
to
attack
Darius
via
tossing
or
pulling
him
to
the
tower.
Quicksilver
Sash
not
only
removes
hard
disables,
but
also
clears
a
wide
variety
of
debuffs.
Once
Darius
applies
five
stacks
of
Hemorrhage
and
activates
Noxian
Guillotine
,
you
can
activate
Quicksilver
Sash
while
he's
mid-cast
to
greatly
reduce
the
incoming
damage
from
the
ultimate.
This
can
potentially
turn
the
fight
in
your
favor
and
deny
Darius
the
ultimate
refresh
he
needs
to
continue
a
rampage.
Shields,
especially
high-health
shields
like
those
from
Karma's
Defiance
can
be
used
to
deny
Darius's
Noxian
Guillotine
a
finishing
blow,
setting
it
on
full
cooldown
and
drastically
reducing
Darius's
presence
in
team
fights
Keep
a
close
eye
on
low-health
allies
and/or
allies
with
lots
of
Hemorrhage
stacks,
since
those
are
likely
to
be
the
targets
of
Noxian
Guillotine
.
Shields/heals
can
be
cast
during
the
start
up
animation
of
Noxian
Guillotine
,
since
the
casting
time
is
long
enough,
and
activating
a
shield
too
early
can
result
in
Darius
simply
waiting
for
the
bonus
health
to
expire.
A
well
timed
Sivir's
Spell
Shield
and
Nocturne's
Shroud
of
Darkness
can
nullify
Darius'
Ultimate.
Darius
is
exceptionally
vulnerable
to
being
kited,
due
to
the
cooldown
and
short
range
of
Apprehend
(the
range
is
shorter
in
practice
than
the
attack
range
of
every
ranged
champion
with
the
marksman
tag),
and
his
lack
of
other
gap
closers.
Any
sort
of
champion
that
can
close
the
gap
almost
instantly
on
Darius
(for
example
Jax
or
Fiora
)
is
also
acceptable
because
of
the
fact
Decimate
deals
less
damage
inside
its
range.
Noxian
Guillotine
can't
hit
stealthed
units.
If
you
use
an
instant
stealth
spell
while
he
is
channeling
his
ult
,
Darius
will
stop
his
ultimate
mid
air,
due
to
not
having
a
target.
However,
it
will
not
go
on
cooldown,
like
all
targeted
spells
that
lose
their
targets.
Remember
that
his
range
is
short,
so
every
ability
with
long
range
can
be
used
to
harass
him.

Don't
hesitate
to
spam
your
spells
since
Deadly
Cadence
makes
each
additional
cast
cheaper.
Noxious
Blast
does
not
require
a
target,
so
maintaining
your
5
stacks
is
easy
with
a
decent-sized
mana
pool.
Try
to
acquire
5
stacks
of
Deadly
Cadence
before
casting
Petrifying
Gaze
to
lower
its
mana
cost
significantly.
Cassiopeia
is
a
great
harasser
in
all
stages
of
the
game.
All
three
of
her
basic
abilities,
especially
Noxious
Blast
,
can
be
used
constantly
in
lane
to
zone,
capable
of
dealing
huge
amounts
of
damage
over
time
at
a
safe
distance.
Noxious
Blast
has
a
slight
delay;
lead
your
enemy
when
targeting
with
Noxious
Blast
to
ensure
the
hit,
or
use
it
on
them
when
they
will
have
to
stand
still
to
last-hit.
Using
Noxious
Blast
in
the
brush
does
not
reveal
Cassiopeia
,
so
when
in
the
side
lanes,
use
the
brush
to
your
advantage
to
harass
with
little
to
no
retaliation
from
enemy
minions.
When
chasing/fleeing,
be
sure
to
use
your
Noxious
Blast
on
an
enemy
champion
to
speed
yourself
up,
and
Miasma
to
slow
them
down.
Using
Miasma
in
the
middle
of
the
lane
when
enemy
minions
are
coming
will
slow
them
and
deal
some
damage
giving
advantage
to
your
minions,
this
tactic
is
best
used
in
pushes
as
intentionally
pushing
your
lane
during
the
laning
phase
opens
yourself
up
to
ganks.
Since
Miasma
grants
vision
over
the
area
affected,
it
can
be
used
to
check
brush.
Noxious
Blast
can
also
be
used
to
check
brush,
as
it
gives
you
a
movement
speed
bonus
(and
a
buff
icon)
if
an
enemy
is
hit.
If
you
cast
it
in
a
brush,
and
notice
the
buff
icon,
you
know
that
an
enemy
is
there.
Twin
Fang
becomes
extremely
powerful
if
the
target
is
poisoned,
allowing
you
to
deal
out
large
amounts
of
damage
with
its
low
conditional
cooldown.
It
is
very
highly
recommended
to
smart
cast
Twin
Fang
,
as
it
will
make
it
much
easier
to
land
the
maximum
amount
of
Twin
Fang
allowed
by
the
duration
of
your
poison
effects.
If
the
situation
is
favorable,
try
to
cast
Twin
Fang
while
directly
on
top
of
your
target,
as
Twin
Fang's
reduced
cooldown
begins
when
the
poisoned
target
is
hit
and
not
on
spellcast.
Due
to
Twin
Fang
having
the
potential
to
be
constantly
refreshed,
don't
be
afraid
to
target
durable
melee
champions
if
necessary.
Unlike
many
other
mages
that
rely
on
burst
damage,
Cassiopeia
and
her
Twin
Fang
can
realistically
cut
through
tough
enemies
with
time,
accuracy,
and
enough
mana.
Try
to
use
Petrifying
Gaze
offensively,
and
usually
against
more
than
one
target.
That
said,
it
can
also
be
used
when
being
ganked
to
escape
enemies.
It
is,
however,
safest
to
use
it
when
a
teamfight
has
happened.
The
enemy
will
be
less
likely
to
manage
to
turn
around
with
their
attention
split
amongst
five
champions
-
and
more
likely
to
all
be
facing
you
since
that
is
largely
required
to
fight
your
team.
Using
Petrifying
Gaze
followed
by
Miasma
,
Noxious
Blast
and
Twin
Fang
can
turn
most
1v1
fights
and
mid
game
turret
dives
in
your
favor.
Petrifying
Gaze
also
allows
Cassiopeia
to
be
a
very
strong
anti-ganker.
Simply
casting
it
when
your
lane
opponent
and
the
enemy
ganker
are
in
range,
then
bursting
down
the
weaker
one
with
your
combo
can
turn
the
2v1
into
a
1v1.
This
tactic
is
only
effective
when
your
Petrifying
Gaze
stuns
both
targets.
Cassiopeia
can
proxy
through
the
use
of
Noxious
Blast
and
Miasma
Build
usage
Buying
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
,
Will
of
the
Ancients
and
Liandry's
Torment
along
with
using
Twin
Fang
on
a
poisoned
enemy
gives
her
much
more
chasing
potential,
health
sustain,
burst
and
sustained
damage
but
don't
forget
to
hit
the
enemy
with
Noxious
Blast
from
time-to-time
to
refresh
the
poison
and
the
movement
speed
bonus
for
yourself.
Due
to
the
recent
buff
on
Rylai's
proc
with
Twin
Fang,
it
is
a
good
idea
to
purchase
it
for
chasing
potential.
Also,
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
plus
Miasma
adds
a
very
powerful
slow
to
your
enemies,
giving
Cassiopeia
more
time
to
chase
and
land
Twin
Fang
easily.
Void
Staff
works
fine
on
Cassiopeia
if
enough
enemies
have
a
high
amount
of
magic
resistance,
as
the
potential
low-cooldown
and
damage
on
Twin
Fang
lets
Cassiopeia
be
less
stringent
in
choosing
targets
compared
to
other
mages.
Buy
spell
vamp
items
like
Will
of
the
Ancients
to
quickly
restore
health
when
hitting
poisoned
targets
with
Twin
Fang
.
A
Catalyst
the
Protector
is
a
perfect
early
game
item
for
Cassiopeia
allowing
her
to
spam
her
spells
more
often
with
the
extra
mana
and
some
health
for
survivability.
This
can
then
build
offensively
into
an
early
Rod
of
Ages
or
a
more
defensive
Odyn's
Veil
.
Getting
a
Tear
of
the
Goddess
and
then
upgrading
it
into
an
Archangel's
Staff
will
greatly
increase
Cassiopeia's
ability
power,
as
well
as
solving
any
mana
problems
that
you
may
have.
It
is
also
quite
easy
to
gain
charges
with
the
low
cooldowns
on
her
spells,
as
well
as
constant
refreshing
of
her
passive.
Cassiopeia's
doesn't
necessarily
need
a
mana
fix,
thanks
to
her
passive
and
low
mana
costs.
However,
due
to
her
naturally
low
cooldowns
and
poke-heavy
style
of
play
in
lane,
she
can
easily
charge
Tear
of
the
Goddess
,
whose
ultimate
upgrade
Seraph's
Embrace
,
gives
Cassiopeia
more
AP
than
any
other
item
save
Rabadon's
Deathcap
and
Mejai's
Soulstealer
at
level
18,
as
well
as
a
nice
active.
The
AP
it
gives
will
be
even
greater
if
you
plan
to
build
other
mana
items
such
as
Rod
of
Ages
.
Avoid
building
cooldown
reduction
.
Because
Noxious
Blast's
damage
tick
is
constant
and
can
only
be
reapplied,
and
using
Twin
Fang
on
a
poisoned
enemy
reduces
the
cooldown
to
0.5
seconds
(which
cannot
be
further
reduced
by
CDR),
Cassiopeia
does
not
gain
the
significant
benefit
from
CDR
as
other
mages
do.
Therefore,
Rabadon's
Deathcap
will
be
the
major
purchase
for
when
you
want
more
damage
as
Cassiopeia
.

If
you
can
predict
when
Cassiopeia
will
use
Petrifying
Gaze
such
as
at
the
beginning
of
a
fight
or
at
the
end,
you
can
avoid
the
2
second
stun.
You
will
hear
Cassiopeia
gasp
before
she
activates
Petrifying
Gaze
(.65
casting
time),
so
you
have
a
brief
moment
to
react
to
Cassiopeia
.
Cassiopeia
relies
heavily
on
landing
Petrifying
Gaze
so
that
Miasma
and
Noxious
Blast
are
unavoidable.
When
dueling
her
she
will
put
Miasma
right
on
you,
despite
the
constant
damage
from
it
the
time
needed
to
move
out
will
let
her
spam
Twin
Fang
to
death.
It's
better
to
stay
in
the
venom
and
outburst
her.
Mages
with
strong
regenerative
abilities
like
Swain
,
Vladimir
,
or
Fiddlesticks
can
better
outlast
her
DoT
damage.
Even
with
her
passive,
avoiding
several
of
her
abilities
(better
said
Noxious
Blast
which
is
very
predictable)
will
quickly
lead
to
mana
problems.
Cassiopeia
lacks
a
powerful
instant
nuke
apart
from
Petrifying
Gaze
,
other
mages
who
can
nuke
potently
or
disabling
her
like
Malzahar
or
Xerath
can
effectively
counter
her
mid-late
game
Cassiopeia
has
excellent
range
on
Noxious
Blast
and
as
its
main
harassing
tool,
outranging
her
is
highly
beneficial,
mages
like
Lux
and
Brand
have
a
clear
advantage.
These
mages
can
also
outburst
her
if
done
correctly.
Cassiopeia
is
a
very
powerful
harasser.
Noxious
Blast
allows
her
to
give
her
lane
opponent
a
hard
time,
but
also
be
wary
for
Miasma
,
as
it
can
set
you
up
for
ganks,
make
landing
Noxious
Blast
or
especially
Twin
Fang
extremely
easy,
or
zone
you
from
minions
very
effectively.
Buying
Boots
of
Speed
is
a
good
and
cheap
way
to
limit
her
harassment.
Cassiopeia
is
extremely
proficient
at
1v1
fights,
having
the
most
sustained
damage
of
all
mages
(maybe
only
matched
by
Vladimir
).
Therefore
it
is
not
recommended
to
engage
her
alone.
Since
Cassiopeia
has
very
high
ability
power
scalings,
she
remains
a
constant
threat
to
AD
carries
late
game,
since
if
she
lands
her
ultimate,
she
can
easily
kill
an
AD
carry
without
resistances
within
the
2
second
stun
Petrifying
Gaze
provides
her.
Champions
who
can
outmatch
her
sustained
damage
but
also
survive
the
2
second
stun
like
Vladimir
,
Kayle
,
Elise
,
or
Swain
can
potentially
duel
and
kill
her.
Due
to
Noxious
Blast
and
Miasma
,
Cassiopeia
is
very
powerful
at
kiting.
If
she
gets
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
she
will
be
almost
impossible
to
reach
if
played
correctly;
do
not
engage
her
with
a
champion
without
strong
gap
closers
or
excellent
ranges
while
also
being
able
to
withstand
her
damage
in
a
1v1
fight.
Avoiding
her
Noxious
Blast
and
Miasma
is
critical
for
your
survival,
as
they
deal
heavy
DoT,
and
being
poisoned
allows
Cassiopeia
to
spam
her
Twin
Fang
on
you.
Also,
avoid
being
hit
by
the
poisons
of
other
champions:
Singed's
Poison
Trail
,
Teemo's
Toxic
Shot
/
Noxious
Trap
,
or
Twitch's
Deadly
Venom
which
will
also
allow
Cassiopeia
to
spam
her
Twin
Fang
.

Leona
Champion
Background
Strategy
Skins
&amp;
Trivia
Skill
usage
Leona
is
primarily
played
as
a
support
and
her
strength
as
a
champion
comes
from
her
incredible
amount
of
hard
CC
from
Shield
of
Daybreak
,
Zenith
Blade
,
and
Solar
Flare
,
the
team
damage
potential
from
Sunlight
,
and
her
natural
durability
from
her
stats
and
Eclipse
.
Maximize
Sunlight's
potential
by
timing
your
skills
in
a
way
that
gives
your
allies
an
opportunity
to
consume
each
mark.
Sunlight
can
be
activated
by
any
damage
so
long
as
she
is
not
the
source,
including
a
DoT
like
Despair
.
Shield
of
Daybreak
can
be
used
to
help
Leona
destroy
towers
or
get
last-hits
as
it
resets
her
attack
timer
and
deals
bonus
damage,
even
to
structures.
With
high
natural
CC,
Leona
can
set
up
kills
for
her
jungler
even
if
they
lack
it
themselves,
such
as
Shyvana
.
Zenith
Blade
can
be
relatively
easy
to
land
during
the
early
laning
phase
when
ADCs
do
not
have
very
much
attack
speed
and
thus
have
a
long
enough
attack
animation
to
close
in
on
them.
If
Leona
is
hit
by
a
knock-back
while
Zenith
Blade
is
in
flight,
she
will
be
knocked
back,
but
then
immediately
blink
to
the
last
enemy
hit
by
the
skill
even
though
she
has
been
knocked
farther
away.
Against
champions
with
knockbacks
or
blinks,
it
is
generally
better
to
save
Zenith
Blade
until
after
they
expend
their
distance-creating
ability
whenever
possible.
A
standard
combo
would
be
to
activate
Eclipse
at
a
distance
and
then
use
Zenith
Blade
to
dash
to
an
enemy
champion,
activating
Shield
of
Daybreak
in
mid-flight.
Leona
lanes
well
with
aggressive
teammates
with
powerful
early-game
harassment
skills
such
as
Graves
,
Tristana
and
Varus
,
however
many
ADCs
can
easily
take
advantage
of
her
kit.
When
unable
to
directly
communicate
with
a
lane-mate,
activating
Eclipse
can
be
a
good
signal
to
them
that
you
are
about
to
initiate
your
combo.
Likewise,
it
can
also
tell
your
enemies
that
you're
about
to
engage
on
them.
Be
quick
or
hide
in
the
brush
to
prevent
the
enemy
from
disengaging.
Solar
Flare
can
be
used
to
steal
Dragon
or
Baron
Nashor
from
significant
range.
However,
its
small
delay
and
low
damage
requires
good
timing.
Place
Solar
Flare
where
it
will
hit
as
many
enemies
as
possible,
not
only
for
the
stun
and
80%
slow,
but
also
to
maximize
Sunlight's
bonus
damage.
The
cooldown
on
the
ability
is
fairly
low,
so
don't
be
afraid
to
use
it
to
set
up
kills
or
to
save
teammates.
It
is
a
good
idea
to
prioritize
skill
points
into
Eclipse
.
It
deals
the
most
damage
of
any
of
your
skills,
and
has
the
most
significant
bonuses
upon
level-up.
It
is
important
to
get
a
point
in
Shield
of
Daybreak
early
to
complete
Leona's
combo,
but
extra
points
in
the
ability
aren't
particularly
noticeable.
Maxing
Zenith
Blade
after
Eclipse
is
the
best
way
to
help
Leona
overcome
her
lackluster
wave
clear,
enabling
her
to
kill
minion
waves
with
one
combo
by
level
9
.
Eclipse
does
not
need
to
be
taken
until
level
3
as
a
Zenith
Blade
and
Shield
of
Daybreak
combo
will
allow
you
to
exchange
harass
damage
against
enemy
lanes.
Zenith
Blade
can
be
used
even
against
enemies
you
cannot
see,
making
it
good
for
chasing
enemies
who
become
invisible
or
flee
into
brush
or
over
walls.
However,
Zenith
Blade
will
not
reveal
a
stealthed
enemy
so
you
will
not
be
able
to
follow
up
with
a
Shield
of
Daybreak
.
Eclipse
can
still
damage
them
however.
Spell
shields,
such
as
that
from
Banshee's
Veil
,
will
prevent
her
abilities
from
applying
Sunlight
,
but
they
will
not
stop
Zenith
Blade
from
pulling
Leona
to
her
target
or
prevent
Eclipse's
defense
bonus.
Aim
Zenith
Blade
so
that
the
desired
target
is
the
last
enemy
hit
by
the
skill.
Zenith
Blade
and
Eclipse
can
be
used
to
mark
minions
with
Sunlight
to
make
it
easier
for
your
lane
partner
to
last-hit
large
waves,
especially
if
they
have
AoE
skills.
Beware
when
casting
Zenith
Blade
near
enemy
towers;
you
can
be
pulled
under
it
and
take
aggro.
On
a
similar
note,
Zenith
Blade
can
potentially
put
you
in
a
bad
position
and
out
of
range
of
your
teammates.
Zenith
Blade's
projectile
does
have
a
travel
time,
so
it
is
generally
unwise
to
use
the
spell
at
the
tip
of
its
range
since
the
enemy
champion
has
time
to
dodge.
When
laning,
control
the
brush
whenever
possible
as
her
ability
to
set
up
kills
gives
her
excellent
zoning.
Using
Flash
while
Zenith
Blade
is
winding
up
can
result
in
the
range
of
the
ability
being
extended
and
harder
for
the
enemy
to
dodge.
If
Leona's
lane
partner
is
fed
enough,
and/or
they
are
able
to
handle
a
1
vs
2
lane,
she
can
begin
roaming
as
soon
as
she
purchases
movement
speed
and
a
gold
generating
item.
Her
massive
CC
allows
her
to
set
up
kills
easily,
especially
when
Solar
Flare
is
available.
When
coordinating
a
roaming
gank
with
your
team's
jungler,
Leona's
ganking
ability
is
more
potent.
Leona's
abilities
have
a
decent
amount
of
base
damage,
especially
Eclipse
.
Use
this
to
your
advantage
to
kill
fragile
characters
who
underestimate
your
burst
damage.
Leona
has
the
ability
to
clear
enemy
wards
just
after
their
placement.
Deal
a
basic
attack,
activate
Shield
of
Daybreak
for
another,
and
immediately
attack
again
to
kill
it.
Build
usage
Leona
can
be
built
in
multiple
ways
with
the
most
favorable
being
a
supportive
tank.
Less
common
builds
include
more
offense,
while
utilizing
her
natural
crowd
control
and
tankiness.
Tank
With
defensive
items,
Leona
can
be
very
hard
to
kill.
Armor,
magic
resist,
and
health
help
her
to
make
a
very
strong
front
line.
Leona
can
not
only
provide
initiation,
but
can
also
lock
down
targets
with
her
numerous
stuns
and
immobilizes
in
the
middle
of
the
fight.
Since
Eclipse
provides
Leona
a
high
amount
of
armor
and
magic
resist,
she
will
generally
gain
more
of
a
survivability
boost
from
building
health
as
opposed
to
more
armor
or
magic
resist,
although
the
bonus
does
scale
with
extra
defense.
The
Relic
Shield
or
Ancient
Coin
are
great
starting
choices
for
Leona
depending
on
how
you
want
to
play
her.
Relic
Shield
will
allow
her
to
help
sustain
herself
and
her
partner
during
the
laning
phase
and
builds
into
Face
of
the
Mountain
,
which
can
provide
a
decent
shield
and
possible
nuke
depending
on
who
you
use
the
active
on.
On
the
other
hand,
Talisman
of
Ascension's
active
will
allow
her
to
engage
easier
and
quicker
with
her
team.
The
choice
can
be
made
based
off
of
team
composition
and
the
needs
of
the
team.
The
more
team
related
items
that
Leona
favors
include
Locket
of
the
Iron
Solari
,
Sightstone
,
and
Talisman
of
Ascension
,
granting
herself
a
good
handful
of
stats
and
team
beneficial
actives.
If
you
have
Randuin's
Omen
,
try
to
use
its
active
ability
while
Eclipse
is
up
as
the
active
increases
in
duration
the
higher
your
armor
and
magic
resist.
At
max
rank,
Eclipse
by
itself
without
any
extra
defense
items,
provides
enough
to
increase
the
active's
duration
by
1.3
seconds.
Iceborn
Gauntlet
,
while
somewhat
expensive
and
uncommon,
will
allow
you
to
keep
targets
locked
down
for
much
longer
due
to
the
slowing
field
in
addition
to
providing
good
defensive
stats.
Though
you
won't
be
able
to
take
advantage
of
the
proc
as
frequently
as
other
champions,
the
utility
it
provides
may
be
just
enough.
Attack
Damage
Bruiser
Leona
has
very
high
base
defense
and
utility.
Using
the
right
build
and
combination
of
items,
she
can
dive
into
the
enemy
backline
and
be
a
major
threat
to
their
damage
dealers.
While
being
played
as
a
solo
laner
or
jungler,
she
can
use
this
build
to
accomplish
this.
The
best
choices
for
this
role
contain
a
mix
of
damage,
cooldown
reduction
and
some
defenses.
Without
a
lane
partner,
Shield
of
Daybreak
becomes
Leona's
primary
ability,
as
it
grants
an
attack
reset,
extra
damage
and
a
stun.
Shield
of
Daybreak
works
well
with
combo
related
items.
Sheen
,
Trinity
Force
and
Ravenous
Hydra
giving
Leona
some
extra
burst.
In
lane,
this
can
lead
to
very
strong
trades
-
Zenith
Blade
allows
you
to
close
the
gap,
using
an
auto
attack
for
the
extra
damage,
and
Shield
of
Daybreak
resetting
your
attack
timer
for
another
strike.
Be
aware
that
Shield
of
Daybreak
has
a
high
base
cooldown.
Knowing
how
to
pace
your
abilities
is
necessary
to
maximize
Sheen
procs.

Countering
In
lane,
Leona
will
attempt
a
combo
of
Eclipse
immediately
followed
by
Zenith
Blade
to
jump
to
you
and
Shield
of
Daybreak
to
stun
and
ensure
Eclipse's
damage.
This
combo
is
especially
dangerous
from
the
brush
-
keep
track
of
her.
Zenith
Blade
has
a
small
width
and
slightly
short
range
-
staying
back
or
side
stepping
can
help
you
dodge
it.
If
Leona
uses
Zenith
Blade
to
farm
minions,
it
can
sometimes
be
advantageous
to
make
it
hit
you
and
force
her
into
a
bad
position.
Stay
mobile
in
order
to
make
it
harder
for
her
to
effectively
initiate
with
Solar
Flare
and
her
combo.
Spread
out
to
minimize
how
many
people
will
be
hit
by
the
stun
from
Solar
Flare
,
and
possibly
the
entire
ability.
Catch
Leona
alone
whenever
possible,
as
she
cannot
make
use
of
Sunlight
without
a
teammate.
Any
damage
from
her
lane
partner
will
proc
Sunlight
,
notably
damage-over-time,
greatly
increasing
damage
taken.
Try
to
force
her
to
use
most
of
her
skills
before
her
teammate
can
activate
the
marks.
Leona
is
hard
to
finish
off
in
combat
due
to
the
bonus
defensive
stats
from
Eclipse
.
Only
commit
to
killing
her
if
you
are
sure
of
victory.
Leona's
largest
source
of
personal
damage
comes
from
Eclipse
,
which
also
provides
her
the
most
defense.
Try
to
keep
your
distance
from
her
when
you
see
her
activate
it.
It
is
difficult
to
disengage
from
Leona
,
but
if
you
can
dodge
another
Zenith
Blade
,
which
has
a
small
hit
area
and
a
notable
casting
time,
you
can
cripple
her
ability
to
chase.
Coupled
with
her
low
base
movement
speed,
it
is
possible
to
escape
from
her
by
simply
running
in
a
straight
line
away
from
her.
When
laning,
Leona
is
most
effective
when
she
can
surprise
her
foes
from
the
brush;
warding
your
lane's
brush
can
be
a
very
effective
way
to
diminish
her
zoning
ability.
Be
careful
about
using
knockback
abilities
such
as
Condemn
or
Buster
Shot
on
Leona
when
she
uses
Zenith
Blade
.
If
you
fire
before
Leona
starts
her
dash,
she
will
be
able
to
dash
to
the
last
enemy
champion
hit
regardless.
Instead,
try
to
time
the
shot
to
hit
just
as
she
starts
to
dash,
which
will
break
her
dash
and
knock
her
back,
effectively
canceling
her
gap
closer.
Remember
that
Zenith
Blade
places
Leona
behind
her
target
with
respect
to
her
point
of
view
on
using
Zenith
Blade
.
This
can
be
exploited
by
knockback
abilities
to
either
throw
her
into
one
of
your
turrets,
into
your
team,
or
to
Condemn
her
into
a
wall
with
proper
positioning.

Mirror
Image's
clone
acts
like
a
pet.
It
will
take
commands
similarly
to
Annie's
Summon:
Tibbers
.
It
is
wise
to
manually
control
it
for
the
means
of
confusing
the
opponent,
as
a
clone
heading
in
a
nonsensical
direction
after
being
summoned
clearly
betrays
the
real
LeBlanc
to
the
enemy.
Remember
to
use
ALT+RIGHT-CLICK
to
move
your
Mirror
Image's
clone.
Mirror
Image's
clone
is
a
champion
type
unit
and
therefore
can
also
be
hit
by
abilities
only
able
to
target
champions
such
as
Caitlyn's
Ace
in
the
Hole
.
Take
advantage
of
this
by
trying
to
encourage
your
enemies
to
use
their
powerful
champion
targeting
ultimates
on
your
clone
by
putting
yourself
out
of
sight
and
controlling
your
clone
like
she
were
the
original.
Keep
in
mind
that
your
clone's
auto-attacks
deal
no
damage
which
can
give
her
away
if
an
enemy
notices
this.
Distortion
provides
LeBlanc
with
a
deceptively
large
radius
of
threat.
Sigil
of
Silence
is
your
main
harassment
tool,
with
good
range
and
damage.
Distortion
is
an
effective
method
of
harassment,
as
re-casting
the
spell
will
cause
you
to
flash
back
to
your
casting
position,
giving
an
opportunity
to
deal
damage
with
minimal
risk
of
taking
significant
damage.
Combining
Sigil
of
Silence
and
Distortion
allows
you
to
deal
Sigil
of
Silence
's
proc
damage
as
well
as
silence
the
enemy
for
a
safe
retreat.
If
you
are
being
chased,
throw
Ethereal
Chains
on
the
pursuer
for
the
slow
and
potential
snare.
The
second
damaging
part
of
Ethereal
Chains
can
also
trigger
the
silence
from
Sigil
of
Silence
.
When
you
end
up
in
a
team
fight,
you
should
consider
utility
of
your
spells
over
damage,
and
consider
using
Ethereal
Chains
as
your
Mimic
spell
for
a
double
slow
and
longer
snare.
A
quick
way
to
cast
any
of
LeBlanc's
spells
is
to
smart-cast
them,
either
by
remapping
smart-cast
spells
to
Q
/
W
/
E
/
R
or
holding
shift
and
then
hitting
Q
/
W
/
E
/
R.
When
combined
with
the
combo
above
you
could
potentially
drop
an
enemy
carry
in
one
burst
before
they
have
time
to
react.
Ability
Combos
Activating
Sigil
of
Silence's
silence
mark
with
Ethereal
Chains
synergizes
perfectly
with
its
delayed
snare,
preventing
the
target
from
using
Flash
or
other
escape
mechanisms
for
more
than
3
seconds.
This
should
allow
yourself
or
your
team
to
secure
kills.
Chaining
Sigil
of
Silence
with
Mimic
can
provide
good
harassment
and
long
silence
periods
early-mid
game
and
can
shut
down
troublesome
casters
later
on.
By
selecting
a
target
to
cast
Sigil
of
Silence
on
while
out
of
range,
you
can
use
Distortion
to
close
the
gap,
and
then
use
it
again
to
return
to
safety.
Doing
this
can
extend
the
range
at
which
you
can
safely
harass
and
ward
enemy
champions
from
gold
or
experience.
Build
usage
While
it
may
seem
unintuitive,
Athene's
Unholy
Grail
is
actually
one
of
the
best
core
items
for
LeBlanc.
It
affords
her
some
cheap
magic
resist
to
increase
her
durability
in
lane,
virtually
eliminates
her
mana
problems,
and
most
importantly
it
provides
her
a
large
bonus
to
cooldown
reduction,
which,
because
of
her
high
base
damage,
drastically
increases
her
overall
damage.
Mejai's
Soulstealer
can
be
especially
powerful,
particularly
if
mid-laning.
Be
warned
that
due
to
her
already
snowbally
nature,
getting
killed
while
using
this
item
may
cause
her
to
fall
even
earlier
in
the
game
than
necessary.
It
is
worth
noting
that
getting
this
item
will
likely
make
the
enemy
team
redouble
their
efforts
to
shut
LeBlanc
down.
Given
that
she
is
already
a
priority
target
early
particularly
if
she
does
well,
getting
this
will
make
you
even
more
of
an
early-game
target
while
delaying
your
build
for
an
item
that
may
not
even
reach
gold
efficiency
if
you
are
focused
down.
Deathfire
Grasp
can
be
very
powerful
for
LeBlanc
as
it
covers
AP
and
an
additional
spell
in
her
combo
with
its
Active,
which
will
make
her
more
of
a
threat
in
the
later
stages
of
a
game.
Haunting
Guise
can
be
a
good
early
game
choice
for
LeBlanc
,
as
it
increases
durability
and
damage,
while
also
negating
early
game
Magic
Resistance.
It
can
also
replace
Sorcerer's
Shoes
in
many
builds,
allowing
the
use
of
other
boots
without
sacrificing
Magic
Penetration.
Two
Doran's
Ring
s
during
early
game
provides
cheap
and
highly
effective
stats.

Countering
Investing
in
an
early
Negatron
Cloak
for
magic
resistance
will
significantly
reduce
her
burst
damage.
Later
in
the
game,
you
can
build
it
into
a
Banshee's
Veil
and
disrupt
her
combo.
Otherwise,
if
you
are
playing
a
squishy
mage
or
AD
carry,
she
will
be
able
to
burst
you
down
even
late
game
due
to
good
scaling.
Do
NOT
neglect
MR.
LeBlanc
relies
heavily
on
spell
combos,
especially
with
her
Sigil
of
Silence
and
its
mimic.
Try
to
interrupt
her
spell
combo
in
the
middle
of
Sigil
of
Silence
,
as
this
will
often
force
her
back
to
wait
for
cooldown.
This
makes
Banshee's
Veil
particularly
effective
against
her
as
she
has
to
land
one
of
her
non-targeted
abilities
before
going
full
combo.
Be
sure
not
to
use
a
champion
who
relies
on
skillshots
or
delayed
AoE
damage
to
fight
her,
her
quadruple
moves
(with
both
Distortion
s)
can
make
her
untouchable
by
champions
such
as
Lux,
Xerath,
Diana,
Ziggs
or
Zyra.
Try
to
scare
LeBlanc
a
bit
to
force
her
to
use
her
dashes
prior
to
a
gank
,
as
the
long
cooldown
will
make
her
an
easy
target.
Mirror
Image
's
clone
does
not
carry
buffs-
use
this
to
identify
the
real
LeBlanc.
Always
wait
for
her
passive
to
trigger
before
targeting
her
with
an
ultimate
like
Garen's
Demacian
Justice
because
otherwise
she
will
most
likely
get
away
with
Distortion
.
LeBlanc
is
extremely
squishy
so
she
is
very
vulnerable
to
hard
cc
and
focus.
Taking
her
out
of
the
fight
early
prevents
her
from
being
able
to
burst
down
a
carry.
Mirror
Image
's
stealth
does
not
break
the
auto
attacking
AI's
lock
on
her;
allowing
the
autoattacking
AI
to
continue
without
interruption
can
finish
her
off.
LeBlanc
is
notorious
for
being
able
to
burst
down
AP
mid
laners.
However,
because
she
specializes
on
bursting
one
target,
having
your
jungler
gank
during
her
dives
will
cripple
her
aggression
significantly
and
cause
her
to
fall
off
prematurely.
Warding
brushes
will
make
it
harder
for
LeBlanc
to
juke
using
Distortion
.
LeBlanc
has
poor
farming
capabilities;
if
you're
unable
to
make
trades
safely,
then
simply
clear
minion
waves
quickly
to
force
her
back.

Skill
usage
Taric
's
passive
Gemcraft
allows
him
to
reduce
the
cooldown
of
his
abilities
by
two
seconds
every
time
he
attacks
after
using
a
spell
as
well
as
deal
additional
bonus
damage.
Try
to
weave
in
an
autoattack
after
every
spell
in
order
to
keep
spamming
your
abilities
quickly
in
succession
and
maximize
damage.
If
Taric
targets
himself
with
his
heal,
he'll
be
healed
for
140%.
Less
selfishly,
healing
an
ally
will
still
heal
Taric
for
100%
of
the
amount,
effectively
healing
for
200%.
You
can
use
the
active
of
Shatter
when
attempting
to
play
an
aggressive
early
game
or
to
last
hit
multiple
minions
at
once.
Shatter
is
also
very
useful
in
team
fights.
Use
the
area
of
effect
on
the
squishy
enemies
so
your
AD
carry
can
kill
them
faster
due
to
the
armor
reduction
.
Using
the
active
on
Shatter
will
remove
the
passive
bonus
armor
it
provides
(but
you
retain
the
passive
armor
aura).
Make
sure
not
to
use
it
when
being
ganked
or
chased,
as
the
loss
of
armor
will
make
you
easier
to
kill.
Taric
can
clear
minion
waves
really
fast
with
his
Shatter
and
Radiance
abilities.
Building
ability
power
early
game
and
maxing
out
Dazzle
can
lead
to
extremely
high
single-spell
burst
and
harass
at
level
9.
However,
this
strategy
has
its
drawbacks,
as
the
damage
from
Dazzle
will
not
be
substantial
late
game
and
requires
Taric
to
be
at
very
close
range
in
order
to
deal
the
full
damage.
Taric
should
usually
Dazzle
the
enemy
carry
in
a
team
fight
so
that
they
can
be
quickly
killed
by
your
team.
Taric's
Dazzle
is
difficult
to
see,
however,
so
if
there
is
more
than
one
potential
target,
it's
up
to
you
to
determine
which
enemy
to
stun,
usually
by
pinging
them.
When
coupled
with
Singed's
Fling
or
another
repositioning
ability,
this
can
provide
a
clear
advantage
in
a
team
fight.
Use
Radiance
during
pushes
or
team
fights
to
boost
the
damage
of
your
teammates,
but
be
careful
not
to
activate
it
too
early,
as
it
is
highly
visible,
so
enemy
champions
may
disengage
and
wait
out
the
10
seconds.
Pairing
Taric
and
another
pushing
hero
such
as
Sivir
together
can
make
a
very
effective
pushing
duo.
Due
to
his
slow
movement
speed
and
lack
of
any
real
escape/chase
mechanisms
(
Dazzle
has
a
long
cooldown
and
can
be
negated
by
such
things
as
Banshee's
Veil
,
Black
Shield
or
Spell
Shield
,
Cleanse
,
etc.),
Ghost
and
Flash
are
both
respectable
choices
for
Taric's
summoner
spells.
Early
game,
Taric
is
relatively
squishy.
Stay
clear
of
the
enemy
until
you
have
taken
Shatter
and/or
purchased
survivability
items.
Dazzle
used
before
or
after
another
guaranteed
stun/knockup
will
maximize
the
CC
duration,
allowing
for
a
potential
kill.
Taric
is
a
great
roamer
with
his
stun
Dazzle
allowing
his
team
to
set
up
ganks
and
stun-locking
a
target
if
your
ally
has
a
stun.
Taric
can
zone
very
well
with
his
Dazzle
and
by
letting
his
lane
partner
farm
while
zoning
the
enemy
off
by
sitting
in
the
bushes
at
bottom
lane.
Build
usage
A
popular
way
to
itemize
Taric
is
to
stack
auras
,
such
as
Aegis
of
the
Legion
,
Locket
of
the
Iron
Solari
,
or
Zeke's
Herald
to
synergize
with
his
ability
auras
from
Shatter
and
Radiance
.
Itemizing
Taric
with
Mercury's
Treads
provides
many
buffs
to
his
natural
deficiencies.
As
Taric's
base
armor
is
already
high
thanks
to
his
Shatter
,
Mercury's
Treads
is
a
good
item
to
grab
on
him
since
his
necessity
to
get
close
to
use
two
of
his
abilities
will
often
be
the
focus
target
in
team
fights.
The
magic
resistance
also
helps
him
as
his
magic
resistance
is
only
average.
When
playing
as
support,
is
useful
to
take
both
Frost
Queen's
Claim
and
Mikael's
Crucible
,
the
first
for
getting
gold
and
mana
regen
aura,
and
also
a
powerful
slow
that
combine
quite
well
with
initiating
a
team
fight,
the
latter
for
increased
mana
regen
and
magic
resist,
and
his
powerful
active
that
is
an
equivalent
Cleanse
and
Heal
.
These
two
items
are
very
useful
to
all
support
champions,
but
for
Taric
they
offer
a
bit
more,
due
to
his
skillset
(a
stun,
a
heal
and
an
aura
armor)
Cooldown
reduction
items
are
very
useful
for
Taric
,
because
your
Radiance
is
one
of
the
most
useful
auras
for
your
team,
granting
a
strong
AD
/
AP
bonus
to
your
entire
team
on
a
relatively
short
cooldown.
It
is
possible
to
build
Taric
as
an
AP
caster/burst
mage.
He
has
strong
AoE
damage
from
Shatter
and
that
can
follow
up
a
Dazzle
stun.
Build
mana
regeneration
and
cooldown
reduction
to
constantly
use
all
of
his
abilities.
Although
expensive,
both
Frozen
Heart
and
Iceborn
Gauntlet
are
very
useful
on
Taric
&amp;
to
his
team.
They
synergize
well
with
his
Shatter
Gemcraft
.
If
the
enemy
team
is
AD
heavy,
or
the
majority
of
their
damage
turns
out
to
be
physical
at
mid
game
(check
who
gets
fed
in
the
scoreboard),
consider
getting
a
Thornmail
instead
of
a
Aegis
of
the
Legion
or
Locket
of
the
Iron
Solari
.
It
will
be
more
efficient
at
providing
armor
(100
vs
30
vs
30)
for
basically
the
same
cost
as
Aegis,
and
Taric's
Shatter
will
provide
more
armor
than
either
Aegis
or
Runic
when
Taric
has
250
total
armor
(30/.12
=
250).
Taric's
lvl
18
armor
is
74,
and
combined
with
100
bonus
armor
and
30
passive
armor
bonus,
means
that
Taric
only
needs
44
armor
from
other
sources.
Usually
flat
armor
seals
and
Ninja
Tabi
handle
this
job
quite
well.
If
the
enemy
team
is
AP
heavy,
or
the
majority
of
their
damage
turns
out
to
be
magical
at
mid
game
(check
who
gets
fed
in
the
scoreboard),
consider
getting
a
Spirit
Visage
,
because
they
increase
your
self-healing
of
Imbue
(120%
to
168%
respectively)
and
reduces
the
cooldowns
of
all
abilities
by
10%.
However,
this
item
is
still
a
good
choice,
regardless
of
the
enemy
team.
Taric
can
also
go
solo
top
lane
as
an
AP/AD
bruiser,
focusing
on
building
large
amounts
of
armor,
magic
resistance,
mana,
and
health.
This
can
be
an
effective
couter
pick
to
AD
based
bruisers
and
assassins
such
as
Riven
,
Zed
,
and
Olaf
to
a
degree.
If
going
solo
top
items
such
as
Iceborn
Gauntlet
,
Frozen
Heart
,
and
Manamune
/
Archangel's
Staff
are
all
good
items
for
dueling
against
melee
bruisers
or
assassins,
while
Spirit
Visage
is
good
for
mitigating
magic
damage
and
improving
your
self
heal.
Jungling
Aside
from
his
classic
role
as
a
support,
Taric
is
also
a
jungler.
He
is
not
very
popular
as
a
jungler
and
it
may
take
your
enemies(and
allies)
off-guard.
Imbue
lets
him
keep
his
health
high.
Taric
can
cast
this
skill
often
as
basic
attacks
reduce
its
cooldown..
Shatter
aura
is
useful
for
beginner
junglers
and
people
lacking
jungle
runes
and
its
active
speeds
up
his
clear
time.
Dazzle
is
a
great
initiation
for
ganking
followed
by
Radiance
and
Shatter
.
At
later
ranks
with
some
CDR
its
cooldown
is
short
enough
to
be
used
a
second
time
during
a
single
gank.

Countering
Be
careful
not
to
over-commit
to
early
lane
fights
with
Taric
,
considering
he
is
one
of
the
few
champions
able
to
heal
himself
and
stun
the
opponent.
Taric
has
little
resistance
to
long
ranged
harassment.
Taric
is
naturally
strong
against
physical
damage
due
to
his
passive
Shatter
armor
bonus,
but
has
no
magic
damage
protection.
Use
this
as
an
advantage
when
possible.
Taric's
survivability
with
tanky
items
is
incredible
and
he
can
usually
absorb
damage
over
extended
periods
of
time
from
multiple
champions
in
order
to
bait
you
into
overextending
or
pursuing
him
into
the
jungle.
Don't
engage
him
without
information
on
his
allies'
positions.
When
playing
as
a
melee
carry,
targeting
Taric
can
usually
result
in
your
death
if
you
run
into
the
middle
of
his
team
or
chase
him
through
the
jungle
to
kill
him,
as
his
armor
aura
and
his
innate
ability
to
heal
himself
greatly
makes
him
a
difficult
1v1
kill.
Also,
when
fighting
him
1v1,
consider
that
his
abilities
reduce
the
cooldown
on
his
other
abilities.
It
is
possible
for
Taric
to
1v1
indefinitely
as
long
as
he
can
outheal
your
damage
(usually
due
to
having
high
resistances)
and
that
he
has
mana
to
sustain
his
abilities.
Cooldown
reduction
almost
isn't
necessary
due
to
his
new
passive.

Lulu
Champion
Background
Strategy
Skins
&amp;
Trivia
Skill
Usage
In
general,
Lulu
's
strength
comes
from
her
great
amount
of
CC
and
high
base
damage
for
a
support.
Pix,
Faerie
Companion
encourages
players
to
harass
with
auto-attacks
more
often
as
it
scales
quickly
and
becomes
an
excellent
form
of
harass.
Glitterlance
has
a
moderate
mana
cost
at
early
ranks.
Use
it
sparingly
to
poke,
as
it
can
quickly
drain
your
mana.
You
can
use
Help,
Pix!
on
allies,
enemies,
or
minions
in
order
to
greatly
extend
the
range
on
Glitterlance
and
make
an
unexpected
poke
at
an
enemy
champion.
However,
for
better
mana
efficiency,
auto-attack
a
few
times
before
casting
Help,
Pix!
on
an
enemy.
As
they
try
to
retaliate
or
escape,
use
Glitterlance
on
them
to
disengage
or
continue
the
attack.
As
a
support,
Lulu
works
best
with
attack
damage
carries
with
large
amount
of
poke
and/or
those
that
require
more
passive
playstyles
such
as
Caitlyn
,
Tristana
,
Kog'Maw
,
Varus
,
Ezreal
,
Twitch
,
and
Ashe
.
However,
Lulu
does
not
fair
well
with
attack
damage
carries
that
requires
early
game
aggression
such
as
Graves
,
Draven
,
and
Corki
.
Despite
Vayne
's
lack
of
poke,
Lulu
's
kit
synergizes
well
with
Vayne.
Vayne's
Night
Hunter
combined
with
Lulu's
Whimsy
greatly
increases
Vayne's
movement
speed
and
allows
her
to
chase
down
fleeing
enemies.
Her
Wild
Growth
can
catch
enemies
by
surprise
when
Vayne
exits
out
of
her
stealth
through
Final
Hour
and
extra
survivability.
Help,
Pix!
will
not
only
help
keep
Vayne
alive
with
a
shield,
but
adds
additional
DPS
with
Silver
Bolts
and
Pix,
Faerie
Companion
and
Lulu
can
continue
to
poke
using
Glitterlance
when
Pix
is
on
Vayne
even
if
Lulu
isn't
able
to
catch
up
with
Vayne
in
terms
of
movement
speed.
Always
be
careful
when
using
Whimsy
.
The
speed
boost
on
Whimsy
is
very
useful,
but
using
it
this
way
may
mean
that
it
won't
be
available
when
you
find
that
you
need
it
to
disable
a
high
burst
damage
enemy
such
as
Talon
,
or
Riven
,
or
to
interrupt
a
channel
such
as
Malzahar's
Nether
Grasp
or
Fiddlesticks's
Drain
.
Lulu
excels
at
supporting
initiation:
attach
Pix
to
a
tank,
then
Whimsy
them
to
allow
them
to
move
into
range
of
the
enemy
quickly
and
fire
off
a
Glitterlance
to
slow
much
of
the
enemy
team.
use
Wild
Growth
then
and
you
will
disable
the
entire
enemy
team
for
a
couple
of
seconds.
A
single
rank
Whimsy
makes
Lulu
quite
mobile,
allowing
for
ganks
or
wards
depending
on
her
build.
Use
Help,
Pix!
on
enemies
who
can
use
stealth
like
Akali
,
Vayne
or
Twitch
to
keep
them
revealed
and
sabotage
one
of
their
biggest
strengths.
Use
Help,
Pix!
on
high
attack
speed
allied
champions
such
as
Master
Yi
,
Fiora
,
or
Evelynn
as
they
will
trigger
your
passive
damage
more
often
and
since
they
are
squishy
most
of
time,
they
will
benefit
from
the
shield.
Wild
Growth
has
many
uses.
It
can
enhance
an
already
disruptive
tank
with
its
knockup
and
slow,
make
a
bruiser
virtually
impossible
to
peel
off
an
enemy
carry,
or
even
protect
a
carry
of
your
own.
In
lane,
it
can
make
ganks
from
champions
with
a
leap
or
dash
ability
more
potent,
or
to
help
escape
enemy
ganks.
In
general,
it
should
be
used
early
and
often
as
its
cooldown
is
far
shorter
than
most
ultimates.
If
timed
correctly,
Wild
Growth
can
be
used
to
interrupt
dashes
or
delay
escapes
long
enough
for
your
allies
to
finish
the
job.
Wild
Growth
does
not
grab
turret
or
minion
aggro
when
knocking
up
enemy
champions
as
it
does
not
do
damage.
Thus
it
can
be
safely
used
within
turret
range.
Wild
Growth
isn't
affected
by
healing
reduction
because
it
increases
health,
not
heals
it.
Wild
Growth
is
especially
useful
when
used
in
conjunction
with
Poppy's
Diplomatic
Immunity
,
as
it
solves
her
inability
to
stick
to
her
target.
Wild
Growth
synergizes
especially
well
with
AoE
ultimates,
trapping
enemy
champions
in
the
area
for
the
duration
such
as
Crowstorm
,
Soul
Shackles
,
and
Cannon
Barrage
.
In
particular,
Wild
Growth
synergizes
exceptionally
well
with
Yasuo
,
as
it
can
knock
up
several
enemies
in
a
large
area
for
him
to
use
Last
Breath
on,
along
with
a
cooldown
low
enough
to
use
it
again
in
another
fight.
Use
Whimsy
to
help
allies
escape
dangerous
situations.
Casting
Whimsy
on
them
or
on
the
enemy
will
make
for
an
easier
getaway.
Build
Usage
At
40%
cooldown,
you
can
constantly
keep
Help,
Pix!
on
an
ally.
Cooldown
reduction
in
general
is
exceptional
on
Lulu
as
it
allows
her
to
keep
constant
CC
on
enemies
in
teamfights.
Lulu
can
easily
support
other
champions
from
the
back,
making
aura
items
a
viable
choice.
Aegis
of
the
Legion
will
increase
the
effectiveness
of
Help,
Pix!
and
Wild
Growth
on
both
you
and
your
allies,
since
shields
&amp;
health
bonuses
are
able
to
soak
up
more
damage
with
higher
defenses.
Zeke's
Herald
gives
you
a
bit
of
health,
a
good
amount
of
Cooldown
Reduction
and
also
grants
your
AD
allies
bonus
attack
damage
and
life
steal.
As
an
AP
support,
Lulu
can
pick
up
Spellthief's
Edge
as
a
good
starting
item
since
her
kit
encourages
her
to
auto-attack.
Liandry's
Torment
makes
her
more
resilient,
boost
all
her
abilities,
and
has
great
synergy
with
her
massive
amount
of
CC,
making
it
a
good
first
damage
item.
Athene's
Unholy
Grail
immediately
after
(or
before)
Liandry's
Torment
gives
a
dramatic
boost
to
CDR
and
solves
her
mana
issues.
Other
options
include
Morellonomicon
and
Archangel's
Staff
,
if
you
are
looking
for
a
cheaper
alternative
or
more
AP
respectively.
Hextech
Gunblade
is
a
good
item
to
build
on
Lulu
as
it
has
spell
vamp
and
life
steal
to
keep
Lulu
alive
and
adds
extra
boost
with
her
autoattacks
thanks
to
Pix,
Faerie
Companion
.
If
you
have
more
than
one
AP
champions
in
your
team,
it
doesn't
hurt
to
build
a
Deathfire
Grasp
as
it
not
only
amplify
Lulu's
magic
damage,
but
your
entire
team's
damage
as
well.
A
Rabadon's
Deathcap
will
greatly
increase
the
potency
of
not
only
Lulu
's
damage,
but
also
her
utility,
particularly
the
speed
boost
from
Whimsy
.
Due
to
her
low
cooldowns
in
her
kit,
Spellblade
items
like
Lich
Bane
,
Trinity
Force
,
and
Iceborn
Gauntlet
adds
a
lot
of
damage
in
her
kit
and
autoattacks.
Since
Pix,
Faerie
Companion
adds
damage
to
basic
attacks,
Lulu
can
also
be
built
as
an
on-hit
attack
speed
carry
like
Teemo
,
Kog'Maw
,
Kayle
or
Jax
.
Typical
items
include
Blade
of
the
Ruined
King
,
Wit's
End
,
Nashor's
Tooth
,
Guinsoo's
Rageblade
,
Statikk
Shiv
,
and
Runaan's
Hurricane
,
since
they
give
you
Attack
Speed
to
trigger
Pix,
Faerie
Companion
more
often
as
well
as
several
on-hit
effects
to
increase
her
damage.
On-hit
items
such
as
Frozen
Mallet
and
Spirit
of
the
Elder
Lizard
and
Spellblade
items
like
Iceborn
Gauntlet
and
Trinity
Force
are
sometimes
built.
This
build
is
sometimes
called
&quot;Machine
Gun
Lulu&quot;
build
is
often
seen
played
top
lane,
mid
lane,
or
bottom
lane
ADC
Lulu.
While
interesting
to
some,
this
build
is
sub-optimal
as
Lulu
was
created
with
a
kit
to
support
rather
than
to
be
a
damage
carry.
A
potential
use
of
this
build
would
be
if
your
team
has
a
substantial
lead
or
is
lacking
a
proper
carry,
such
as
ARAMs.
On
the
other
hand,
mixing
AP
with
attack
speed
and
on-hit
items
adds
a
lot
of
damage
per
second
and
utility
in
her
kit
in
conjunction
to
Pix,
Faerie
Companion
will
max
the
fullest
potential
in
her
kit.
Be
sure
to
mix
and
match
attack
speed
and
AP
when
appropriate,
prioritizing
with
AP
first.
Runaan's
Hurricane
does
not
allow
Pix,
Faerie
Companion
to
strike
multiple
enemies
whether
Lulu
or
the
target
of
Help,
Pix!
has
it.

Countering
Mercury's
Treads
reduces
both
the
duration
of
her
disables,
as
well
as
her
damage
output,
making
it
an
ideal
item.
Lulu
does
not
have
a
very
high
natural
damage
output,
so
when
alone
or
focused,
she'll
die
quickly
without
much
retaliation.
However,
Lulu
has
a
much
higher
damage
output
than
most
other
support
champions
along
with
her
terrifying
amount
of
CC.
Don't
ignore
her
in
team
fights.
Despite
Lulu
's
strong
crowd
control,
poke,
and
peeling
power,
she
does
not
have
any
form
of
heals
to
keep
the
AD
carry
healthy
except
for
her
ultimate,
and
her
abilities
are
mana
intensive.
Therefore,
support
champions
with
healing
like
Sona
,
Soraka
,
and
Nami
can
stay
in
lane
longer.
Lulu
's
true
power
comes
from
the
CC
she
can
apply,
and
as
such,
is
extremely
dependent
on
her
teammates;
her
damage
doesn't
scale
well
into
the
late
game,
due
to
her
medium
ratios,
but
remains
a
powerful
disabler.
By
late
game
Whimsy
can
give
a
very
high
speed
boost
depending
on
her
build,
and
can
be
used
quite
often
in
conjunction
with
CDR.
Beware
if
she
uses
it
on
a
power
initiator
as
it
could
mean
an
easy
engagement.
In
lane,
Lulu
will
often
harass
heavily
with
her
Glitterlance
and
her
passive.
Unlike
many
piercing
skillshots,
standing
behind
minions
will
not
mitigate
the
damage,
so
moving
erratically
can
help
mitigate
damage
taken.
Lulu
has
no
consistent
heal,
so
poking
at
her
or
her
lane
partner
will
whittle
down
their
health
or
waste
her
mana
trying
to
shield
them.
Lulu
has
mediocre
auto-attack
damage
(44.
4
)
as
her
passive
gives
her
more
damage
on
attacks
and
it
quickly
scales
as
she
levels
up.
Do
not
be
afraid
to
exchange
auto-attacks
early
with
Lulu
as
champions
often
have
more
magic
resist
than
armor
early
on.
(Pix
will
barely
deal
about
5.
5
damage
at
level
one)
Be
wary
that
Pix
will
become
a
threat
if
Lulu
has
built
a
lot
of
attack
speed.
The
damage
scales
quickly,
and
getting
hit
by
all
three
bolts
lets
her
outdamage
carries
during
the
laning
phase.
By
level
17
Pix
adds
up
to
105
magic
damage
per
auto
(not
accounting
for
AP),
and
becomes
even
deadlier
when
used
on
a
carry
with
higher
attack
speed.
By
this
time
champions
don't
have
much
magic
resist
unless
they
have
itemized
for
it,
making
it
deceptively
powerful.
Wait
for
Lulu
to
use
Whimsy
before
trying
to
use
any
channeled
abilities
or
heading
into
the
fight.
This
leaves
her
without
the
polymorph
or
speed
buff,
and
allows
your
team
to
fight
without
disruption.
It
has
a
fairly
high
cooldown,
especially
at
earlier
ranks,
meaning
you
have
a
good
amount
of
time
to
fight
before
Lulu
can
use
it
again.
Lulu
is
deadly
for
ganks
as
a
combination
of
Glitterlance
,
Whimsy
and
Wild
Growth
will
leave
you
in
an
extremely
crippled
condition.
When
she
and
her
lane
partner
hit
level
6
it
can
be
very
hard
to
beat
them
in
a
2v2
situation
as
Wild
Growth
delivers
a
devastating
disable
and
heals
her
target
for
a
significant
amount.
Like
many
ultimates
on
supports,
Wild
Growth
has
a
somewhat
high
mana
cost
and
can
be
rendered
unusable
if
you
manage
to
harass
her
into
draining
her
mana
pool.
Lulu
is
an
excellent
baiter
due
to
Wild
Growth
;
be
very
careful
about
diving
or
committing
to
kill
her
if
she
has
the
ability
up.
Watch
out
for
Help,
Pix!
as
Glitterlance's
's
second
bolt
will
fire
from
Pix's
position,
meaning
that
Lulu
can
pick
up
an
unexpected
kill
on
you
or
a
nearby
ally
if
she
tags
you
or
a
nearby
champion/minion
with
it.
Despite
Lulu
being
squishy,
she
is
extremely
hard
to
catch,
being
able
to
escape
with
Whimsy
,
slow
you
with
Glitterlance
,
prevent
some
damage
with
Help,
Pix!
and
if
you
get
too
close
she
will
send
you
flying
with
Wild
Growth
while
the
slowing
field
will
keep
you
from
catching
up.
Try
to
get
Lulu
to
waste
her
ultimate
without
her
team
initiating.
If
Lulu
uses
Wild
Growth
in
conjunction
with
a
great
initiating
champion
such
as
Malphite
or
Maokai
,
your
team
will
be
locked
up
for
a
few
seconds.
If
she
does
use
it,
be
careful
of
what
you
do
next.
While
the
knock
up,
health,
and
slow
are
disruptive,
they
don't
hurt
your
team
much
after
the
initial
knock
up,
so
staying
and
fighting
may
be
a
good
option
if
you
can
take
out
the
champion
before
Lulu
can
shield
them
or
give
them
the
ability
power
and
speed
buff
from
Whimsy
.
If
you
have
to
run,
beware
of
the
slows
from
Wild
Growth
and
Glitterlance
.
If
you
get
slowed
by
both
of
them,
a
polymorph
from
Whimsy
may
take
you
out
if
Lulu's
team
is
nearby.
Also
keep
in
mind
that
Help,
Pix!
extends
Glitterlance's
range,
making
it
a
very
effective
chasing
tool
if
she
attaches
it
to
you
or
a
nearby
champion/minion.
Finally,
remember
that
Help,
Pix!
reveals
a
tagged
enemy
champion
until
Pix
leaves,
making
it
impossible
to
juke
through
bushes
or
past
corners
for
the
duration
of
the
debuff.
Lulu
is
one
of
the
few
champions
that
has
strong
flexibility
in
her
item
builds
and
kit
in
a
similar
vein
like
Kennen
and
Teemo
.
Pay
attention
to
her
build
and
build
accordingly
to
counter
her.
For
example,
if
she
goes
for
a
&quot;machine
gun&quot;
type
build
where
she
builds
a
lot
of
attack
speed
and
on-hit
items
with
the
use
of
Pix,
Faerie
Companion
,
consider
building
Randuin's
Omen
and
Frozen
Heart
to
counter
her
damage
per
second.
On
the
other,
pay
attention
to
which
lane
Lulu
can
go.
While
she's
normally
played
as
a
bottom
lane
support,
she
can
also
easily
played
as
an
ADC
due
to
her
Pix,
Faerie
Companion
;
and
she
can
easily
go
top
and
middle
lane
due
to
her
crowd
control
and
poking
kit
in
addition
to
Wild
Growth
and
Whimsy
's
speed
boost
makes
it
incredibly
difficult
for
melee
bruisers
and
assassins
to
kill
her
effectively.
Consider
playing
sustain
based
champions
like
Nidalee
,
Yorick
,
and
Vladimir
instead
to
counteract
her
crowd
control
and
poke.
