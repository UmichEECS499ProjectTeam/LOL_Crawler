Champions
generally
fall
into
certain
categories
based
on
their
skills.
These
are

and
are
used
on

on

page

Categories
Standard
tags
Those
categories
are
copied
exactly
from
the
game
client,
and
will
be
listed
on
each
champion
normal
page.
Note
that
some
champions
are
capable
of
more
than
just
the
role
or
roles
they
are
listed
under.
A
champion's
abilities,
items
they
gain
throughout
the
game,
and
one's
ability
to
fulfill
that
duty
determine
what
role
they
assume
in
gameplay.
As
of
V3.10
,
tags
for
secondary
attributes
are
no
longer
visible
in
the
game
client,
but
have
been
retained
here
for
information
purposes.
Primary
Attributes
Assassin
:
Champions
with
mediocre
auto-attacks
and
defense,
who
specialize
in
killing
their
enemies
quickly.
These
champions
usually
are
physical
attackers
and
are
DPS-based
(Damage
per
second)
or
are
AP
(ability
power)
burst
oriented.
Many
of
them
have
some
form
of
invisibility
or
blinking
ability
which
lets
them
choose
the
right
moment
to
step
in
or
out
of
a
fight.
They
should
focus
on
items
that
will
increase
the
damage
they
put
out
over
a
short
period
of
time.
In
fights,
they
play
a
role
as
sneak
attackers
of
key
targets
(like
the
marksman
or
the
mage),
who
pick
off
weak
enemies
and
carry
champions
at
the
right
time.
They
should
not
be
played
for
frontal
engagements
in
team
fights
since
they
lack
good
defense
compared
to
fighters
and
tanks.
Assassins
focus
on
timing
and
positioning,
rather
than
brute
strength
or
defense,
to
ensure
their
kills.
Assassins
usually
kill
marksmen,
supports,
and
most
mages
with
ease,
but
perform
worse
against
fighters
and
tanks.
Fighter
(also
known
as
Bruiser
or
Off-tank
):
Champions
that
blend
the
attributes
of
a
damager
and
tank,
combining
moderate
to
heavy
survivability
with
a
portion
of
the
damage
of
an
assassin
or
marksman
(essentially
half
tank,
half
DPS).
They
lack
the
front-loaded,
destructive
damage
of
their
pure
DPS
counterparts,
but
usually
have
abilities
which
increase
their
damage
output
or
abilities
with
high
damage
bases,
making
them
deadlier
in
the
early
game.
Fighters
can
build
to
be
extremely
survivable,
but
the
key
distinction
between
tanky
fighters
and
true
tanks
is
that
tanks
are
designed
to
draw
damage
and
disrupt
enemies,
while
fighters
deal
damage.
In
a
team
fight,
fighter
champions
can
surrogate
the
role
of
a
tank
or
assassin,
and
many
have
powerful
fight-initiation
abilities.
With
their
special
blend
of
defense,
damage,
and
mobility,
fighters
can
pierce
through
enemy
lines
to
reach
and
destroy
squishier
targets
while
withstanding
moderate
damage.
Fighters
can
usually
take
1v1
almost
any
other
role,
however
their
weakness
is
that
they
can't
dish
out
damage
as
reliably
as
a
marksman
or
as
quickly
as
a
mage
or
help
as
support;
usually,
their
role
in
late-game
is
more
to
defend
or
back
up
the
primary
damage
dealers
in
a
team
fight.
Most
fighters
fall
off
in
late
game
due
to
their
abilities
having
low
scaling
ratios
(but
very
high
bases).
Mage
:
(also
known
as
APC
:
Ability
Power
Carry
)
Mostly
ranged
champions
with
powerful
magic
damage
skills,
good
crowd
control
or
a
combination
of
both,
but
low
defense
and
weak
auto-attacks.
Some
are
meant
to
deal
a
high
amount
of
damage
in
a
short
period
of
time
(burst
casters/burst
mages)
while
others
usually
deal
damage
over
time;
however,
even
DoT
mages
tend
to
have
at
least
one
nuke.
Most
mages
present
the
user
with
a
flexible,
versatile,
and
powerful
skillset.
Like
marksman
champions,
they
can
bring
their
team
to
victory
due
to
their
ability
power
,
but
burst
based
mages
tend
to
fall
of
a
bit
at
late
game.
They
require
tanky
teammates
for
protection
since
they
lack
high
durability
as
they
are
capable
of
dishing
out
tremendous
damage
to
the
enemy
team
with
their
abilities.
Otherwise,
enemy
teams
can
easily
pick
them
off,
especially
since
few
mages
have
outstanding
mobility.
Mage
champions
easily
kill
marksmen,
other
mages
and
supports
(assasins
too,
but
they
have
to
get
caught
out
of
position
or
by
surprise),
and
a
few
mages
with
supreme
bursts
can
even
kill
fighters
1v1,
however,
the
large
majority
of
mages
can't
hit
hard
enough
to
kill
a
fighter
and
those
who
can
have
to
channel
a
combo(
Malzahar
)
or
take
a
while
to
fully
execute
their
skills
(
Syndra
,
Xerath
)
Some
mages
work
more
like
marksmen,
having
high
sustained
damage
rather
than
the
&quot;burst&quot;,
normally
associated
with
mages;
this
trait
allows
them
to
take
on
tanks
and
fighters
more
effectively,
though
mages
with
this
trait
are
less
effective
against
quick
damage
dealers
like
assassins.
Some
mages
have
abilities
with
high
base
damage,
and
if
they
are
doing
well,
they
can
get
somewhat
tankier
or
supportive
without
sacrificing
much
damage.
Range
between
mages
is
very
defining;
low
ranged
mages
have
to
build
tanky
ability
power
items,
otherwise
they
would
die
as
soon
as
they
enter
their
damage
range.
The
short
range
comes
with
rewards
however,
higher-than
usual
damage
(either
sustained
or
up-front
but
extremely
high)
(
Cassiopeia
,
Swain
,
LeBlanc
,
or
Vladimir
),
outstanding
crowd
control
(
Lissandra
)
or
naturally
increased
tankyness
and
survivality
(
Swain
,
or
Vladimir
).
The
long
ranged
ones
on
the
other
hand,
can
freely
build
&quot;glass
cannon&quot;
as
they
have
either
extremely
long
range
(
Xerath
)
or
are
very
hard
to
catch
or
kill
(
Lux
,
or
Nidalee
).
Marksman
:
(also
Known
as
ADC
:
Attack
Damage
Carry
or
just
Carry
)
Champions
with
high
auto-attack
damage,
usually
long
range,
but
low
defense.
Most
marksmen
have
skills,
passive
or
active,
that
scales
with
their
stats,
such
as
an
increase
in
Base
Damage
and
Attack
Speed
or
allowing
them
to
keep
themself
safe,
and
rely
on
their
auto-attack
to
dish
out
damage.
Marksman
champions
are
extremely
effective
late-game
at
&quot;carrying&quot;
the
team
to
victory,
either
by
killing
off
key
players
on
the
enemy
team
or
dealing
large
damage
in
team
fights
because
they
have
tremendous
damage
output,
but
low
defense.
Due
to
this,
they
are
key
champions
and
are
primary
targets
for
enemy
team
.
As
a
result,
they
require
tanky
teammates
like
fighters
and
tanks
for
protection
as
they
lack
survivability.
Some
marksmen
function
more
like
ranged
AD
casters
that
are
more
dependent
on
casting
skills
that
deal
high
amounts
of
burst
damage
than
autoattacking
(
Ezreal
,
Miss
Fortune
,
and
Graves
).
Other
marksmen
are
more
reliant
on
autoattacking
and
more
focused
on
building
attack
speed
,
Critical
chance,
items
that
boosts
their
autoattacks
(i.e.
Blade
of
the
Ruined
King
),
and
life
steal
instead
for
damage
per
second
(
Tristana
,
Vayne
,
and
Kog'Maw
)
Marksmen
can
only
usually
beat
supports
and
tanks
1v1
but
kill
everything
if
they
are
protected.
Due
to
their
low
health
marksmen
are
almost
always
beaten
by
the
high
burst
that
Mages
output.
Due
to
(most)
marksmen
not
being
all
too
reliant
on
abilities,
rather
using
autoattacks
to
deal
damage,
they
are
capable
of
dealing
a
lot
of
damage
over
a
longer
period
of
time
compared
to
mages.
Support
:
Champions
whose
skills
are
meant
to
directly
aid
the
rest
of
the
team.
They
can
either
babysit
a
champion
to
make
laning
easier
for
them
by
providing
healing,
buffing
allies,
applying
debuffs
to
the
enemy
team,
or
a
combination
of
the
above.
The
most
common
ability
for
a
support
champion
is
providing
an
ally
with
a
shield
of
some
kind
or
annoying
the
enemy
with
some
form
of
strong
crowd
control.
One
of
the
main
goals
of
a
support
is
to
let
their
lane
partner
farm
minions
for
gold,
as
supports
can
buy
key
gold+
items
to
get
gold
for
themselves,
as
well
as
controlling
the
map
with
wards,
warding
all
key
areas
of
the
map.
These
champions
usually
rely
on
their
skills
more
than
their
auto-attack.
Supports
can't
really
kill
anything
but
other
supports
on
their
own,
but
their
buffs
and
harsh
CC
makes
them
deadly
when
paired
along
with
any
other
role
but
tanks.
A
few
supports
have
ability
power
ratios
high
enough
to
let
them
become
mages,
and
a
few
mages
have
supportive
abilities/aggressive
crowd
control
which
lets
them
become
supports.
Supports
can
often
use
their
CC
to
interrupt
assassins
and
protect
nearby
mages
and
marksmen.
Tank
:
Champions
with
extremely
high
defense,
health,
and
crowd
control
abilities,
but
low
attack
damage
or
poor
ability
power
scaling.
Tanks
are
usually
champions
that
combine
high
amounts
of
health,
armor,
and
magic
resistance.
If
left
alone,
tanks
are
able
to
absorb
high
amounts
of
damage
or
create
disables
on
their
foes,
which
make
them
great
harassers
as
well.
In
battle,
this
type
of
champion
is
usually
expected
to
start/initiate
(or
at
least
be
in
the
front
of)
the
team
fight
;
soaking
up
damage,
and
helping
focus
certain
enemies
(marksman
and
mage
champions).
Due
to
their
low
damage
output,
they
must
rely
on
their
assassin,
marksman,
fighter,
and
mage
champions
to
finish
the
enemy
off
or
chase
them
down
when
they
initially
weakened
them.
As
a
result,
tanks
are
not
expected
to
gain
high
kills
but
more
assists.
Tank
champions
should
coordinate
team
fights
by
telling
the
team
to
retreat
or
advance
when
necessary
since
they
lead
the
charge.
They
are
also
meant
to
be
a
protector
of
the
team,
and
must
be
willing
to
sacrifice
themselves
for
vulnerable
allies
if
necessary.
Tanks
can
usually
kill
mages,
as
a
mage's
full
burst
will
rarely
take
the
tank
below
50%
health,
and
are
left
open
for
the
tank's
slow,
steady
damage
output;
however,
DoT
mages
might
be
harder
to
deal
with.
Some
tanks
have
very
high
ratios
on
their
abilities
and
if
they
are
doing
well
enough
they
can
leave
a
bit
their
tankiness
to
get
damage.
In
a
manner
similar
to
many
supports,
most
tanks
can
use
CC
to
interrupt
assasins,
but
they
can
also
use
them
to
lock
down
mages
or
marksmen
using
their
defenses
to
be
able
to
safely
position
themselves
within
the
enemy
lines.
Secondary
Attributes
Jungler
:
Champions
that
can
easily
farm
monsters
in
the
jungle
at
an
early
stage
in
the
game
and
can
typically
take
out
minions
waves
quickly.
They
usually
excel
at
taking
down
opponents
when
they
can
catch
them
off
guard
in
lane.
Some
champions
jungle
because
their
lane
phase
isn't
that
strong
(easily
harassed,
high
mana
dependency
early
on)
and
others
are
capable
of
both.
Many
fighters,
assassins
and
tanks
can
take
the
role
of
jungler;
though
it
is
generally
expected
that
the
champion
will
have
some
form
of
self
sustain
.
Melee
:
Champions
that
have
a
melee
basic
attack,
so
they
have
to
be
very
close
to
their
target
in
order
to
do
damage.
They
usually
have
more
health,
armor
and
magic
resistance
than
ranged
champions
as
well
as
heals.
Most
tanks
and
fighters
are
melee
combatants,
although
melee
mages
are
not
uncommon.
Pusher
:
Champions
that
can
quickly
kill
minion
waves
or
destroy
turrets
in
a
short
amount
of
time.
Typically,
pusher
champions
have
pets,
AoE
abilities,
or
a
high
amount
of
attack
speed.
Ranged
:
Champions
whose
basic
attack
can
cause
damage
at
a
distance
(see
range
),
allowing
them
to
avoid
many
harmful
risks
and
increasing
their
flee
capability.
Ranged
Champions
are
divided
into
two
sub-categories:
Mage
and
Marksmen
champions.
Mages
have
a
weak
auto-attack
and
focus
on
high
damage
spells
or
support,
while
marksmen
tend
to
focus
more
on
frequent,
powerful
auto-attacks.
Recommended
:
Champions
whose
skills
don't
involve
any
complicated
mechanics
and
playing
them
effectively
does
not
require
extensive
knowledge
of
the
other
champions.
They
are
all
1350
or
lower,
with
the
exception
of
Sona
,
Rammus
and
Katarina
,
who
cost
3150
.
There
is
usually
at
least
1
recommended
champion
every
free
week.
Stealth
:
Champions
that
possess
at
least
one
ability
that
allows
them
to
become
invisible
to
enemies
(other
than
when
near
turrets
and
vision
wards).
This
attribute
is
mainly
for
assassin
champions.

   On September 26th, 2011 Riot released a new map that brought a refreshing twist to the MOBA genre, Dominion. Less than a month after its release, DominateDominion.com was founded by TheFeedski; an avid Dominion player and supporter. With the intention to search for others that took the map seriously, it began primarily as a forum for easy communication. Once the community matured and established the current meta, we formed the belief that there is spot in Esports for Dominion. We added a guide section so players could share their successful builds, a live stream section so others could watch Dominion and learn how it's played, and are now currently hosting the only weekly Dominion tournaments in North-America. The games are shoutcasted and streamed every week, and the best part is, it's free to enter! We are constantly adding new features and aim to provide Dominion players with the best resources and knowledge to dominate Dominion.

       There are those sorcerers who give themselves over to the primal powers of nature, forgoing the learned practice of magic. Such a sorceress is Janna, who first learned magic as an orphan growing up amidst the chaos that is the city-state of Zaun. Janna eked out what living she could on the streets. Life was tough and dangerous for the beautiful young girl, and she survived by her wits, and by stealing when wits weren't enough. The rampant magic that characterizes Zaun was the first and most alluring tool which Janna realized could both protect and elevate her. Janna discovered that she had an affinity for a particular type of magic - the elemental magic of air. She mastered her studies of air magic in a matter of months, almost as if she was born of it. Janna went from a street vagrant to an avatar of the air virtually overnight, stunning and surpassing those who taught her. Such a rapid ascension also changed her physical appearance, giving her an otherworldly look. Seeking to right the injustice in the world (particularly the insanity that has become the city of Zaun), Janna has brought her talents to the League. She is a voice for the regulation of magical experimentation and a supporter of the development of techmaturgy, making her an indirect ally of the city-state of Piltover and the amazing techmaturgical minds that live there. Janna is also a new favorite of the League's many fans. She is often the center of attention at functions, fan appreciation days, and other celebratory events. There is something untouchable about Janna, however, and her affections can change as quickly as the wind. Do not be captivated by Janna's beauty. Like the wind, she is one gust away from terrible destruction.

Swain
Seizes
Power
in
Noxus
Master
Tactician
named
Grand
General
after
defeating
Keiran
Darkwill
Kaldera
Carnadine
reporting
from
Noxus
Katarina
and
Talon
arrive
in
Noxus
to
witness
Swain's
coronation
as
Grand
General.
Jericho
Swain
defeated
Keiran
Darkwill
in
a
duel
contesting
the
leadership
of
Noxus
last
night,
winning
the
support
of
High
Command.
Despite
rumors
of
involvement
with
the
Institute
of
War's
scandal
in
Kalamanda
,
Swain
has
been
named
Grand
General

the
highest
position
in
Noxus.
High
Command
remained
divided
in
support
between
the
two
men
since
Swain
returned
earlier
this
month.
Keiran
Darkwill
challenged
Swain
to
a
duel
to
settle
the
dispute,
claiming
that
such
a
standstill
was
a
&quot;cowards
game.&quot;
Many
members
of
High
Command
believed
this
to
be
a
strong
move
and
expected
Keiran,
a
notoriously
skilled
duelist,
to
win.
Onlookers
reported
that
Keiran
initially
had
the
upper
hand
and
gradually
forced
Swain
into
a
corner.
&quot;He
had
the
Master
Tactician
against
the
wall,&quot;
stated
one
witness.
&quot;I
heard
him
say
'watch
closely,'
and
he
vanished

then
reappeared
behind
Keiran.
Swain
dragged
him
to
the
ground
and
locked
the
poor
fool
in
his
snare
spell.&quot;
With
Keiran
immobilized,
Swain
called
General
Darius
,
his
most
prominent
supporter,
to
his
side.
&quot;Swain
declared
victory
and
left
Darius
to
evaluate
the
strength
of
Keiran
Darkwill,&quot;
explained
Chancellor
Malek
Hawkmoon.
&quot;That
didnt
take
Darius
long.
Without
a
word,
he
raised
his
axe

and
removed
Darkwills
head.&quot;
The
gathered
members
of
High
Command
unanimously
agreed
to
swear
loyalty
to
the
Master
Tactician.
With
none
remaining
to
protest
his
claim,
High
Command
named
Jericho
Swain
the
Grand
General
of
Noxus.
&quot;It
was
the
finest
demonstration
of
power
I
have
ever
witnessed,&quot;
stated
Chancellor
Malek
Hawkmoon.
&quot;Swain
rose
to
the
challenge
of
his
opponent,
used
his
wit
and
cunning
to
best
him,
and
demonstrated
his
ability
to
command.
Noxus
under
Jericho
Swain's
rule
shall
be
powerful
indeed.&quot;
While
High
Command
has
embraced
his
rule,
Swains
leadership
remains
controversial
in
Noxus's
lower
houses.
Some
accuse
Swain
of
willing
participation
in
Heywan
Relivashs
scheme
to
obtain
Kalamanda.
Katarina,
the
Sinister
Blade
herself,
commented:
&quot;He
gave
Kalamanda
to
the
League
in
exchange
for
power
in
Noxus.
A
bold
move.
A
strong
move.
The
strong
may
rise
to
power
here,
but
this
wouldnt
be
Noxus
if
there
werent
always
others
with
the
strength
to
challenge
them.&quot;
Heywan
Relivash
and
Ralston
Farnsley
Arrested
High
Councilor
and
Journal
of
Justice
Senior
Editor
Implicated
in
Conspiracy
Quinton
Groat
reporting
from
the
Institute
of
War.
Authorities
arrested
Heywan
Relivash
earlier
this
week
after
an
investigation
of
his
residence
revealed
his
involvement
in
the
Kalamanda
scandal.
The
uncovered
evidence
also
implicated
Ralston
Farnsley,
the
senior
editor
of
the
Journal
of
Justice
,
as
a
co-conspirator
in
Relivashs
scheme.
Both
men
were
apprehended
while
seeking
asylum
in
Noxus
and
now
face
trial
at
the
Institute
of
War
.
A
joint
investigation
led
by
Jarvan
IV
and
Katarina
Du
Couteau
traced
the
evidence
found
in
Demacia
to
Relivash.
At
his
residence
investigators
uncovered
a
model
of
the
DSS
Excursion,
and
coded
notes
detailing
its
sabotage,
validating
the
evidence
discovered
in
Demacia
earlier
this
month.
&quot;Relivash
had
been
trying
to
frame
Noxus
all
along,&quot;
commented
Katarina.
&quot;He
put
us
and
Demacia
against
each
other

all
so
the
League
could
claim
the
nexuses
in
Kalamanda!&quot;
Among
the
evidence
uncovered
was
a
collection
of
communications
between
Heywan
Relivash
and
an
unnamed
contact,
referred
to
simply
as
'RF.'
Upon
further
investigation,
the
dates
of
these
communications
lined
up
perfectly
to
events
in
Kalamanda.
&quot;The
Journal
of
Justice
was
used
to
pass
secret
and
coded
information
from
Heywan
to
participants
in
the
conspiracy,
and
Ralston
Farnsley
was
his
primary
contact,&quot;
explained
Jarvan
IV.
Authorities
apprehended
Relivash
and
Farnsley
after
Talon
,
acting
independently,
tracked
them
to
the
outskirts
of
Noxus.
They
were
brought
into
custody
before
they
could
seek
asylum
within
Noxus's
walls.
Relivash
and
Farnsley's
network
of
co-conspirators
included
many
authors
of
the
Journal
of
Justice.
Arrests
of
these
contacts
will
continue
over
the
coming
weeks
as
evidence
is
further
reviewed.
Despite
the
arrests
made,
outcry
against
the
Institute
of
War
in
the
streets
of
Demacia
and
Noxus
continues.
In
response
to
the
rising
tension,
High
Councilor
Vessaria
Kolminye
made
this
statement:
&quot;Citizens
of
Valoran
,
the
League
of
Legends
promised
your
protection,
and
in
that
we
have
failed.
Yet
in
the
wake
of
these
events,
we
must
remain
strong.
We
must
not
allow
the
selfish
actions
of
one
man
to
tear
apart
what
we
have
built.
We
cannot
succumb
to
war
when
we
have
committed
ourselves
to
lasting
peace.
Stand
with
us
and
we
shall
rebuild.&quot;
Just
Goodbyes
Final
Thoughts
from
the
Journal
of
Justice
Staff
Kaldera
Carnadine
at
the
Institute
of
War
Well,
faithful
readers,
this
is
it:
the
end
of
the
Journal
of
Justice
.
Our
Editor-in-chief
Ralston
Farnsleys
involvement
in
the
Relivash
scandal
has
removed
us
from
the
Institutes
good
graces.
So
were
being
shut
down.
None
of
us
saw
this
coming

well,
most
of
us,
because
I
hear
Henril
Dreving
was
arrested
an
hour
ago.
The
rest
of
our
staff
aren't
frantically
changing
their
names
and
fleeing
to
Piltover
for
a
getaway
blimp
to
Bilgewater
,
so
I'm
hoping
that
we
don't
have
much
more
to
hide.
Since
our
former
editor-in-chief
is
currently
being
held
prisoner
at
the
Institute
of
War,
there
arent
exactly
any
rules
to
follow
this
issue.
Many
of
us
wanted
to
thank
you
for
your
continued
support.
So
I
rallied
those
of
us
who
hadnt
already
packed
up
their
quills
and
headed
home

yes,
even
L.B.
Briskes.
Hed
tell
you
it
cost
me
a
bottle
of
Rabble
Rouser
V.S.O.P.
and
a
promise
to
never
bother
him
again,
but
answer
me
this,
summoners:
whats
one
jaded,
melodramatic,
endlessly
vain
writer
without
an
audience
to
marvel
and
sigh
ponderously
at
his
every
word?
Ram
Steed
showed
up
at
our
office
the
other
day
for
the
first
time
in
months,
ready
to
&quot;spread
the
truth&quot;
and
&quot;tell
the
whole
story.&quot;
When
I
told
him
he'd
only
get
one
more
chance
to
do
so,
he
went
red
as
a
rigged
hexplosive
and
started
writing
immediately.
And
of
course
Richor
and
Aria
will
never
hesitate
at
a
chance
at
the
last
word.
Thats
it,
then:
Kaldera
Carnadine,
signing
off.
Thank
you
for
everything,
summoners,
and
farewell!
L.B.
Briskes
at
the
Institute
of
War
&quot;All
good
things
must
come
to
an
end&quot;
appears
to
be
the
mood
of
the
day.
It
began
when
I
found
that
some
indignant
staff
member
had
(in
an
act
of
long-suppressed
resentment)
poured
upon
my
office
floor
the
full
contents
of
my
guest
bar,
my
desktop
aperitif,
my
second
drawer
whiskey
flask,
my
hollowed-runebook
cognac,
my
false
statue
vino
backup
flask,
and
my
trapdoor
moonshine.
Then,
as
I
sat
broodingly
imbibing
the
last
of
my
artificial
plant
vase
bourbon,
I
was
informed
that
the
propagandist
drivel
my
fellow
journalists
have
masqueraded
as
a
reliable
news
source
was,
to
my
surprise,
in
fact
propagandist
drivel.
I
was
then
informed
that
I
would
be
allowed
only
a
few
hours
to
remove
any
cherished
belongings
from
the
office.
I
informed
the
messenger
that
this
would
be
a
pointless
pursuit
without
the
aid
of
a
mop.
So
it
seems
that
my
time
as
the
sunny
relief
of
our
dubious
publication
is
nearing
its
end.
Though
I
have,
in
many
instances,
insisted
that
I
would
rather
administer
exfoliant
to
the
Baron
or
involve
myself
in
an
intellectual
debate
with
Doctor
Mundo
than
actually
work
for
my
living,
I
would
like
to
take
this
final
moment
to
reiterate
the
point.
This
is
liberation
at
its
truest.
Ive
already
engaged
Olivia
to
schedule
a
sampling
tour
of
the
vineyards
of
Northern
Ionia
.
I
have
also
dispatched
a
note
to
a
fellow
author
named
Lain,
who
writes
what
I
can
only
describe
as
distilled
leachate
for
a
competing
rag.
He
details
how
I
will
be
basking
on
coastlines
around
Valoran
unfettered
by
deadlines,
or
word
counts,
or
moral
restraints
while
he
struggles
to
form
cogent
written
thoughts.
I
think
I
may
keep
a
new
journal
of
sorts
outlining
my
exploits
with
only
the
modicum
of
poetic
license
that
I
regularly
reserve
for
myself,
just
to
harrow
him.
Anyhow,
Olivia
is
currently
regarding
me
with
an
expression
that
might
be
characterized
as
&quot;caustically
contemptuous&quot;
and
my
vase
has
dripped
its
final
drop.
Farewell
my
helplessly
adoring
masses,
you
will
be
missed...
by
my
now
unemployable
colleagues.
I,
on
the
other
hand,
am
merrily
off
to
retrieve
my
emergency
tree
trunk
liqueur!

from
Noxus
Our
duty
here
has
come
to
an
end,
Summoners!
The
League
has
spoken,
and
the
voice
of
the
people
falls
silent.
The
perfidy
of
Ralston
Farnsley
and
his
cohorts
has
placed
a
black
mark
upon
this
office,
and
so,
leaderless,
those
that
remain
shall
retire
to
our
respective
principalities.
For
all
you
true
sons
of
Noxus
,
consider
this
your
rallying
call.
The
League
of
Legends
has
shown
that
even
their
halls
are
not
impenetrable
to
anarchists
and
conspirators.
Only
one
bastion
remains
for
the
ranks
of
the
faithful.
The
banner
men
are
gathering
in
the
halls
of
your
homeland.
Embrace
this
new
era
under
the
watchful
eyes
of
the
raven!
Forever
strong!
Aria
Breker
reporting
from
Demacia
Citizens
of
Demacia
:
dangerous
times
lie
ahead.
I
will
not
waste
what
small
space
I
have
here
on
frivolous
words.
The
situation
is
dire:
despite
the
faith
we've
placed
in
its
leaders,
the
Institute
of
War
has
proven
itself
a
duplicitous
and
unjust
ally.
Swain,
the
Master
Tactician
,
has
risen
to
power
in
Noxus
,
uniting
the
High
Command
beneath
what
any
true
Demacian
knows
to
be
his
tyranny.
In
these
grave
times,
Demacia
must
stand
alone.
We
can
rely
on
nothing
but
our
own
ideals,
our
own
convictions.
We
must
stand
against
the
conniving
greed
of
the
Institute
of
War
and
the
endless
bloodlust
of
the
Noxian
war
machine.
Our
light,
just
and
true,
must
drive
back
the
darkness.
Stand
proud,
citizens,
and
strike
at
the
heart
of
injustice
itself.
Demacia:
now
and
forever.
Ram
Steed
at
the
Institute
of
War
Greetings
friends,
Runeterrans
,
countrymen!
It
is
I,
Ram
Steed,
and
I
have
returned.
Let
me
assure
you
that
the
rumors
about
me
have
been
true

I
have
been
silenced!
Until
now!
Kaldera
has
given
me
leave
to
once
again
take
up
the
quill
in
service
of
the
Journal
of
Justice
and
this
reporter
is
unafraid
to
kick
the
steaming
piles
of
offal
they
called
management
and
yell,
&quot;Finally!
You
couldn't
have
fallen
soon
enough!
Too
bad
you
had
to
destroy
this
bastion
of
journalism
on
your
way
down,
you
snakes!&quot;
Oh,
all
those
months
ago.
I
was
barely
recovered
from
being
made
Shaco's
pin
cushion,
fired
up
and
ready
for
action.
And
where
was
that
action?
Kalamanda
.
This
reporter
used
his
keen
intellect
and
relentless
investigation
skills
to
dive
straight
to
the
heart
of
the
matter

and
I
found
it.
Before
I
could
bring
this
world-shaking
news
to
light,
High
Councilor
Heywan
Relivash
and
his
conspiratorial
goons
got
me
and
laid
the
blackest
of
blackmails
to
keep
me
silent.
No
longer!
Good
riddance,
Ralston
Farnsley!
Even
if
you
weren't
a
blackguard,
you
wouldn't
know
real
journalism
if
it
bit
off
your
leg!
Rot
in
your
dungeon,
Heywan
Relivash!
Thank
you
for
finally
revealing
the
disease
that
festers
in
the
heart
of
the
League
!
And
to
the
rest
of
you
who've
participated
in
duping
the
citizens
of
Valoran
,
I
raise
high
the
famous
Ram
Steed
one-finger
salute!
Let
justice
be
served!
Keep
the
faith,
seekers
of
the
truth!
This
reporter
is
once
again
unleashed
upon
the
world!

			  Katarina and Talon arrive in Noxus to witness Swains coronation as Grand General. 
 
 Swain Seizes Power in Noxus 
 Master Tactician named Grand General after defeating Keiran Darkwill 
 
 
 Kaldera Carnadine reporting from Noxus 

 Jericho Swain defeated Keiran Darkwill in a duel contesting the leadership of Noxus last night, winning the support of High Command. Despite rumors of involvement with the Institute of Wars scandal in Kalamanda, Swain has been named Grand Generalthe highest position in Noxus. 

 High Command remained divided in support between the two men since Swain returned earlier this month. Keiran Darkwill challenged Swain to a duel to settle the dispute, claiming that such a standstill was a cowards game. Many members of High Command believed this to be a strong move and expected Keiran, a notoriously skilled duelist, to win. 

 Onlookers reported that Keiran initially had the upper hand and gradually forced Swain into a corner. He had the Master Tactician against the wall, stated one witness. I heard him say watch closely, and he vanishedthen reappeared behind Keiran. Swain dragged him to the ground and locked the poor fool in his snare spell. With Keiran immobilized Swain called General Darius, his most prominent supporter, to his side. 

 
 
 
 

 Swain declared victory and left Darius to evaluate the strength of Keiran Darkwill, explained Chancellor Malek Hawkmoon. That didnt take Darius long. Without a word, he raised his axeand removed Darkwills head. 

 The gathered members of High Command unanimously agreed to swear loyalty to the Master Tactician. With none remaining to protest his claim, High Command named Jericho Swain Grand General of Noxus. It was the finest demonstration of power I have ever witnessed, stated Chancellor Malek Hawkmoon. Swain rose to the challenge of his opponent, used his wit and cunning to best him, and demonstrated his ability to command. Noxus under Jericho Swains rule shall be powerful indeed. 

 While High Command has embraced his rule, Swains leadership remains controversial in Noxuss lower houses. Some accuse Swain of willing participation in Heywan Relivashs scheme to obtain Kalamanda. Katarina, the Sinister Blade herself, commented: He gave Kalamanda to the League in exchange for power in Noxus. A bold move. A strong move. The strong may rise to power here, but this wouldnt be Noxus if there werent always others with the strength to challenge them. 

 
 
 
 
 Heywan Relivash and Ralston Farnsley Arrested 
 High Councilor and Journal of Justice Senior Editor Implicated in Conspiracy 
 
 
 Quinton Groat reporting from the Institute of War 

 Authorities arrested Heywan Relivash earlier this week after an investigation of his residence revealed his involvement in the Kalamanda scandal. The uncovered evidence also implicated Ralston Farnsley, the senior editor of the Journal of Justice, as a co-conspirator in Relivashs scheme. Both men were apprehended while seeking asylum in Noxus and now face trial at the Institute of War. 

 A joint investigation led by Jarvan IV and Katarina Du Couteau traced the evidence found in Demacia to Relivash. At his residence investigators uncovered a model of the DSS Excursion, and coded notes detailing its sabotage, validating the evidence discovered in Demacia earlier this month. Relivash had been trying to frame Noxus all along, commented Katarina. He put us and Demacia against each otherall so the League could claim the nexuses in Kalamanda! 

 Among the evidence uncovered was a collection of communications between Heywan Relivash and an unnamed contact, referred to simply as RF. Upon further investigation, the dates of these communications lined up perfectly to events in Kalamanda. 

 
 
 
 

 The Journal of Justice was used to pass secret and coded information from Heywan to participants in the conspiracy, and Ralston Farnsley was his primary contact, explained Jarvan IV. 

 Authorities apprehended Relivash and Farnsley after Talon, acting independently, tracked them to the outskirts of Noxus. They were brought into custody before they could seek asylum within Noxuss walls. Relivash and Farnsleys network of co-conspirators included many authors of the Journal of Justice. Arrests of these contacts will continue over the coming weeks as evidence is further reviewed. 

 Despite the arrests made, outcry against the Institute of War in the streets of Demacia and Noxus continues. In response to the rising tension, High Councilor Vessaria Kolminye made this statement: Citizens of Valoran, the League of Legends promised your protection, and in that we have failed. Yet in the wake of these events, we must remain strong. We must not allow the selfish actions of one man to tear apart what we have built. We cannot succumb to war when we have committed ourselves to lasting peace. Stand with us and we shall rebuild. 

 
 
 
 
 Just Goodbyes 
 Final Thoughts from the Journal of Justice Staff 
 
 
 Kaldera Carnadine at the Institute of War 

 Well, faithful readers, this is it: the end of the Journal of Justice. Our Editor-in-chief Ralston Farnsleys involvement in the Relivash scandal has removed us from the Institutes good graces. So were being shut down. None of us saw this comingwell, most of us, because I hear Henril Dreving was arrested an hour ago. The rest of our staff arent frantically changing their names and fleeing to Piltover for a getaway blimp to Bilgewater, so Im hoping that we dont have much more to hide. 

 Since our former editor-in-chief is currently being held prisoner at the Institute of War, there arent exactly any rules to follow this issue. Many of us of us wanted to thank you for your continued support. So I rallied those of us who hadnt already packed up their quills and headed homeyes, even L.B. Briskes. Hed tell you it cost me a bottle of Rabble Rouser V.S.O.P. and a promise to never bother him again, but answer me this, summoners: whats one jaded, melodramatic, endlessly vain writer without an audience to marvel and sigh ponderously at his every word? 

 Ram Steed showed up at our office the other day for the first time in months, ready to spread the truth and tell the whole story. When I told him hed only get one more chance to do so, he went red as a rigged hexplosive and started writing immediately. 

 And of course Richor and Aria will never hesitate at a chance at the last word. 

 Thats it, then: Kaldera Carnadine, signing off. Thank you for everything, summoners, and farewell! 

 

 L.B. Briskes at the Institute of War 

 All good things must come to an end appears to be the mood of the day. It began when I found that some indignant staff member had (in an act of long-suppressed resentment) poured upon my office floor the full contents of my guest bar, my desktop aperitif, my second drawer whiskey flask, my hollowed-runebook cognac, my false statue vino backup flask, and my trapdoor moonshine. Then, as I sat broodingly imbibing the last of my artificial plant vase bourbon, I was informed that the propagandist drivel my fellow journalists have masqueraded as a reliable news source was, to my surprise, in fact propagandist drivel. I was then informed that I would be allowed only a few hours to remove any cherished belongings from the office. I informed the messenger that this would be a pointless pursuit without the aid of a mop. 

 So it seems that my time as the sunny relief of our dubious publication is nearing its end. 

 Though I have, in many instances, insisted that I would rather administer exfoliant to the Baron or involve myself in an intellectual debate with Doctor Mundo than actually work for my living, I would like to take this final moment to reiterate the point. This is liberation at its truest. Ive already engaged Olivia to schedule a sampling tour of the vineyards of Northern Ionia. I have also dispatched a note to a fellow author named Lain, who writes what I can only describe as distilled leachate for a competing rag. He details how I will be basking on coastlines around Valoran unfettered by deadlines, or word counts, or moral restraints while he struggles to form cogent written thoughts. I think I may keep a new journal of sorts outlining my exploits with only the modicum of poetic license that I regularly reserve for myself, just to harrow him. 
 Anyhow, Olivia is currently regarding me with an expression that might be characterized as caustically contemptuous and my vase has dripped its final drop. Farewell my helplessly adoring masses, you will be missed... by my now unemployable colleagues. I, on the other hand, am merrily off to retrieve my emergency tree trunk liqueur! 

 
 

 
 



 Richor Ebony reporting from Noxus 

 Our duty here has come to an end, Summoners! The League has spoken, and the voice of the people falls silent. The perfidy of Ralston Farnsley and his cohorts has placed a black mark upon this office, and so, leaderless, those that remain shall retire to our respective principalities. 

 For all you true sons of Noxus, consider this your rallying call. The League of Legends has shown that even their halls are not impenetrable to anarchists and conspirators. Only one bastion remains for the ranks of the faithful. The banner men are gathering in the halls of your homeland. Embrace this new era under the watchful eyes of the raven! 

 Forever strong! 


 Aria Breker reporting from Demacia 

 Citizens of Demacia: dangerous times lie ahead. 

 I will not waste what small space I have here on frivolous words. The situation is dire: despite the faith weve placed in its leaders, the Institute of War has proven itself a duplicitous and unjust ally. Swain, the Master Tactician, has risen to power in Noxus, uniting the High Command beneath what any true Demacian knows to be his tyranny. In these grave times, Demacia must stand alone. We can rely on nothing but our own ideals, our own convictions. We must stand against the conniving greed of the Institute of War and the endless bloodlust of the Noxian war machine. 

 Our light, just and true, must drive back the darkness. Stand proud, citizens, and strike at the heart of injustice itself. 

 Demacia: now and forever. 


 Ram Steed at the Institute of War 

 Greetings friends, Runeterrans, countrymen! It is I, Ram Steed, and I have returned. Let me assure you that the rumors about me have been true I have been silenced! Until now! Kaldera has given me leave to once again take up the quill in service of the Journal of Justice and this reporter is unafraid to kick the steaming piles of offal they called management and yell, Finally! You couldn't have fallen soon enough! Too bad you had to destroy this bastion of journalism on your way down, you snakes! 

 Oh, all those months ago. I was barely recovered from being made Shaco's pin cushion, fired up and ready for action. And where was that action? Kalamanda. This reporter used his keen intellect and relentless investigation skills to dive straight to the heart of the matter and I found it. Before I could bring this world-shaking news to light, High Councilor Heywan Relivash and his conspiratorial goons got me and laid the blackest of blackmails to keep me silent. No longer! 

 Good riddance, Ralston Farnsley! Even if you weren't a blackguard, you wouldn't know real journalism if it bit off your leg! Rot in your dungeon, Heywan Relivash! Thank you for finally revealing the disease that festers in the heart of the League! And to the rest of you who've participated in duping the citizens of Valoran, I raise high the famous Ram Steed one-finger salute! Let justice be served! 

 Keep the faith, seekers of the truth! This reporter is once again unleashed upon the world!

There
are
those
sorcerers
who
give
themselves
over
to
the
primal
powers
of
nature,
forgoing
the
learned
practice
of
magic.
Such
a
sorceress
is
Janna,
who
first
learned
magic
as
an
orphan
growing
up
amidst
the
chaos
that
is
the
city-state
of
Zaun
.
Janna
eked
out
what
living
she
could
on
the
streets.
Life
was
tough
and
dangerous
for
the
beautiful
young
girl,
and
she
survived
by
her
wits,
and
by
stealing
when
wits
weren't
enough.
The
rampant
magic
that
characterizes
Zaun
was
the
first
and
most
alluring
tool
which
Janna
realized
could
both
protect
and
elevate
her.
Janna
discovered
that
she
had
an
affinity
for
a
particular
type
of
magic
-
the
elemental
magic
of
air.
She
mastered
her
studies
of
air
magic
in
a
matter
of
months,
almost
as
if
she
was
born
of
it.
Janna
went
from
a
street
vagrant
to
an
avatar
of
the
air
virtually
overnight,
stunning
and
surpassing
those
who
taught
her.
Such
a
rapid
ascension
also
changed
her
physical
appearance,
giving
her
an
otherworldly
look.
Seeking
to
right
the
injustice
in
the
world
(particularly
the
insanity
that
has
become
the
city
of
Zaun),
Janna
has
brought
her
talents
to
the
League
.
She
is
a
voice
for
the
regulation
of
magical
experimentation
and
a
supporter
of
the
development
of
techmaturgy,
making
her
an
indirect
ally
of
the
city-state
of
Piltover
and
the
amazing
techmaturgical
minds
that
live
there.
Janna
is
also
a
new
favorite
of
the
League's
many
fans.
She
is
often
the
center
of
attention
at
functions,
fan
appreciation
days,
and
other
celebratory
events.
There
is
something
untouchable
about
Janna,
however,
and
her
affections
can
change
as
quickly
as
the
wind.
&quot;Do
not
be
captivated
by
Janna's
beauty.
Like
the
wind,
she
is
one
gust
away
from
terrible
destruction.&quot;

There
are
those
sorcerers
who
give
themselves
over
to
the
primal
powers
of
nature,
forgoing
the
learned
practice
of
magic.
Such
a
sorceress
is
Janna,
who
first
learned
magic
as
an
orphan
growing
up
amidst
the
chaos
that
is
the
city-state
of
Zaun
.
Janna
eked
out
what
living
she
could
on
the
streets.
Life
was
tough
and
dangerous
for
the
beautiful
young
girl,
and
she
survived
by
her
wits,
and
by
stealing
when
wits
weren't
enough.
The
rampant
magic
that
characterizes
Zaun
was
the
first
and
most
alluring
tool
which
Janna
realized
could
both
protect
and
elevate
her.
Janna
discovered
that
she
had
an
affinity
for
a
particular
type
of
magic
-
the
elemental
magic
of
air.
She
mastered
her
studies
of
air
magic
in
a
matter
of
months,
almost
as
if
she
was
born
of
it.
Janna
went
from
a
street
vagrant
to
an
avatar
of
the
air
virtually
overnight,
stunning
and
surpassing
those
who
taught
her.
Such
a
rapid
ascension
also
changed
her
physical
appearance,
giving
her
an
otherworldly
look.
Seeking
to
right
the
injustice
in
the
world
(particularly
the
insanity
that
has
become
the
city
of
Zaun),
Janna
has
brought
her
talents
to
the
League
.
She
is
a
voice
for
the
regulation
of
magical
experimentation
and
a
supporter
of
the
development
of
techmaturgy,
making
her
an
indirect
ally
of
the
city-state
of
Piltover
and
the
amazing
techmaturgical
minds
that
live
there.
Janna
is
also
a
new
favorite
of
the
League's
many
fans.
She
is
often
the
center
of
attention
at
functions,
fan
appreciation
days,
and
other
celebratory
events.
There
is
something
untouchable
about
Janna,
however,
and
her
affections
can
change
as
quickly
as
the
wind.
&quot;Do
not
be
captivated
by
Janna's
beauty.
Like
the
wind,
she
is
one
gust
away
from
terrible
destruction.&quot;

Turmoil
in

new
leader
swears
fealty
to
Ashe
Bob
Nashahago
reporting
from
Rakelstake,
Freljord
Princess
Lissandra
is
crowned
in
Rakelstake
after
the
death
of
Princess
Mauvole

1
August,
20
CLE
The
freezing
tundra
of
Freljord
is
rapidly
boiling
over
with
a
tense
confrontation,
as
the
current
standoff
between
the
three
tribes
that
have
dominated
the
region
for
decades
suddenly
finds
itself
at
a
possible
conclusion.
One
of
the
rulers
of
the
three
tribes
that
control
this
region

Princess
Mauvole,
the
Ice
Dervish

was
found
dead
in
her
quarters
three
days
ago
in
the
city
of
Rakelstake.
The
elders
of
her
tribe
determined
the
cause
of
death
to
be
natural,
which
cleared
the
way
for
the
new
Princess,
Lissandra
,
to
claim
her
throne
and
the
title
of
Ice
Dervish.
In
Princess
Lissandras
first
act
after
her
coronation,
she
stunned
her
new
subjects
as
she
swore
fealty
to
another
of
the
three
Princesses
of
Freljord:
Ashe,
the
Frost
Archer
.
In
addition
to
her
royal
status,
Ashe
is
also
a
well-known
champion
within
the
League
of
Legends
.
In
her
coronation
speech,
Lissandra
pleaded
with
her
people
that
the
time
had
come
to
unite
Freljord
under
a
single
banner.
&quot;For
too
long,
we
have
endured
hardships
from
external
politics
and
internal
strife.
Today
is
the
day
that
the
citizens
of
the
Freljord
choose
to
end
this
madness,
and
it
begins
from
within.
It
begins
when
we,
the
noble
tribe
of
the
Ice
Dervish,
put
the
needs
of
our
people
above
the
needs
of
our
pride
and
recognize
Princess
Ashe...
as
the
true
power
to
lead
Freljord,
united
and
strong.&quot;
Lissandras
words
have
seemingly
swayed
her
kin;
her
coronation
speech
was
warmly
received
by
her
tribe,
and
her
tribes
elders
have
each
signaled
their
solidarity
with
their
Princesses
desire
for
unification.
Plans
have
been
made
for
Lissandra
and
Ashe
to
convene
in
Rakelstake
within
the
month.
The
road
to
Freljord
unification
is
far
from
secured,
as
the
third
of
the
Freljord
Princesses

Sejuani,
the
Winter's
Claw

remains
fiercely
adamant
in
her
opposition
of
the
other
two.
&quot;It's
clear
the
Ice
Dervish
has
lapsed
in
judgment
and
succumbed
to
the
manipulations
of
the
Frost
Archer.
The
'united
Freljord'
the
naive
Lissandra
speaks
of
is
nothing
more
than
a
totalitarian
state
wherein
she
kneels
at
the
right
hand
of
the
tyrant.
So
long
as
I
draw
in
breath,
the
tribe
of
the
Winter's
Claw
will
never
sully
its
name
next
to
those
of
such
conspirators.&quot;
Upon
issuing
this
announcement,
Sejuani
retreated
to
isolation
with
the
elders
of
her
tribe.
This
has
caused
concern
amongst
the
members
of
the
other
tribes
in
that
she
may
be
readying
for
war.
When
questioned
about
the
matter,
Ashe
issued
the
following
comment:
&quot;We
pursue
a
future
in
which
our
children
do
not
have
to
fear
their
far-removed
kin,
and
we
may
live
again
in
peace
in
this
land.
Nevertheless,
we
Freljordians
have
borne
the
bite
of
countless
winters,
and
we
have
not
forgotten
how
to
endure.&quot;
Why
We
Summon
The
Editor-in-Chief
addresses
the
summoning
layman
Senior
Summoner
Ralston
Farnsley
commenting
from
the
Institute
of
War
I
do
not
think
it
premature
to
declare
the
premier
issue
of
the
Journal
of
Justice
a
success.
Not
to
sound
vainglorious,
but
this
was
certainly
no
surprise
to
me
when
reading
the
copious
amount
of
feedback
we
received.
I
genuinely
feel
that
this
success
is
accredited
to
you,
the
summoners
of
the
League
of
Legends,
and
the
enthusiasm
you
have
for
this
publication.
What
was
surprising
to
me,
however,
was
the
rapid
growth
of
the
JoJ
outside
the
summoning
circles
of
the
Institute
of
War.
People
from
all
walks
of
life
are
looking
to
the
JoJ
as
their
leading
source
of
information
about
Valoran
and
beyond.
For
that,
I
thank
them

and
thank
you,
summoners,
for
your
continued
patronage.
It
is
important
for
us
to
be
open
about
our
dealings

both
with
the
Journal
and
with
the
League
of
Legends.
As
we
arbitrate
a
multitude
of
sensitive
and
complex
political
issues
from
our
client
city-states,
we
sometimes
forget
the
true
reasons
why
the
League
even
exists.
With
each
passing
day,
fewer
of
us
remember
the
horrors
of
the
last
Rune
War

the
fifth
in
a
series
of
cataclysmic
confrontations
involving
powerful
magicians
who
put
their
own
interests
above
all
else.
These
fools
would
rather
have
ruled
over
a
wasteland
of
twisted
magic
than
share
a
responsible
mantle
of
governorship.
Imagine
if
our
beautiful
world
had
succumbed
to
these
petty
tyrants!
What
would
Runeterra
be
like
had
those
who
would
destroy
us
all
been
left
to
lead?
That
would
be
a
world
not
worth
living
in.
For
those
new
to
the
Journal
and
those
new
to
the
ways
of
the
League

this
is
why
we
summon.
We
summon
to
resolve
the
conflicts
of
individuals
and
city-states
who,
if
left
unchecked,
would
use
terrible
magic
against
one
another.
We
summon
to
regulate
the
use
of
magic
by
a
civilization
that
has
proven
itself
incapable
of
self-regulation
on
five
separate
occasions.
We
summon
to
ensure
that
there
is
a
world
to
hand
to
our
children
that
is
as
blessed
and
as
bountiful
as
we
enjoy
it
today

and
have
done
so
for
the
past
twenty
years.
Starting
with
the
next
issue,
the
Journal
of
Justice
will
answer
select
questions
from
you,
our
readers.
Before
this
begins,
however,
I
felt
it
especially
important
to
speak
plainly
about
the
stakes
of
what
we
do.
The
League
is
more
than
a
simple
court
of
arbitration.
It
is
the
foundation
of
security
and
stability
that
we
all
have
come
to
depend
on
for
nearly
twenty
years.
It
has
a
proven
track
record
of
success.
Who
amongst
us
would
have
imagined
the
day
when
the
likes
of
Demacia
and
Noxus
would
agree
to
settle
their
disputes
without
going
to
war?
This
is
why
I
summon...
for
peace.
Anti-Yordle
Sentiment
Rising
in
Noxus
Revelation
of
proposed
law
stirs
non-human
outrage
Tobias
Drumm
reporting
from
Noxus
The
Noxian
High
Command
is
secretly
considering
a
request
to
ban
yordles
from
within
the
Noxus
city
boundaries,
reports
an
anonymous
source
close
to
the
High
Command.
The
Journal
of
Justice
is
the
first
to
reveal
that
Noxus'
Witherwood
Arcane
College
has
presented
this
request
to
the
High
Command,
along
with
a
secret
report
claiming
that
such
a
ban
would
protect
Noxian
citizens
from
an
unspecified
&quot;contamination.&quot;
The
Witherwood
report
also
claims
to
have
significant
evidence
that
all
of
Runeterras
non-human
sentient
species
are
in
fact
deformed
descendants
of
ancient
human
tribes.
Of
particular
note
is
the
reports
alleged
final
claim,
that
this
deformation
was
the
result
of
the
tribes'
failing
to
use
sufficient
quantities
of
magic
in
their
development,
while
more
&quot;enlightened&quot;
civilizations

human
civilizations

kept
better
control
of
mystic
energies
and
retained
their
&quot;human
purity.&quot;
While
our
source
promises
the
anti-yordle
request
is
sure
to
be
rejected
as
secretly
as
it
was
proposed,
the
fact
that
the
Witherwood
report
is
being
read
at
all
is
typical
of
predatory
Noxian
attitudes.
At
least
one
High
Command
officer
was
reported
saying,
&quot;Guess
we
better
use
more
magic,
so
its
not
our
children
turning
up
with
fur.&quot;
History
Professor
Josin
Darawee
of
the
Grand
Demacian
University
expressed
great
concern
over
the
Witherwood
report.
&quot;These
claims
are
preposterous!
Firstly,
five
minutes
study
of
history
proves
that
non-humans
have
existed
on
Runeterra
as
long
as
their
human
cousins.
Second,
to
imply
that
increased
sorcery
makes
its
users
MORE
safe
is
the
worst
kind
of
delusion,
an
attempt
to
turn
the
horrors
of
the
Rune
Wars
into
nothing
more
than
'well
hit
you
first!'
No
surprise
its
some
of
Noxus'
magical
weapons
consultants
that
'discovered'
it!&quot;
The
abuse
of
yordles
and
other
non-humans
in
Noxus
has
been
a
source
of
longtime
concern,
although
it
usually
takes
the
form
of
harsh
attitudes
on
the
Noxian
street
rather
than
official
pressure.
Away
from
the
city,
non-humans
such
as
the
Great
Barrier
minotaurs
have
historically
been
as
likely
as
humans
to
face
Noxian
raids.
Noxus'
small
community
of
non-humans,
mostly
visitors
to
the
city,
appeared
to
have
no
knowledge
of
the
Witherwood
report.
Yordles
in
particular
refused
to
comment,
although
several
that
were
interviewed
were
then
seen
rapidly
packing
their
belongings.
League
Champion
Katarina
,
speaking
on
behalf
of
Noxus,
denied
that
the
Witherwood
report
was
ever
made.
She
added,
&quot;Noxus
has
always
treated
every
contributing
member
as
fairly
as
they
deserve.
Really,
would
any
Noxian
official
even
leak
such
an
absurd
story
to
the
news,
or
expect
to
live
if
he
did?
Instead
of
repeating
obvious
Demacian
lies,
any
yordles
afraid
their
people
are
being
mistreated
in
Noxus
should
sign
up
for
our
northern
barbarian-pacification
campaign
to
remind
us
how
clever
those
little
hands
are
in
aiming
a
weapon.&quot;
UnaVoidable
Musings
(Believe
Me,
Ive
Tried)
Inquiries
regarding
the
Leagues
latest
oddballs
L.B.
Briskes
commenting
from
My
Living
Room
Any
good
sideshow
needs
its
freak,
right?
After
all,
without
bearded
ladies
and
three-armed
giants,
how
else
could
we
abide
calling
ourselves
normal?
Naturally,
when
the
peculiar
Cho'Gath
made
his
controversial
debut
in
the
League
of
Legends,
it
did
not
falter
my
derisive
scoff.
We've
certainly
seen
stranger
and
more
sensational
things
in
Valoran
.
When
Kassadin
arrived
with
his
amusing
doomsday
prophecies
and
mystically
purple
bag-of-tricks,
I
barely
paused
whilst
trimming
a
pesky
hangnail.
However,
the
advent
of
Malzahar

and
now
Kog'Maw

positively
jars
my
otherwise
blissful
contemptibility
with
uninvited
questions
concerning
their
allegedly
otherworldly
origins.
All
claim

some
vocally,
others
visually

to
have
traveled
from
the
malevolent,
ominous,
and
above
all,
spooky
Void.
Evidence
supporting
these
claims
varies
haphazardly
from
the
occasional
summoned
bug-critter
to
the
wanton
engorgement
of
man-
or
minotaur-sized
objects,
but
the
facts
seem
to
merit
a
moments
consideration.
Stories
of
the
Void
can
be
traced
back
to
the
lost
city
of
Icathia
,
a
place
with
about
as
much
proof
that
it
ever
existed
as
you
find
competitive
yordle
high-jumpers
(rockets
excluded,
cheaters).
The
believers
generally
agree
that
Icathia
was
located
in
the
Southern
half
of
Valoran
somewhere,
though
details
become
muddled
there.
Many
explorers
have
struck
out
to
discover
the
place,
but
the
only
fact
their
findings
universally
corroborate
is
that
just
about
everywhere
south
of
the
Great
Barrier
is
malevolent,
ominous,
and
spooky.
The
absence
of
evidence
is
not
the
evidence
of
absence,
but
surely
after
so
very
many
forays
into
the
southern
wilds,
someone
would
have
found
some
lingering
scrap
of
an
entire
civilization,
right?
Well
that
discounts
the
appreciable
number
of
pioneers
who
have
never
returned.
Furthermore,
the
fringe
Void
fanatics
submit
theories
of
magical
intervention,
citing
cases
in
which
explorers
have
reported
time
discrepancies
from
their
travels,
as
though
days
were
stolen.
I
have
experienced
similar
time
discrepancies
myself,
and
in
the
following
mornings
I
often
find
empty
bottles
or
glasses
that
I
swore
were
full
the
night
before.
Intrepid
journalist
that
I
am,
I
ventured
to
Summoner's
Rift
after
an
exhibition
match
for
any
comment
from
the
aforementioned
champions
which
would
quell
this
nagging
curiosity
and
restore
the
apathy
Ive
come
to
enjoy.
Cho'Gaths
and
Kog'Maw's
comments
were
tantamount
to
projectile
vomit,
both
in
eloquence
and
relevance...also
literally.
Malzahar
only
grinned
in
the
sort
of
manner
Ive
come
to
expect
from
serial
killers
and
postmen,
promising
that
Ill
&quot;soon
learn
everything
I
need
to
know.&quot;
Though
I
never
mentioned
my
investigations
of
formulas
to
sterilize
people
afflicted
by
idiocy,
I
do
hope
he
is
correct.
Kassadin
offered
perhaps
the
most
insightful
response,
stating,
&quot;You
do
not
understand
that
which
you
seek.&quot;
He
provided
further
useful
information,
&quot;Cho'Gath
and
Kog'Maw
cannot
be
trusted.&quot;
My
spittle-soaked
boots
wish
Id
conducted
this
interview
first.
So
laden
with
this
deluge
of
knowledge,
Ill
leave
you
as
informed
as
you
were
prior
to
reading
my
article,
which
I
can
only
assume
means
that
-
if
Malzahar
is
truly
correct
-
youll
also
have
an
inoculation
coming.
The
Loyal
Heart
Beats
Eternal
A
commentary
on
Noxian
philosophy,
service,
and
League
Champion
Sion
Richor
Ebony
commenting
from
Noxus
It
has
been
said
that
as
one
ascends
to
power,
one
loses
friends.
While
one
can
debate
the
merits
of
humility
until
the
sun
hangs
low
in
the
sky,
suffice
to
say
it
is
no
secret
that
my
homeland,
the
principality
of
Noxus,
has
acquired
more
than
its
fair
share
of
partisans
over
the
years.
Regardless
of
your
personal
feelings
towards
the
High
Command,
however,
there
are
few
who
could
challenge
our
dedication
to
the
loyal.
For
the
sake
of
illustration,
allow
me
to
cite
the
example
of
the
Noxian
warrior
known
as
Sion
.
A
staunch
supporter
of
our
Eternal
General,
as
well
as
a
soldier
of
high
regard,
Sions
fervor
on
the
field
before
his
accident
carried
him
to
victory
in
many
battles.
His
fame
and
renown
spread
to
the
far
corners
of
Valoran,
and
even
where
his
name
was
not
revered,
it
was
rightfully
feared.
It
could
be
said
that
the
very
quality
that
made
this
warriors
career
also
brought
it
to
its
end.
Sion
zealously
engaged
a
Demacian
force
that
was
a
bit
too
well-entrenched

even
for
a
warrior
of
his
considerable
skill.
He
was
captured
and
executed.
His
body
was
sent
back
to
Demacia
as
an
accolade
to
the
so-called
justice
of
King
Jarvan
III.
But
respect
for
the
dead
takes
many
forms,
and
Noxus
does
not
so
easily
abandon
its
own
to
adorn
the
battlements
of
an
insolent
enemy
in
tribute
to
foreign
law.
Galvanized
by
their
champions
heroic
death,
the
assassins
of
Noxus

under
the
command
of
Katarina,
the
famed
Sinister
Blade

undertook
a
dangerous
mission
to
recover
Sions
mortal
remains.
The
Demacian
propaganda
machine
may
try
to
spin
whatever
fantastic
story
it
wishes;
our
successful
venture
is
plainly
now
a
matter
of
public
record.
In
Noxus,
for
a
true
soldier,
death
does
not
have
to
be
the
end.
The
necromancers
of
the
Bleak
Academy
have
ways
of
preserving
the
ardent.
Within
Sions
still
heart,
that
same
rage

that
same
glorious
fervor
that
had
made
him
the
unstoppable
juggernaut
he
was
in
life

still
burned.
Even
now,
Sion
serves
Noxus.
He
shall
always
serve
Noxus

an
eternal
champion
of
our
banner,
stalwartly
defending
the
interests
of
the
state
on
the
Field
of
Justice.
This
is
his
just
reward
for
a
life
of
dedication
to
the
advancement
of
the
Empire,
and
to
the
glory
of
the
High
Command.
This
is
any
true
Noxian
loyalists
ultimate
reward.
Forever
strong!

Ionias
Fight
for
Freedom
Grudge
match
against
Noxus
coming
this
Friday;
summoners
and
spoils
announced
Auras
Lam
reporting
from
The
Institute
of
War
The
stage
is
set
for
the
most
hotly
anticipated
League
battle
of
the
year.
The
city-state
of
Noxus
,
having
enjoyed
the
spoils
of
Ionian
soil
for
the
last
7
years,
has
offered
Ionia
the
chance
to
re-claim
their
land
.
The
stakes
have
never
been
higher.
With
the
Noxian
occupation,
the
inhabitants
of
the
three
wealthiest
provinces
of
Ionia
have
been
forced
to
settle
into
the
Noxian
way
of
life,
however
grudgingly
so.
Ionia
has
excluded
representatives
from
these
captured
provinces
from
the
Convergence
of
Elders
as
a
means
to
prevent
political
corruption.
However,
by
agreeing
to
the
match
as
a
means
to
reclaim
their
land,
Ionia's
government
must
allow
the
inclusion
of
proper
representatives
from
the
provinces
of
Galrin,
Navori,
and
Shon-Xan
in
the
case
of
a
loss.
Should
Noxians
be
appointed
as
the
representatives,
the
Ionian
government
will
be
vulnerable
to
undesirable
influence.
Working
in
conjunction
with
the
city-states,
the
League
sought
out
summoners
of
the
highest
pedigree,
some
having
been
vocal
during
the
Ionian
protest.
The
Noxian
team,
represented
by
summoners
Vorath,
Edwy,
Roku,
Poisonidon,
and
Friend,
have
issued
the
following
statement:
&quot;Summoners,
citizens,
champions
of
the
League.
We
gather
here
this
day
to
adjudicate,
by
trial
of
arms,
the
Noxian
expansion
into
the
fertile
Ionian
provinces.
It
must
not
be
that
our
hearts
burgeon
with
treacherous
emotion
in
these
trying
times.
Rather,
we
must
maintain
a
steely
eye,
an
even
demeanor,
and
argue
the
case
with
cool
logic,
and
colder
blades.
Let
not
the
wailings
of
the
Ionian
tenderhearts
influence
you
overly
-
Noxus
has
claimed
these
lands
by
lawful
conquest
on
the
Fields
of
Justice
once,
and
all
Runeterra
shall
stand
witness
as
we
do
so
again!&quot;
Vehemently
awaiting
the
chance
to
liberate
Ionia
once
and
for
all,
the
Ionian
summoners
Poruku,
NeoIllusions,
Eclipse,
Frozt,
and
Guardsman
Bob
issued
the
following
reply:
&quot;We're
determined
to
win,
and
we
have
our
most
advanced
strategies
prepared;
losing
is
not
an
option.
We
will
show
them
the
power
of
Ionia,
and
we
will
have
freedom
as
our
reward.
All
of
those
who
have
shown
support
will
not
be
let
down.
We
have
never
stopped
believing
that
the
citizens
of
southern
Ionia
should
have
the
freedom
to
live
as
they
desire,
without
the
heavy-handed
oppression
of
another
weighing
down
upon
them.
Without
a
doubt,
balance
shall
be
restored.&quot;
Regarding
the
match,
the
buzz
heard
echoing
throughout
Valoran
appears
heavily
slanted
in
Noxus'
favor,
stirring
up
unsettlingly
familiar
feelings
of
Noxian
machinations
behind
the
scenes.
However,
since
the
original
&quot;Trial
for
the
Isle&quot;
match
7
years
ago,
Ionia
has
seen
a
great
influx
of
champions
to
the
League.
Most
notably,
the
Ionian
Captain
of
the
Guard,
Irelia
,
and
several
members
of
the
widely
respected
Kinkou
clan
are
now
in
the
champion
lineup
for
the
match.
It
took
the
painful
loss
of
their
southern
provinces
to
bring
the
Kinkou
into
the
League,
as
the
Order
had
been
controversially
opposed
to
the
use
of
force
when
the
original
battle
occurred.
Now,
it
seems,
they
are
making
good
on
their
fervent
dedication
to
the
preservation
of
balance
in
Ionia,
even
if
it
means
charging
into
the
front
lines
of
battle.
The
summoners
representing
the
winning
city-states
will
be
honored
with
a
supervised
visit
to
the
Arcanum
Vault,
located
underneath
the
Institute
of
War.
They
will
be
the
first
city-state
affiliated
summoners
to
be
allowed
access
to
the
Vault.
They
will
be
presented
with
two
items
and
granted
the
privilege
to
select
one
to
be
added
to
shop
shelves
on
the
Fields
of
Justice.
The
item
will
be
named
in
honor
of
the
victor.
The
two
items
that
the
League
has
selected
are
a
pair
of
boots
and
an
item
from
the
famed
artificer
Doran's
collection.
Both
items
grant
unique
abilities
compared
to
the
existing
boots
and
Doran's
items
currently
available.
The
item
selected
for
sale
will
be
dedicated
in
the
winning
city-state's
honor.
Be
sure
to
tune
in
this
Friday
-
10
December,
20
CLE
-
in
order
to
witness
this
momentous
occasion.
The
League
has
made
special
arrangements
to
transmit
a
live
visiopathic
feed
of
the
match,
so
be
sure
to
cozy
up
with
your
fellow
statesmen
in
support
of
your
favored
team!
General
Du
Couteau
Vanishes
The
Noxian
High
Command
recognizes
Swain
as
the
successor
to
General
Du
Couteau
Richor
Ebony
reporting
from
Noxus
One
of
Noxus'
finest
children,
the
celebrated
General
Du
Couteau,
vanished
this
past
week
under
the
most
peculiar
of
circumstances.
Last
seen
slipping
away
from
his
entourage
during
a
trip
to
the
famed
marketplace
of
the
Ivory
Ward
--
the
oldest
and
most
opulent
of
Noxus'
historic
districts
--
the
General
never
returned
to
collect
his
coterie.
When
interviewed,
the
General's
retainers
said
that
he
appeared
extremely
agitated
prior
to
his
disappearance,
having
been
observed
on
multiple
occasions
checking
his
pocket
watch
at
frequent,
neurotic
intervals.
While
we
can
only
speculate
on
what
grave
errand
compelled
Du
Couteau
to
proceed
unguarded
into
the
city,
the
increasing
length
of
his
absence
does
not
bode
well
for
a
safe
return.
His
absence
has
been
especially
hard
on
his
family,
as
the
General's
daughter
Katarina,
the
famed
Sinister
Blade
,
has
been
unable
to
leave
the
Institute
of
War
to
tend
to
familial
affairs.
With
Du
Couteau's
whereabouts
unknown,
his
seat
on
the
Noxian
High
Command
stood
vacant.
As
a
result,
General
Boram
Darkwill
came
under
pressure
from
his
cabinet
to
fill
this
unoccupied
seat
on
the
advisory
council.
He
did
so
today
at
a
private
ceremony
held
deep
within
his
inner
sanctum
at
Darkbourne
Hold,
surprising
no
one
when
he
selected
League
Champion
and
Master
Tactician
Jericho
Swain
,
one
of
his
Lieutenant
Generals,
to
succeed
the
late
General
Du
Couteau.
In
a
brief
speech
punctuating
the
ceremony,
General
Darkwill
made
the
following
comment
to
his
latest
protg:
&quot;It
is
long
overdue
that
we
recognize
your
many
accomplishments,
your
cunning,
and,
above
all,
your
unwavering
loyalty
to
the
Empire
and
to
the
High
Command.&quot;
Perhaps
just
as
curious
as
the
circumstances
of
his
promotion
was
Swain's
choice
of
companionship
for
the
evening,
which
caused
quite
a
stir
at
the
proceedings.
On
his
arm
all
night
was
none
other
than
the
infamous
(and
notoriously
reclusive)
Emilia
LeBlanc
,
who
had
not
appeared
in
public
for
decades.
Despite
being
roughly
the
same
age
as
General
Darkwill
himself,
she
appeared
as
youthful
and
vibrant
as
ever.
The
years
have
been
far
kinder
to
her
than
to
her
hardened
associate;
a
fact
that
has
only
contributed
to
continued
speculation
regarding
the
circumstances
of
her
longevity.
This
disappearance
is
not
the
first
tragedy
to
haunt
the
Du
Couteau
clan
in
recent
memory.
Earlier
in
the
year,
Cassiopeia
,
Du
Couteau's
youngest
daughter
and
former
jewel
of
the
Noxian
court,
fell
grievously
ill
following
a
short-lived
romance
with
an
envoy
from
Freljord
.
She
has
since
shut
herself
up
in
her
chambers,
seemingly
never
to
return
to
the
public
eye.
While
her
current
condition
is
unknown,
the
mortality
rate
of
servants
in
the
Du
Couteau
household
has
reached
an
all
time
high,
sparking
panic-stricken
rumors
of
contagion.
It
has
been
said
her
father's
absence
has
thrown
the
household
into
uproar,
and
that
the
distraught
Cassiopeia's
fury
can
be
heard
echoing
through
the
Du
Couteau
estate
at
all
hours.
While
General
Swain's
official
promotion
was
executed
in
haste,
the
High
Command
intends
that
he
receive
all
the
honors
and
recognition
that
he
is
due.
A
proper
celebration
with
all
the
typical
military
pageantry
is
being
scheduled
for
the
coming
week.
It
is
likely
to
be
a
great
spectacle
given
the
celebrity
afforded
to
Swain
by
his
status
as
a
champion
of
the
League
of
Legends,
and
the
city's
major
tourist
attractions
are
preparing
for
a
significant
increase
in
traffic
during
this
time.
Honor
and
glory
to
General
Jericho
Swain
of
Noxus,
newest
member
of
the
High
Command!
Forever
strong!
Giant
Rats
Invade
Southern
Ionia
Noxus
High
Command
overreacts
to
infestation
Henril
Dreving
reporting
from
Ionia
Singed
was
summoned
to
the
Navori
Province
today
to
take
charge
in
the
eradication
of
an
unexpected
giant
rat
infestation.
The
Mad
Chemist
was
top
of
mind
after
his
deft
handling
of
a
lizard
population
surge
outside
the
Institute
of
War
last
spring.
His
arrival
comes
following
the
rodent
invasion
of
a
high-profile
officers'
banquet
celebrating
the
promotion
of
Chancellor
Malek
Hawkmoon's
son,
Ameer,
to
the
rank
of
Commander
in
the
Noxian
fleet.
According
to
witnesses,
screams
interrupted
the
Military
Anthem
when
child-sized
rats
hopped
onto
tables,
knocked
over
glassware,
and
pilfered
sides
of
meat
while
ignoring
the
best
efforts
of
broom-wielding
servants.
Immediately
afterwards,
several
officers
were
overheard
demanding
immediate
action
while
carrying
unconscious
wives
and
husbands
away
from
the
scene.
It
is
believed
that
the
infestation
began
after
several
Zaunite
armament
shipments
arrived
last
month.
Local
harbor
workers
first
noticed
the
rats
scurrying
ashore
on
mooring
lines
that
tied
the
boats
to
the
docks.
Before
the
banquet
incident
occurred,
reports
concerning
sightings
of
people
carried
off
by
swarms
of
rats
and
of
entire
food-storages
being
found
empty
have
largely
been
dismissed
as
rumors
by
the
Noxian
High
Command.
Local
security
has
noted
a
level
of
coordination
and
intelligence
behind
these
occurrences
that
suggests
the
presence
of
a
mastermind
overseeing
the
infestation.
Chancellor
Hawkmoon
commented
earlier
this
week:
&quot;Zaun
has
been
our
trusted
ally
for
years
and
I'm
convinced
they
would
do
nothing
to
compromise
that
relationship.
However,
it's
my
firm
belief
that,
if
the
rats
did
come
from
Zaun
ships,
there
is
likely
only
one
creature
that
might
have
insight
into
the
matter.
We
will
be
asking
Zaun
authorities
to
investigate
further.
As
for
the
infestation
itself,
Singed
has
proven
that
he
is
adept
at
exterminating
vermin.
This
will
be
dealt
with.&quot;
With
the
accelerating
expansion
of
urban
city
centers,
demand
has
grown
for
exterminators
who
pack
increasingly
caustic
and
dangerous
chemicals.
Outside
of
his
participation
in
the
League
of
Legends,
Singed
has
built
a
business
out
of
handling
the
direst
infestations.
However,
there
are
unconfirmed
reports
that
side
effects
of
the
Master
Chemist's
work
are
more
devastating
than
the
infestations
themselves.
Whispers
of
entire
houses
sinking
into
acidic
pools
and
deadly
gas
clouds
floating
down
city
streets
have
been
only
the
most
benign
of
the
rumors.
Soraka,
the
Starchild
of
Ionia
,
responded
to
Hawkmoons
statement:
&quot;Noxus
invades
my
beloved
island,
introduces
unnatural
pests,
and
then
expects
to
solve
this
crisis
with
corrosive
chemicals
and
destruction?
We
will
not
stand
for
this
assault
on
our
fragile
land.
The
League
of
Legends
must
recognize
this
occupation
for
what
it
isa
clear
disregard
for
life
and
beauty
in
the
name
of
profit.&quot;
Singed
made
the
following
rebuttal:
&quot;The
Starchild
doesn't
have
to
worry...
much.
Noxian
citizens
in
Ionia
will
be
perfectly
safe
from
my
improved
rodenticide
formulas.
I
have
nothing
to
say
about
whether
Zaun
is
or
isn't
involved
with
the
infestation
itself.&quot;
Slow
Down
Snowdown
Don't
get
your
snowflakes
in
a
tizzy
L.B.
Briskes
commenting
from
The
Institute
of
War
I
have
a
personal
message
for
all
of
you.
I've
written
several
columns
alongside
my
crackling
fireplace,
warmed
by
the
many
one-sided
conversations
we've
shared
through
my
pen.
Despite
all
the
bitterness
and
sarcasm
some
have
implied
that
I
pepper
into
my
writing,
I
would
like
to
thank
you
in
earnest
for
being
that
nameless,
faceless
person
on
the
other
side
of
the
print.
Without
you,
I
would
feel
as
though
my
words
simply
evaporate
into
the
ether.
My
vocal
disdain
would
be
merely
a
hermit's
grump.
In
particular,
I
would
like
to
thank
you
for
assisting
me
in
winning
a
wager
with
a
certain
Mr.
Farnsley
that
I
could
not
bring
myself
to
write
an
entire
paragraph
in
&quot;the
holiday
spirit&quot;
of
the
Time
of
Snowdown
without
any
&quot;undue
sourness&quot;
like
a
good
journalistic
puppet.
Drat,
he
is
sure
to
quibble
about
that
last
part.
Sentimental
blather
aside,
we
are
fast
approaching
another
holiday
(yes,
another)
before
my
neighbor
has
seen
fit
to
remove
the
shriveled,
grinning
pumpkin-turned-raisin
which
has
withered
on
his
doorstep
since
the
Harrowing
.
Had
I
known
earlier
that
he
desired
to
decorate
his
entryway
with
rotting
garbage,
I'd
have
eagerly
obliged
from
my
own
supply.
The
Time
of
Snowdown
is
arguably
the
most
significant
Runeterran
holiday
since
it
is
the
only
occasion
wherein
citizens
of
Valoran
have
historically
agreed
to
put
aside
their
petty
differences
for
a
short
time.
During
the
chaos
of
the
Rune
Wars,
this
was
frequently
the
only
time
soldiers
were
given
leave
to
return
home.
I've
even
heard
a
few
stories
of
sworn
enemies
dining
with
each
other
during
the
break
in
hostilities.
The
food
may
have
been
generously
spiced
with
arsenic
or
gunpowder,
but
good
intentions
sometimes
come
wrapped
in
melting
or
ticking
packages.
So
why
is
this
so
universally
a
time
of
peace
and
brotherhood?
As
some
have
been
keen
to
indicate,
the
Time
of
Snowdown
heralds
the
coming
of
a
new
year.
They
submit
that
people
all
over
the
continent
would
celebrate
the
fact
that,
despite
their
other
differences,
they
had
mutually
survived
the
past
year.
However,
as
a
patron
supporter
of
the
human
spirit,
I
tend
to
believe
people
would
have
happily
slaughtered
each
other
to
welcome
in
the
next
year
but
for
the
devastating
weather
which
wrought
havoc
on
the
population.
Valoran
has
always
been
home
to
unforgiving
winters,
but
in
the
wake
of
the
Rune
Wars,
the
climate
was
in
such
a
state
that
it
was
not
uncommon
for
a
particularly
vicious
blizzard
to
claim
thousands
of
lives
from
a
single
city-state.
Depending
on
your
feelings
about
your
neighbors,
this
may
have
made
for
a
somewhat
less
festive
occasion
(or
so
I'm
told).
So
families,
since
ancient
times,
would
band
together
for
fear
of
freezing
or
being
gored
by
the
errant
falling
icicle.
Now
people
simply
band
together
to
watch
the
Snowdown
Showdown

the
League
event
themed
for
the
Time
of
Snowdown.
Once
all
the
panties
have
been
un-knotted
surrounding
this
&quot;Noxus
vs.
Ionia&quot;
tiff,
we
are
sure
to
see
some
special
matches,
runes,
costumes
and
so
forth,
built
to
be
absorbed
by
the
public.
Enjoy.
For
my
part,
I
will
celebrate
by
absorbing
an
equivalent
amount
of
eggnog
and
looking
forward
to
seeing
paper
snowflakes
and
rotting
candy
on
my
neighbor's
doorstep
until
next
summer.
The
Mailbag
of
Justice
Reader
mail
from
all
across
Valoran
-
answered!
Senior
Summoner
Ralston
Farnsley
commenting
from
the
Institute
of
War
The
Journal
of
Justice
staff
has
been
running
themselves
ragged
reporting
on
news,
what
with
every
major
city-state
of
Valoran
embroiled
in
one
feud
or
another.
However,
one
of
our
greatest
joys
in
publishing
every
issue
is
reading
the
mail
that
comes
in
from
you,
our
loyal
readers.
&quot;Can
summoners
become
champions?
And
can
champions
become
summoners
when
not
fighting
in
the
league?
If
so,
what
sanctions
would
have
to
be
put
in
place
to
make
this
happen?&quot;
--
Boogeybeast
There
are
no
restrictions
against
summoners
becoming
champions
or
vice
versa.
However,
to
fight
on
the
Fields
of
Justice
requires
different
capabilities

for
champions,
extreme
physical
and
magical
prowess;
for
summoners,
unrelenting
control
of
esoteric
summoning
magic
in
order
to
establish
a
complete
symbiosis
with
a
champion
for
the
length
of
a
given
match.
Only
the
most
skilled
mages
and
fighters
on
Runeterra
are
accepted
into
the
League,
and
to
achieve
such
skills
at
a
competitive
level
requires
an
absolute
dedication
to
one's
craft.
While
it
would
take
a
contender
of
exceptional
merit
to
make
the
transition
within
the
League,
it
would
not
be
impossible.
Given
the
quality
of
champion
and
summoner
candidates
joining
the
League
lately,
it
certainly
seems
inevitable.
&quot;
Zilean
's
affliction
with
chrono-displasia
and
his
struggle
to
find
a
cure
is
common
knowledge
by
today's
standards,
but
little
has
been
said
on
his
current
status.
Has
he
made
any
breakthroughs?
Is
he
recruiting
the
help,
say
from
Ryze
or
the
revered
inventor
himself
Heimerdinger
?
Since
it's
considered
a
disease
would
Dr.
Mundo
have
any
valid
input
on
his
case?&quot;
--
Summoner
Survient
Chrono-displasia
is
unlike
anything
that
has
ever
been
seen
on
Runeterra,
and
the
magicians
in
the
Institute
of
War
are
probably
the
only
ones
with
the
knowledge
and
magical
power
necessary
to
find
a
cure,
which
was
the
reason
Zilean
initially
came
to
the
League
of
Legends.
Zilean
has
been
in
constant
consult
with
Ryze,
and
their
latest
attempt
to
cure
chrono-displasia
uses
a
form
of
magic
similar
to
that
used
by
summoners
on
the
Fields
of
Justice.
As
Zilean
is
seized
with
visions
from
the
exact
point
in
time
that
Urtistan
was
destroyed,
he
shares
his
mind
with
Ryze,
who
examines
the
illusion
for
anomalies.
So
far,
they
have
been
able
to
pinpoint
distinct
pockets
of
strange
energy.
They
have
found
that
the
most
powerful
and
puzzling
energy
source
emits
a
magical
aura
that
gives
off
a
waveform
nearly
identical
to
that
of
Zileans
own
mind.
Beyond
that,
the
Journal
of
Justice
staff
has
no
further
knowledge,
but
with
Ryze
deep
in
research
on
the
subject,
the
answer
is
sure
to
come
soon.
&quot;While
summoning
the
champion
&quot;
Olaf
&quot;
during
routine
matches,
this
summoner
has
heard
him
mention
his
fondness
of
long
beards
and
large
belt
buckles.
Other
champions
seem
to
share
this,
such
as
Zilean,
Gragas
,
and
Gangplank
;
the
latter
of
which
obviously
follows
a
similar
trend
as
Olaf.
Has
the
Journal
of
Justice
witnessed
any
encounters
between
the
champions?&quot;
--
Ionian
Summoner,
Logan
&quot;Morrowlife&quot;
Jacobs
Funny
that
you
should
ask
this
question,
Morrowlife!
Gragas
recently
invited
the
Journal
of
Justice
staff
down
to
the
Lamplighter
Inn
in
Noxus
for
a
promotional
event
for
his
wildly
popular
brewery.
After
more
rounds
of
Graggy
Ice
than
would
be
proper
to
publish,
our
beloved
bearded
champions
got
into
a
heated
argument
about
the
intricacies
of
facial
hair
grooming.
The
disagreement
erupted
into
a
brawl
that
nearly
leveled
Noxus'
Vexallian
Square,
only
to
be
abated
by
the
promise
of
a
'Beard
Brawl
Bowl'
at
a
later
date.
Gragas
has
been
petitioning
the
League
to
allow
the
fight
on
the
Fields
of
Justice,
with
only
bearded
or
mustached
champions
in
the
lineup.
Although
the
League
does
not
have
a
history
of
allowing
personal
grudge
matches
onto
its
Fields,
perhaps
it
will
make
an
exception
for
its
highly
regarded
champions.
I
imagine
that
Noxus'
commercial
district
would
certainly
appreciate
staying
intact
for
another
decade.

in

new
leader
swears
fealty
to
Ashe
Bob
Nashahago
reporting
from
Rakelstake,
Freljord
Princess
Lissandra
is
crowned
in
Rakelstake
after
the
death
of
Princess
Mauvole

1
August,
20
CLE
The
freezing
tundra
of
Freljord
is
rapidly
boiling
over
with
a
tense
confrontation,
as
the
current
standoff
between
the
three
tribes
that
have
dominated
the
region
for
decades
suddenly
finds
itself
at
a
possible
conclusion.
One
of
the
rulers
of
the
three
tribes
that
control
this
region

Princess
Mauvole,
the
Ice
Dervish

was
found
dead
in
her
quarters
three
days
ago
in
the
city
of
Rakelstake.
The
elders
of
her
tribe
determined
the
cause
of
death
to
be
natural,
which
cleared
the
way
for
the
new
Princess,
Lissandra
,
to
claim
her
throne
and
the
title
of
Ice
Dervish.
In
Princess
Lissandras
first
act
after
her
coronation,
she
stunned
her
new
subjects
as
she
swore
fealty
to
another
of
the
three
Princesses
of
Freljord:
Ashe,
the
Frost
Archer
.
In
addition
to
her
royal
status,
Ashe
is
also
a
well-known
champion
within
the
League
of
Legends
.
In
her
coronation
speech,
Lissandra
pleaded
with
her
people
that
the
time
had
come
to
unite
Freljord
under
a
single
banner.
&quot;For
too
long,
we
have
endured
hardships
from
external
politics
and
internal
strife.
Today
is
the
day
that
the
citizens
of
the
Freljord
choose
to
end
this
madness,
and
it
begins
from
within.
It
begins
when
we,
the
noble
tribe
of
the
Ice
Dervish,
put
the
needs
of
our
people
above
the
needs
of
our
pride
and
recognize
Princess
Ashe...
as
the
true
power
to
lead
Freljord,
united
and
strong.&quot;
Lissandras
words
have
seemingly
swayed
her
kin;
her
coronation
speech
was
warmly
received
by
her
tribe,
and
her
tribes
elders
have
each
signaled
their
solidarity
with
their
Princesses
desire
for
unification.
Plans
have
been
made
for
Lissandra
and
Ashe
to
convene
in
Rakelstake
within
the
month.
The
road
to
Freljord
unification
is
far
from
secured,
as
the
third
of
the
Freljord
Princesses

Sejuani,
the
Winter's
Claw

remains
fiercely
adamant
in
her
opposition
of
the
other
two.
&quot;It's
clear
the
Ice
Dervish
has
lapsed
in
judgment
and
succumbed
to
the
manipulations
of
the
Frost
Archer.
The
'united
Freljord'
the
naive
Lissandra
speaks
of
is
nothing
more
than
a
totalitarian
state
wherein
she
kneels
at
the
right
hand
of
the
tyrant.
So
long
as
I
draw
in
breath,
the
tribe
of
the
Winter's
Claw
will
never
sully
its
name
next
to
those
of
such
conspirators.&quot;
Upon
issuing
this
announcement,
Sejuani
retreated
to
isolation
with
the
elders
of
her
tribe.
This
has
caused
concern
amongst
the
members
of
the
other
tribes
in
that
she
may
be
readying
for
war.
When
questioned
about
the
matter,
Ashe
issued
the
following
comment:
&quot;We
pursue
a
future
in
which
our
children
do
not
have
to
fear
their
far-removed
kin,
and
we
may
live
again
in
peace
in
this
land.
Nevertheless,
we
Freljordians
have
borne
the
bite
of
countless
winters,
and
we
have
not
forgotten
how
to
endure.&quot;
Why
We
Summon
The
Editor-in-Chief
addresses
the
summoning
layman
Senior
Summoner
Ralston
Farnsley
commenting
from
the
Institute
of
War
I
do
not
think
it
premature
to
declare
the
premier
issue
of
the
Journal
of
Justice
a
success.
Not
to
sound
vainglorious,
but
this
was
certainly
no
surprise
to
me
when
reading
the
copious
amount
of
feedback
we
received.
I
genuinely
feel
that
this
success
is
accredited
to
you,
the
summoners
of
the
League
of
Legends,
and
the
enthusiasm
you
have
for
this
publication.
What
was
surprising
to
me,
however,
was
the
rapid
growth
of
the
JoJ
outside
the
summoning
circles
of
the
Institute
of
War.
People
from
all
walks
of
life
are
looking
to
the
JoJ
as
their
leading
source
of
information
about
Valoran
and
beyond.
For
that,
I
thank
them

and
thank
you,
summoners,
for
your
continued
patronage.
It
is
important
for
us
to
be
open
about
our
dealings

both
with
the
Journal
and
with
the
League
of
Legends.
As
we
arbitrate
a
multitude
of
sensitive
and
complex
political
issues
from
our
client
city-states,
we
sometimes
forget
the
true
reasons
why
the
League
even
exists.
With
each
passing
day,
fewer
of
us
remember
the
horrors
of
the
last
Rune
War

the
fifth
in
a
series
of
cataclysmic
confrontations
involving
powerful
magicians
who
put
their
own
interests
above
all
else.
These
fools
would
rather
have
ruled
over
a
wasteland
of
twisted
magic
than
share
a
responsible
mantle
of
governorship.
Imagine
if
our
beautiful
world
had
succumbed
to
these
petty
tyrants!
What
would
Runeterra
be
like
had
those
who
would
destroy
us
all
been
left
to
lead?
That
would
be
a
world
not
worth
living
in.
For
those
new
to
the
Journal
and
those
new
to
the
ways
of
the
League

this
is
why
we
summon.
We
summon
to
resolve
the
conflicts
of
individuals
and
city-states
who,
if
left
unchecked,
would
use
terrible
magic
against
one
another.
We
summon
to
regulate
the
use
of
magic
by
a
civilization
that
has
proven
itself
incapable
of
self-regulation
on
five
separate
occasions.
We
summon
to
ensure
that
there
is
a
world
to
hand
to
our
children
that
is
as
blessed
and
as
bountiful
as
we
enjoy
it
today

and
have
done
so
for
the
past
twenty
years.
Starting
with
the
next
issue,
the
Journal
of
Justice
will
answer
select
questions
from
you,
our
readers.
Before
this
begins,
however,
I
felt
it
especially
important
to
speak
plainly
about
the
stakes
of
what
we
do.
The
League
is
more
than
a
simple
court
of
arbitration.
It
is
the
foundation
of
security
and
stability
that
we
all
have
come
to
depend
on
for
nearly
twenty
years.
It
has
a
proven
track
record
of
success.
Who
amongst
us
would
have
imagined
the
day
when
the
likes
of
Demacia
and
Noxus
would
agree
to
settle
their
disputes
without
going
to
war?
This
is
why
I
summon...
for
peace.
Anti-Yordle
Sentiment
Rising
in
Noxus
Revelation
of
proposed
law
stirs
non-human
outrage
Tobias
Drumm
reporting
from
Noxus
The
Noxian
High
Command
is
secretly
considering
a
request
to
ban
yordles
from
within
the
Noxus
city
boundaries,
reports
an
anonymous
source
close
to
the
High
Command.
The
Journal
of
Justice
is
the
first
to
reveal
that
Noxus'
Witherwood
Arcane
College
has
presented
this
request
to
the
High
Command,
along
with
a
secret
report
claiming
that
such
a
ban
would
protect
Noxian
citizens
from
an
unspecified
&quot;contamination.&quot;
The
Witherwood
report
also
claims
to
have
significant
evidence
that
all
of
Runeterras
non-human
sentient
species
are
in
fact
deformed
descendants
of
ancient
human
tribes.
Of
particular
note
is
the
reports
alleged
final
claim,
that
this
deformation
was
the
result
of
the
tribes'
failing
to
use
sufficient
quantities
of
magic
in
their
development,
while
more
&quot;enlightened&quot;
civilizations

human
civilizations

kept
better
control
of
mystic
energies
and
retained
their
&quot;human
purity.&quot;
While
our
source
promises
the
anti-yordle
request
is
sure
to
be
rejected
as
secretly
as
it
was
proposed,
the
fact
that
the
Witherwood
report
is
being
read
at
all
is
typical
of
predatory
Noxian
attitudes.
At
least
one
High
Command
officer
was
reported
saying,
&quot;Guess
we
better
use
more
magic,
so
its
not
our
children
turning
up
with
fur.&quot;
History
Professor
Josin
Darawee
of
the
Grand
Demacian
University
expressed
great
concern
over
the
Witherwood
report.
&quot;These
claims
are
preposterous!
Firstly,
five
minutes
study
of
history
proves
that
non-humans
have
existed
on
Runeterra
as
long
as
their
human
cousins.
Second,
to
imply
that
increased
sorcery
makes
its
users
MORE
safe
is
the
worst
kind
of
delusion,
an
attempt
to
turn
the
horrors
of
the
Rune
Wars
into
nothing
more
than
'well
hit
you
first!'
No
surprise
its
some
of
Noxus'
magical
weapons
consultants
that
'discovered'
it!&quot;
The
abuse
of
yordles
and
other
non-humans
in
Noxus
has
been
a
source
of
longtime
concern,
although
it
usually
takes
the
form
of
harsh
attitudes
on
the
Noxian
street
rather
than
official
pressure.
Away
from
the
city,
non-humans
such
as
the
Great
Barrier
minotaurs
have
historically
been
as
likely
as
humans
to
face
Noxian
raids.
Noxus'
small
community
of
non-humans,
mostly
visitors
to
the
city,
appeared
to
have
no
knowledge
of
the
Witherwood
report.
Yordles
in
particular
refused
to
comment,
although
several
that
were
interviewed
were
then
seen
rapidly
packing
their
belongings.
League
Champion
Katarina
,
speaking
on
behalf
of
Noxus,
denied
that
the
Witherwood
report
was
ever
made.
She
added,
&quot;Noxus
has
always
treated
every
contributing
member
as
fairly
as
they
deserve.
Really,
would
any
Noxian
official
even
leak
such
an
absurd
story
to
the
news,
or
expect
to
live
if
he
did?
Instead
of
repeating
obvious
Demacian
lies,
any
yordles
afraid
their
people
are
being
mistreated
in
Noxus
should
sign
up
for
our
northern
barbarian-pacification
campaign
to
remind
us
how
clever
those
little
hands
are
in
aiming
a
weapon.&quot;
UnaVoidable
Musings
(Believe
Me,
Ive
Tried)
Inquiries
regarding
the
Leagues
latest
oddballs
L.B.
Briskes
commenting
from
My
Living
Room
Any
good
sideshow
needs
its
freak,
right?
After
all,
without
bearded
ladies
and
three-armed
giants,
how
else
could
we
abide
calling
ourselves
normal?
Naturally,
when
the
peculiar
Cho'Gath
made
his
controversial
debut
in
the
League
of
Legends,
it
did
not
falter
my
derisive
scoff.
We've
certainly
seen
stranger
and
more
sensational
things
in
Valoran
.
When
Kassadin
arrived
with
his
amusing
doomsday
prophecies
and
mystically
purple
bag-of-tricks,
I
barely
paused
whilst
trimming
a
pesky
hangnail.
However,
the
advent
of
Malzahar

and
now
Kog'Maw

positively
jars
my
otherwise
blissful
contemptibility
with
uninvited
questions
concerning
their
allegedly
otherworldly
origins.
All
claim

some
vocally,
others
visually

to
have
traveled
from
the
malevolent,
ominous,
and
above
all,
spooky
Void.
Evidence
supporting
these
claims
varies
haphazardly
from
the
occasional
summoned
bug-critter
to
the
wanton
engorgement
of
man-
or
minotaur-sized
objects,
but
the
facts
seem
to
merit
a
moments
consideration.
Stories
of
the
Void
can
be
traced
back
to
the
lost
city
of
Icathia
,
a
place
with
about
as
much
proof
that
it
ever
existed
as
you
find
competitive
yordle
high-jumpers
(rockets
excluded,
cheaters).
The
believers
generally
agree
that
Icathia
was
located
in
the
Southern
half
of
Valoran
somewhere,
though
details
become
muddled
there.
Many
explorers
have
struck
out
to
discover
the
place,
but
the
only
fact
their
findings
universally
corroborate
is
that
just
about
everywhere
south
of
the
Great
Barrier
is
malevolent,
ominous,
and
spooky.
The
absence
of
evidence
is
not
the
evidence
of
absence,
but
surely
after
so
very
many
forays
into
the
southern
wilds,
someone
would
have
found
some
lingering
scrap
of
an
entire
civilization,
right?
Well
that
discounts
the
appreciable
number
of
pioneers
who
have
never
returned.
Furthermore,
the
fringe
Void
fanatics
submit
theories
of
magical
intervention,
citing
cases
in
which
explorers
have
reported
time
discrepancies
from
their
travels,
as
though
days
were
stolen.
I
have
experienced
similar
time
discrepancies
myself,
and
in
the
following
mornings
I
often
find
empty
bottles
or
glasses
that
I
swore
were
full
the
night
before.
Intrepid
journalist
that
I
am,
I
ventured
to
Summoner's
Rift
after
an
exhibition
match
for
any
comment
from
the
aforementioned
champions
which
would
quell
this
nagging
curiosity
and
restore
the
apathy
Ive
come
to
enjoy.
Cho'Gaths
and
Kog'Maw's
comments
were
tantamount
to
projectile
vomit,
both
in
eloquence
and
relevance...also
literally.
Malzahar
only
grinned
in
the
sort
of
manner
Ive
come
to
expect
from
serial
killers
and
postmen,
promising
that
Ill
&quot;soon
learn
everything
I
need
to
know.&quot;
Though
I
never
mentioned
my
investigations
of
formulas
to
sterilize
people
afflicted
by
idiocy,
I
do
hope
he
is
correct.
Kassadin
offered
perhaps
the
most
insightful
response,
stating,
&quot;You
do
not
understand
that
which
you
seek.&quot;
He
provided
further
useful
information,
&quot;Cho'Gath
and
Kog'Maw
cannot
be
trusted.&quot;
My
spittle-soaked
boots
wish
Id
conducted
this
interview
first.
So
laden
with
this
deluge
of
knowledge,
Ill
leave
you
as
informed
as
you
were
prior
to
reading
my
article,
which
I
can
only
assume
means
that
-
if
Malzahar
is
truly
correct
-
youll
also
have
an
inoculation
coming.
The
Loyal
Heart
Beats
Eternal
A
commentary
on
Noxian
philosophy,
service,
and
League
Champion
Sion
Richor
Ebony
commenting
from
Noxus
It
has
been
said
that
as
one
ascends
to
power,
one
loses
friends.
While
one
can
debate
the
merits
of
humility
until
the
sun
hangs
low
in
the
sky,
suffice
to
say
it
is
no
secret
that
my
homeland,
the
principality
of
Noxus,
has
acquired
more
than
its
fair
share
of
partisans
over
the
years.
Regardless
of
your
personal
feelings
towards
the
High
Command,
however,
there
are
few
who
could
challenge
our
dedication
to
the
loyal.
For
the
sake
of
illustration,
allow
me
to
cite
the
example
of
the
Noxian
warrior
known
as
Sion
.
A
staunch
supporter
of
our
Eternal
General,
as
well
as
a
soldier
of
high
regard,
Sions
fervor
on
the
field
before
his
accident
carried
him
to
victory
in
many
battles.
His
fame
and
renown
spread
to
the
far
corners
of
Valoran,
and
even
where
his
name
was
not
revered,
it
was
rightfully
feared.
It
could
be
said
that
the
very
quality
that
made
this
warriors
career
also
brought
it
to
its
end.
Sion
zealously
engaged
a
Demacian
force
that
was
a
bit
too
well-entrenched

even
for
a
warrior
of
his
considerable
skill.
He
was
captured
and
executed.
His
body
was
sent
back
to
Demacia
as
an
accolade
to
the
so-called
justice
of
King
Jarvan
III.
But
respect
for
the
dead
takes
many
forms,
and
Noxus
does
not
so
easily
abandon
its
own
to
adorn
the
battlements
of
an
insolent
enemy
in
tribute
to
foreign
law.
Galvanized
by
their
champions
heroic
death,
the
assassins
of
Noxus

under
the
command
of
Katarina,
the
famed
Sinister
Blade

undertook
a
dangerous
mission
to
recover
Sions
mortal
remains.
The
Demacian
propaganda
machine
may
try
to
spin
whatever
fantastic
story
it
wishes;
our
successful
venture
is
plainly
now
a
matter
of
public
record.
In
Noxus,
for
a
true
soldier,
death
does
not
have
to
be
the
end.
The
necromancers
of
the
Bleak
Academy
have
ways
of
preserving
the
ardent.
Within
Sions
still
heart,
that
same
rage

that
same
glorious
fervor
that
had
made
him
the
unstoppable
juggernaut
he
was
in
life

still
burned.
Even
now,
Sion
serves
Noxus.
He
shall
always
serve
Noxus

an
eternal
champion
of
our
banner,
stalwartly
defending
the
interests
of
the
state
on
the
Field
of
Justice.
This
is
his
just
reward
for
a
life
of
dedication
to
the
advancement
of
the
Empire,
and
to
the
glory
of
the
High
Command.
This
is
any
true
Noxian
loyalists
ultimate
reward.
Forever
strong!
