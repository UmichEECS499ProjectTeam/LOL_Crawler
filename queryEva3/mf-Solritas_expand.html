PENDING
FOR
TEST
Impure
Shots'
relationship
with
dodge
,
parry
,
block
and
blind
has
yet

tested.
The
bonus

Lifeline
.
Spell
shields
will
not
block
the

Additional
Information:
The
stacks
of
Impure
Shots
accumulate
on
the
target,
and
are
not
reset
if
Miss
Fortune
attacks
a
new
target.
This
is
unlike
similar
effects,
such
as
Clockwork
Windup
and
Eternal
Thirst
,
which
accumulate
on
the
champion
and
reset
whenever
they
attack
a
new
target.

Friends
&amp;
Rivals
Champion
For
those
who
brave
the
harsh
seas
of
Runeterra
,
attaining
ones
own
ship
and
crew
is
the
pinnacle
of
success.
Sarah
Fortune,
a
well-respected
(some
would
say
legendary)
bounty
hunter
from
Bilgewater
,
was
able
to
achieve
this
feat
just
after
her
sixteenth
birthday,
etching
out
her
name
as
the
go-to
gal
for
resolving
special
troubles.
No
bounty
was
too
difficult
or
too
dangerous
for
her
feminine
charm
and
her
renowned
use
of
her
twin
pistols,
&quot;Shock
and
Awe&quot;.
Her
success
gave
her
the
means
to
legitimately
purchase
her
own
ship
-
with
a
little
flirtatious
haggling,
of
course.
Things
werent
always
so
fortunate
for
Miss
Fortune,
though.
When
she
was
young,
trade
ships
began
to
dot
the
horizon
of
her
quiet
home
along
the
northern
shores
of
Blue
Flame
Island's
largest
chunk.
Trade
routes
brought
piracy,
and
the
inhabitants
soon
found
themselves
caught
in
a
frenzy
of
pillage.
One
day,
young
Sarah
returned
home
to
hear
gunshots
and
screaming.
Her
front
door
was
smashed
open;
inside,
she
saw
her
mother
lying
in
a
pool
of
blood.
A
sudden
blow
to
her
head
made
her
collapse
next
to
her
slain
mother.
The
last
thing
she
could
remember
were
her
attackers
red
eyes,
as
his
face
was
blocked
by
a
rogues
bandanna.
Miss
Fortune
has
a
strong
distrust
for
pirates
and
she
finds
herself
constantly
bickering
with
the
infamous
Gangplank
(the
only
captain
to
resist
her
charms)
over
the
direction
of
Bilgewater
politics.
Her
two
goals:
to
unite
the
people
of
Bilgewater,
making
them
into
a
strong
and
independent
society,
and
to
find
the
pirate
who
killed
her
mother.
To
that
end,
she
has
entered
the
League
of
Legends
as
a
champion
,
trading
her
skills
for
the
wealth
and
influence
that
will
help
her
accomplish
both.
&quot;More
men
have
voluntarily
surrendered
to
the
care
of
Miss
Fortune
than
any
other
bounty
hunter.&quot;

CLE
OBSERVATION
Miss
Fortune
spills
into
the
Great
Hallway
with
the
same
tenacity
that
she
spills
into
her
silk
blouse,
both
taxed
to
contain
her.
She
is
cramped
inside
any
structure
not
bobbing
across
the
salt
ocean.
Her
eyes
pan
across
the
recessed
ceilings
filigree
with
disdain,
the
toil
of
Valoran's
finest
artisans
a
pitiful
substitute
for
the
night
skys
celestial
collage.
The
disapproving
shake
of
her
head
would
be
imperceptible,
if
not
exaggerated
by
the
wag
of
her
ornamented
tricorne,
the
defining
accessory
of
a
captain.
An
avalanche
of
cherry
locks
tumbles
from
the
hat,
engulfing
her
shoulders
in
scarlet
waves.
Her
every
feature
seduces
attention,
a
weapon
as

or
perhaps
more

potent
than
the
enormous
gilded
muskets
clinging
to
her
hips.
She
bounds
across
the
tiles.
The
impact
of
every
footfall
ripples
up
the
curves
of
her
figure;
the
distraction
of
her
beauty
magnified
in
motion.
One
can
practically
see
the
hearts
of
those
whove
beheld
her
trailing
in
her
wake.
An
inscription
looms
overhead:
The
truest
opponent
lies
within.
The
corner
of
her
lips
twitch,
almost
a
smile.
With
uncanny
grace,
she
plucks
a
musket
from
its
holster,
twirls
it
once
round
her
finger
and
brings
it
to
rest
with
the
word
&quot;opponent&quot;
in
its
crosshair.
Her
lips
mouth
a
silent
pop,
and
the
firearm
is
re-holstered.
She
dawdles
no
longer.
REFLECTION
Hands
on
her
hips,
Miss
Fortune
tapped
her
foot
impatiently
in
the
dark.
This
was
a
juvenile
tactic.
If
the
League
resorted
to
gimmicks
like
black
smoke
for
its
trials,
perhaps
she
never
should
have
made
landfall.
Her
foot
sank
mid-thought.
She
intended
to
recoil,
but
a
familiar
sensation
pressed
her
on
all
sides.
She
didn't
hear
herself
cry,
but
she
watched
bubbles
carry
the
sound
away.
Water?
She
flailed,
her
limbs
searching
for
something
solid.
Yards
above,
she
saw
the
surfaces
dancing
prism
of
light.
She
paddled
furiously,
but
the
light
remained
distant
-
something
was
wrong.
More
bubbles.
The
skin
of
her
leg
crawled,
begging
attention.
Precious
air
waning,
she
risked
a
glance
and
found
the
problem.
Rooted
seaweed
clutched
her
ankle
tightly,
apparently
aware
of
its
catch.
She
tore
at
it,
but
its
slimy
grip
would
not
relent.
Out
of
time,
Sarah
Fortune
watched
the
last
bubbles
drift
merrily
upward,
growing
smaller
and
smaller,
until
salt
stung
her
lungs.
She
felt
strangely
peaceful
when
her
vision
faded.
I'm
on
my
way,
Mom.
Sarah's
sides
wrenched
in
misery.
A
torrent
poured
from
her
mouth.
Expecting
entrails,
she
pried
her
eyes
open.
She
grasped
for
focus;
the
escaping
deluge
lacked
the
visceral
color
she'd
expected.
Blurry
vines
framing
her
field
of
vision
coalesced
into
defeated
strands
of
hair,
dangling
limply
around
her
face.
Her
hands
dug
into
the
sand.
Her
mind
filled
the
gaps:
she
was
kneeling
on
the
beach
and
the
puddle
in
front
of
her
consisted
of
frothy
seawater,
as
opposed
to
innards.
Her
lungs,
battling
her
stomach,
forced
an
inhale
before
the
next
heave.
&quot;A
sure
ugly
sight
ye
be
fer
a
young
wench.
Thought
yeh
might
be
shark
bait
fer
a
turn.&quot;
A
sputter
of
briny
droplets
was
the
best
retort
Sarah
could
articulate.
Her
eyes
locked
on
the
source,
a
garish
boy,
and
she
fell
backward.
His
onyx
hair
and
leering
grin
were
unmistakable,
but
he
was
too
young.
&quot;How...&quot;
&quot;Ye
be
a
lucky
one.
I
was
huntin
fer
mermaids.
Fancy
me
letdown
when
I
spied
yer
kickers.&quot;
Her
breath
found
rhythm.
&quot;They
don't
disappoint
many.&quot;
&quot;They
got
some
shape
to
be
sure,
but
I
seen
better.&quot;
Sarah
stumbled
to
her
feet,
wet
clothes
matted
to
her
body.
&quot;There
are
none
better.&quot;
The
boy
chortled.
&quot;So
what
be
the
reward
fer
fishin
ye
from
the
drink?&quot;
&quot;Thanks?&quot;
&quot;A
fine
thanks
Ill
wager,
but
no
reward
I
assure
ye.&quot;
He
pointed
at
her
head.
How
bout
at?
She
touched
her
hair,
and
her
fingers
grasped
a
smooth
object.
She
extracted
a
pearlescent
comb,
fashioned
from
a
conch.
Mothers
comb?
She
examined
it
dubiously;
an
epiphany
clawed
at
the
back
of
her
mind.
She
opened
her
mouth,
but
before
she
could
speak,
the
boy
closed
the
distance
and
stole
a
lingering
kiss.
Her
nagging
subconscious
burst,
realization
surging
forth.
This
beach,
this
boy...the
day
her
mother
died.
She'd
wandered
from
her
house,
drenched
in
her
mothers
blood.
Wading
into
the
surf,
she
was
vaguely
aware
of
the
crimson
wisps
stretching
from
her
garments.
She
dipped
below
the
surface
and
screamed,
attempting
to
shock
her
mind
back
to
rationality.
Beneath
the
waves,
her
tears
either
joined
or
comprised
the
ocean
around
her,
she
couldnt
tell.
That
day,
the
boy
was
waiting
on
the
banks.
Under
other
circumstances,
shed
have
wondered
how
long
he
had
been
there;
she
may
have
even
blushed.
But
she
only
stared,
too
exhausted
to
ponder
his
presence.
His
mouth
moved,
but
her
ears
denied
the
sound.
Then
he
joined
her
amongst
the
waves
and
kissed
her,
a
confounding
loop
added
to
the
dizzying
course
of
her
emotions.
He
pulled
away
with
her
mothers
comb
in
hand,
cackling.
One
day
hed
make
a
ruthless
pirate.
Prize
in
tow,
he
sauntered
off,
jack
boots
stamping
the
sand.
He
turned
once,
comb
held
high,
and
bellowed,
Come
an
get
it!
He
then
laughed,
disappearing
beneath
black
sails
which
dotted
the
distant
shoreline.
Strangely
inspired,
Sarah
welled
with
new
found
purpose.
Once
she'd
buried
her
mother,
and
burned
her
house
to
the
ground,
she
would
enjoy
getting
her
comb
back.
As
the
memory
receded,
Miss
Fortune
jerked
away
from
the
boys
embrace.
Who
are
you?!
Why
do
you
want
to
join
the
League,
Miss
Fortune?
The
seadog
timbre
was
gone.
What?
Why
do
you
want
to
join
the
League?
I...for
power
and
plunder.
She
doubted
her
own
words.
Why
do
you
want
to
join
the
League?
Frost
bit
every
syllable.
Crashing
waves
filled
the
silence.
I
need
to
find
him.
How
does
it
feel,
exposing
your
mind?
Miss
Fortune
let
his
inquiry
hang
in
the
air.
Drowned
and
drained,
questions
brimming,
she
felt
somehow
revitalized.
Thank
you.
Light
filled
her
view,
and
the
hallway
beckoned.
The
marble
doors
behind
her
offered
retreat.
She
laughed
at
the
thought.
No
matter
what,
Miss
Fortune
always
gets
her
man.

Announcement
made
in

by

With
the
recent
increase
in
ninja
population
at
the
Institute
of
War,
there
has
been
some
PR
backlash
amongst
pirate
enthusiasts.
For
those
like
myself,
who
proudly
sail
under
the
Black
Flag,
Riot
Games
has
asked
me
to
inform
you
that
you
have
not
been
forgotten!
Every
scurvy
dog
has
his
day,
and
very
soon,
you
shall
have
yours!
To
appease
these
constituents,
we
have
our
latest
pirate
champion
coming
up!
Her
name
is
Miss
Fortune,
the
Bounty
Hunter,
and
shes
got
everything
a
lady
buccaneer
should
offer.
I
mean,
just
check
out
the
pair
on
her!
Those
are
some
seriously
huge,
enormous,
titanic
pistols
shes
got
there!
Thats
right,
pistols.
What
did
you
think
I
was
talking
about?
So
start
getting
excited!
Miss
Fortune
will
be
sailing
into
your
port,

Trivia
Miss
Fortune
was
designed
by
Geeves
.
Sarah
Fortune
is
her
real
name,
Miss
Fortune
is
made
to
sound
like
misfortune.
This
relates
to
the
old
sailor
myth
that
women
on
ships
were
bad
luck.
Her
Ultimate's
name,
Bullet
Time
,
is
based
off
of
a
term
used
in
movies
in
which
all
action
goes
into
slow-motion,
a
term
coined
by
the
Max
Payne
video
game
franchise.
Her
matched
pistols
('Shock'
and
'Awe')
are
a
reference
to
a
military
tactic
which
dictates
the
use
of
overwhelming
firepower
and
battlefield
awareness
to
drain
the
enemy's
will
to
fight
back.
Miss
Fortune
was
one
of
the
champions
available
to
be
chosen
for
the
Noxian
pool
during
the
2nd
Ionia
vs.
Noxus
match
.
She
was
one
of
the
selected
champions.
Miss
Fortune
could
be
a
reference
to
Rue
Meridian
from
&quot;The
Voyage
of
the
Jerle
Shannara&quot;
books
by
Terry
Brooks.
Rue
Meridian
is
an
airship
crew
member/mercenary
that
&quot;is
capable
of
charming
any
man&quot;.
They
are
also
visually
similar.
Gangplank
may
be
visually
based
off
her
brother,
a
captain
of
the
ship.
Her
twin
pistols
can
be
seen
in
the
Mac
Version
Launch
preview
video
for
League
of
Legends.
Miss
Fortune
appearance
in
her
classic
looks
is
somewhat
similar
to
Elza
from
Final
Fantasy
XII:
Revenant
Wings.
Elza,
like
Miss
Fortune,
is
also
a
pirate(sky
pirate
actually),
wears
rather
revealing
attire
and
equips
guns
which
the
barrel
have
larger
circumference
at
the
muzzle.
Quotes
Miss
Fortune's
selection
quote:
&quot;Fortune
doesn't
favor
fools!&quot;
is
likely
a
spin-off
of
the
latin
saying:
&quot;Fortuna
favet
fortis&quot;,
which
translates
to
&quot;Fortune
favors
the
brave.&quot;
Some
of
her
quotes
are
direct
references
to
Han
Solo
from
Star
Wars
A
New
Hope
.
&quot;I
always
shoot
first&quot;
:
Refers
to
Han's
shoot-out
with
Greedo
.
&quot;Don't
get
cocky&quot;
:
A
famous
Han
Solo
quote.
&quot;I've
got
a
good
feeling
about
this&quot;
:
Han
uses
a
similar
phrase
.
&quot;Watch
your
mouth
kid,
or
you'll
find
yourself
respawning
at
home!&quot;
:
An
adapted
version
of
one
of
Han's
lines.
The
French
Taunt
is
a
reference
to
the
movie
&quot;The
Good,
the
bad
and
the
Ugly&quot;.
Skins
The
pose
she
is
in
for
her
old
Classic
skin
artwork
resembles
the
Captain
Morgan
pose.
A
poster
of
her
in
her
classic
skin
has
&quot;Work
Hard&quot;
written
at
the
bottom
in
the
Mac
Launch
preview.
Waterloo
Miss
Fortune
skin
is
a
reference
to
depictions
of
Napoleon
Bonaparte
at
the
time
of
the
&quot;
Battle
of
Waterloo
&quot;.
Waterloo
Miss
Fortune
and
Minuteman
Gangplank
skins
both
reference
historic
times
of
war.
Mafia
Miss
Fortune,
Gangster
Twitch
,
Mafia
Graves
and
Mafia
Jinx
share
a
Mafia
theme.
Secret
Agent
Miss
Fortune
gives
Miss
Fortune
a
modern
espionage
Femme
fatale
theme.
Secret
Agent
Miss
Fortune
resembles
the
character
of
Jessica
Rabbit
of
the
movie
&quot;Who
Framed
Roger
Rabbit?&quot;.
Secret
Agent
Miss
Fortune
skin
closely
resembles
Ada
Wong
of
Resident
Evil
Series
and
Anna
Williams
of
Tekken
Series.
The
background
in
the
second
Chinese
Secret
Agent
Miss
Fortune
splash
art
alludes
to
the
night
street
scenes
found
in
Hong
Kong
Island
and
Kowloon
.
One
of
the
neon
bulletins
in
the
background,
,
translates
to
&quot;
Doran
weapon
workshop&quot;.
The
bulletin
in
the
top-right
corner
has
an
image
of
Janna
.
The
pose
is
the
same
she
has
in
her
Tempest
Janna
Chinese
splash
art.
In
the
Chinese
Art
for
her
Cowgirl
Miss
Fortune
skin,
you
can
see
a
poster
to
the
left,
declaring
Bandito
Fiddlesticks
wanted.
The
name
of
the
Road
Warrior
Miss
Fortune
skin
may
have
been
inspired
by
the
movie
Mad
Max
2:
The
Road
Warrior.
Her
Road
Warrior
Miss
Fortune
skin
closely
resembles
the

Trivia
Miss
Fortune
was
designed
by
Geeves
.
Sarah
Fortune
is
her
real
name,
Miss
Fortune
is
made
to
sound
like
misfortune.
This
relates
to
the
old
sailor
myth
that
women
on
ships
were
bad
luck.
Her
Ultimate's
name,
Bullet
Time
,
is
based
off
of
a
term
used
in
movies
in
which
all
action
goes
into
slow-motion,
a
term
coined
by
the
Max
Payne
video
game
franchise.
Her
matched
pistols
('Shock'
and
'Awe')
are
a
reference
to
a
military
tactic
which
dictates
the
use
of
overwhelming
firepower
and
battlefield
awareness
to
drain
the
enemy's
will
to
fight
back.
Miss
Fortune
was
one
of
the
champions
available
to
be
chosen
for
the
Noxian
pool
during
the
2nd
Ionia
vs.
Noxus
match
.
She
was
one
of
the
selected
champions.
Miss
Fortune
could
be
a
reference
to
Rue
Meridian
from
&quot;The
Voyage
of
the
Jerle
Shannara&quot;
books
by
Terry
Brooks.
Rue
Meridian
is
an
airship
crew
member/mercenary
that
&quot;is
capable
of
charming
any
man&quot;.
They
are
also
visually
similar.
Gangplank
may
be
visually
based
off
her
brother,
a
captain
of
the
ship.
Her
twin
pistols
can
be
seen
in
the
Mac
Version
Launch
preview
video
for
League
of
Legends.
Miss
Fortune
appearance
in
her
classic
looks
is
somewhat
similar
to
Elza
from
Final
Fantasy
XII:
Revenant
Wings.
Elza,
like
Miss
Fortune,
is
also
a
pirate(sky
pirate
actually),
wears
rather
revealing
attire
and
equips
guns
which
the
barrel
have
larger
circumference
at
the
muzzle.
Quotes
Miss
Fortune's
selection
quote:
&quot;Fortune
doesn't
favor
fools!&quot;
is
likely
a
spin-off
of
the
latin
saying:
&quot;Fortuna
favet
fortis&quot;,
which
translates
to
&quot;Fortune
favors
the
brave.&quot;
Some
of
her
quotes
are
direct
references
to
Han
Solo
from
Star
Wars
A
New
Hope
.
&quot;I
always
shoot
first&quot;
:
Refers
to
Han's
shoot-out
with
Greedo
.
&quot;Don't
get
cocky&quot;
:
A
famous
Han
Solo
quote.
&quot;I've
got
a
good
feeling
about
this&quot;
:
Han
uses
a
similar
phrase
.
&quot;Watch
your
mouth
kid,
or
you'll
find
yourself
respawning
at
home!&quot;
:
An
adapted
version
of
one
of
Han's
lines.
The
French
Taunt
is
a
reference
to
the
movie
&quot;The
Good,
the
bad
and
the
Ugly&quot;.
Skins
The
pose
she
is
in
for
her
old
Classic
skin
artwork
resembles
the
Captain
Morgan
pose.
A
poster
of
her
in
her
classic
skin
has
&quot;Work
Hard&quot;
written
at
the
bottom
in
the
Mac
Launch
preview.
Waterloo
Miss
Fortune
skin
is
a
reference
to
depictions
of
Napoleon
Bonaparte
at
the
time
of
the
&quot;
Battle
of
Waterloo
&quot;.
Waterloo
Miss
Fortune
and
Minuteman
Gangplank
skins
both
reference
historic
times
of
war.
Mafia
Miss
Fortune,
Gangster
Twitch
,
Mafia
Graves
and
Mafia
Jinx
share
a
Mafia
theme.
Secret
Agent
Miss
Fortune
gives
Miss
Fortune
a
modern
espionage
Femme
fatale
theme.
Secret
Agent
Miss
Fortune
resembles
the
character
of
Jessica
Rabbit
of
the
movie
&quot;Who
Framed
Roger
Rabbit?&quot;.
Secret
Agent
Miss
Fortune
skin
closely
resembles
Ada
Wong
of
Resident
Evil
Series
and
Anna
Williams
of
Tekken
Series.
The
background
in
the
second
Chinese
Secret
Agent
Miss
Fortune
splash
art
alludes
to
the
night
street
scenes
found
in
Hong
Kong
Island
and
Kowloon
.
One
of
the
neon
bulletins
in
the
background,
,
translates
to
&quot;
Doran
weapon
workshop&quot;.
The
bulletin
in
the
top-right
corner
has
an
image
of
Janna
.
The
pose
is
the
same
she
has
in
her
Tempest
Janna
Chinese
splash
art.
In
the
Chinese
Art
for
her
Cowgirl
Miss
Fortune
skin,
you
can
see
a
poster
to
the
left,
declaring
Bandito
Fiddlesticks
wanted.
The
name
of
the
Road
Warrior
Miss
Fortune
skin
may
have
been
inspired
by
the
movie
Mad
Max
2:
The
Road
Warrior.
Her
Road
Warrior
Miss
Fortune
skin
closely
resembles
the
post-apocalyptic
clothing
worn
by
people
in
the
same
movie.
The
sawed-off
double
barrel
shotgun
design
for
the
skin
might
have
been
inpired
by
Max
Rockatansky's
sawed-off
double
barrel
shotgun
from
the
same
movie.
Relations
Miss
Fortune
is
searching
for
the
person
who
killed
her
mother,
a
man
with
red
eyes.
Miss
Fortune
has
a
strong
distrust
for
pirates
and
she
finds
herself
constantly
bickering
with
the
infamous
Gangplank
(the
only
captain
to
resist
her
charms)
over
the
direction
of
Bilgewater
politics.
Miss
Fortune
defeated
Gangplank
in
the
Bilgewater
GrugMug
Grog
Slog
competition.

Skill
usage
Miss
Fortune
ramps
up
movement
speed
with
her
passive
Strut
if
she
isn't
attacked
by
an
enemy
unit.
Avoid
getting
hit
to
keep
her
passive.
This
is
an
exceptional
passive
when
it
comes
to
reaching
lanes
or
closing
distances
fast,
such
as
crossing
lanes
to
support
or
gank.
Use
Double
Up
to
harass
enemy
champions.
Casting
it
on
an
enemy
minion
or
champion
if
an
enemy
champion
are
behind
them
will
result
in
it
bouncing
off
towards
them
for
extra
damage.
Double
Up
can
hit
enemies
in
bushes,
even
without
vision.
Use
this
to
your
advantage
by
bouncing
it
off
a
visible
minion/enemy
champion,
in
the
champion's
vicinity.
You
can
activate
Impure
Shots
while
a
Double
Up
shot
is
in
the
air
and
it
will
still
apply
the
debuff
on
hit.
Use
Impure
Shots
to
attack
opponents
that
have
high
health
regeneration,
lifesteal
or
healing
such
as
from
spells
or
items.
The
Grievous
Wounds
debuff
from
Impure
Shots
will
reduce
their
ability
to
heal
and
potentially
get
you
an
easier
kill
because
of
the
effect.
Activate
Impure
Shots
to
take
down
turrets
quicker.
Miss
Fortune
's
abilities
allow
her
to
clear
minions
faster
than
many
other

but
needs
to
farm
a

of
gold
in

to
be
successful
against

Rain
can
and
should
be
used
all
game
to
farm
weak
groups
of
minions.
Bullet
Time
will
instantly
destroy
even
large
groups
of
minions,
but
it
is
usually
better
to
save
it
for
team-fights
due
to
its
long
cooldown,
unless
a
tower
or
inhibitor
is
in
severe
danger
from
minion
waves.
Make
It
Rain
slows
enemy
units,
including
champions.
Use
it
to
prevent
low-health
enemy
champions
from
escaping
and
get
your
teammates
an
extra
kill,
or
fire
it
behind
you
while
running
(with
caution)
to
slow
enemy
pursuers.
Make
It
Rain
has
a
noticeable
cast
time
when
activated,
so
be
cautious
using
it
when
running
away
from
an
opponent.
You
can
compensate
for
the
loss
of
movement
by
using
Ghost
or
Flash
.
Make
It
Rain
provides
sight
when
it
is
activated,
so
use
it
on
brush
or
gank
spots
to
avoid
being
ganked.
Use
Make
It
Rain
before
using
Bullet
Time
to
keep
your
enemies
in
Bullet
Time
's
area
of
effect.
Bullet
Time
is
able
to
go
through
walls;
use
it
to
surprise
tower-hugging
enemies.
Also,
take
advantage
of
an
ally
stun
or
snare,
like
Curse
of
the
Sad
Mummy
or
Dazzle
Bullet
Time
is
a
channeling
ability,
so
a
stun
or
a
silence
can
interrupt
it.
Be
sure
that
you
are
out
of
range
to
enemy
champions
with
Crowd
Control
while
casting
Bullet
Time
so
that
it
can
not
be
interrupted.
All
of
Miss
Fortune
's
abilities
are
strongest
in
mid
game.
Bullet
Time
is
almost
unstoppable
at
level
6.
By
level
18,
it
will
hardly
scratch
most
enemies.
Use
her
timing
effectively
by
pushing
hard
in
mid-game
so
that
Miss
Fortune
is
prepared
for
the
item-heavy
endgame
she
needs.
Her
ultimate
is
great
for
stealing
Baron.
Build
usage
Miss
Fortune
is
a
team-oriented
Marksman
that
can
be
played
in
different
ways,
offering
her
team
an
array
of
options
few
other
Marksmen
can
match
with
superb
damage.
In
exchange,
she
trades
any
escape
mechanism
and
safety,
making
her
very
vulnerable
during
team
fights
and,
overall,
an
easy
target
to
focus.
Offense:
Being
a
strong
bully
in
lane,
Miss
Fortune
benefits
from
attack
damage
greatly.
Sometimes
a
Doran's
Blade
or
two
can
set
her
ahead
due
to
sustain
and
bonus
health.
Given
her
natural
dominance
in
the
early
stage
of
the
game,
any
small
lead
can
become
a
big
advantage
for
Miss
Fortune
.
An
early
The
Brutalizer
can
be
very
powerful
on
Miss
Fortune
,
as
Double
Up
scales
very
well
with
attack
damage
,
it
provides
armor
penetration,
and
useful
cool
down
reduction.
It
also
builds
into
The
Black
Cleaver
later
on.
Because
of
her
back-line
nature,
The
Bloodthirster
works
very
well
as
Miss
Fortune
's
first
big
item.
The
bonus
AD
is
great
on
her
and
the
sustain
is
essential.
A
common
strategy
is
to
build
around
Bullet
Time
by
getting
a
The
Black
Cleaver
in
combination
with
Last
Whisper
;
start
a
team
fight
with
a
heavy
AoE
CC
or
lock-down
move
and
unleash
Bullet
Time
.
Since
it
deals
physical
damage
in
such
a
large
cone,
it
applies
The
Black
Cleaver
stacks
very
quickly
to
all
the
targets
hit.
This
can
cause
massive
armor
shred
and
damage
in
the
first
seconds
of
a
fight,
giving
Miss
Fortune
and
her
team
great
advantage.
Miss
Fortune
can
be
built
as
a
conventional
Marksman
with
Phantom
Dancer
and
Infinity
Edge
combo,
focusing
on
sustained
damage
rather
than
AoE
burst.
increases
her
attack
speed
substantially,
making
the
combo
even
deadlier.
Blade
of
the
Ruined
King
is
another
good
item
if
you
are
focusing
on
sustained
damage,
and
being
particularly
effective
against
high
health
targets.
It's
important
for
Miss
Fortune
to
have
enough
armor
penetration
and
attack
speed
in
order
to
maximize
its
value.
Defense:
Being
one
of
the
less
mobile
Marksmen
once
in
battle,
a
Banshee's
Veil
can
prevent
or
at
least
deter
enemies
from
spending
a
valuable
spell
on
Miss
Fortune
.
Preferred
against
teams
with
very
few
important
crowd
control
spells
or
large
nukes.
Alternatively,
a
Quicksilver
Sash
can
provide
magic
resistance
an
the
ability
to
remove
powerful
crowd
control
spells
for
lock
down.
Plus,
it
can
later
be
built
into
Mercurial
Scimitar
,
which
provide
the
same
benefits
and
a
substantial
AD
increase.
Another
common
pick
for
Marksmen
is
Guardian
Angel
,
which
makes
Miss
Fortune
less
attractive
as
a
primary
target.
However,
beware;
roaming
and
dying
to
enemies
when
teammates
are
at
distance
renders
Guardian
Angel
's
passive
useless.
Hexdrinker
is
another
good
early
pick,
albeit
not
common
on
Marksmen.
It
helps
by
defending
against
strong
magic
damage
nukes
like
Veigar's
Primordial
Burst
and
preventing
spells
like
Karthus's
Requiem
from
finishing
Miss
Fortune
off.
Also,
it
can
be
upgraded
to
Maw
of
Malmortius
later
on,
providing
even
more
AD.
Large
health
items
like
Frozen
Mallet
and
Warmog's
Armor
are
not
considered
optimal
as
they
can
be
easily
countered
by
health
shredding
items.
Furthermore,
the
lack
of
resistances
weakens
the
value
of
raw
health.
With
that
said,
Frozen
Mallet
can
become
a
great
chasing
tool
if
paired
with
Enchantment
-
Furor
,
Make
It
Rain
,
and
Impure
Shots
.
Another
unconventional
choice
for
Marksmen
is
Randuin's
Omen
.
This
item
should
be
considered
however,
when
the
enemy
team
has
strong
threats
that
rely
on
auto
attacking
such
as
bruisers
and
enemy
marksmen.
A
Zephyr
can
be
bought
later
in
the
game
to
replace
boots.
It
provides
many
useful
stats.
Miscellaneous:
Although
it
is
not
often
considered,
Trinity
Force
has
great
synergy
with
Miss
Fortune
as
it
amplifies
the
damage
of
Double
Up
's
first
hit
substantially,
as
well
as
provides
ability
power
to
increase
the
damage
of
her
other
skills.
It
also
gives
her
more
movement
speed
than
most
other
items,
as
well
as
attack
damage,
ability
power,
health
and
mana.
Not
to
mention
the
Rage
passive
will
allow
Miss
Fortune
to
move
much
quicker
than
she
normally
does
when
catching
up
to
enemy
champions.
Cooldown
reduction
would
be
recommended
in
order
to
get
the
most
out
of
the
build.
Due
to
the
nature
of
her
kit,
Miss
Fortune
can
build
through
several
paths
and
still
be
viable.
Some
items
like
Runaan's
Hurricane
and
Wit's
End
have
limited
yet
realistic
potential;
Miss
Fortune
can
either
apply
healing
reduction
to
up
to
three
targets
or
slowly
shred
their
magic
resistance.
A
Boots
of
Mobility
with
Statikk
Shiv
,
Zephyr
and
Trinity
Force
will
give
Miss
Fortune
a
total
of
544
movement
speed
with
Strut
.
This
build
can
be
considered
for
moving
around
the
map
very
quickly,
however
it
sacrifices
some
of
her
damage
output.
Trinity
Force
also
has
the
Rage
passive
and
combined
with
Enchantment
-
Furor
allows
her
to
chase
opponents
very
well.
Most
of
Miss
Fortune
's
abilities
provide
AP
ratios
as
well,
so
an
AP
build
can
be
used
with
pleasing
results.
Although
not
considered
viable
at
a
competitive
level,
the
build
can
still
deal
good
damage
with
reasonable
results.
Since
Double
Up
procs
and
applies
on-hit
effects,
a
Lich
Bane
can
be
useful
when
building
AP,
although
it
only
scales
with
AD.
Nashor's
Tooth
provides
a
small
ratio
on
auto
attacks,
which
would
stack
with
Impure
Shots
'
passive
and
active.
A
Liandry's
Torment
can
fully
benefit
from
its
passive
due
to
Make
It
Rain
.
Despite
being
considered
as
&quot;hybrid&quot;
items,
Guinsoo's
Rageblade
and
Hextech
Gunblade
can
be
fairly
effective
when
stacking
AP.

Countering
Miss
Fortune
is
a
rather
squishy
champion
like
most
other
ranged
AD
carries;
pressuring
her
in
lane
will
minimize
her
utility.
Miss
Fortune
has
no
escaping
abilities
besides
her
Strut
.
Harassing
her
frequently
will
minimize
the
effect
of
her
passive.
If
Miss
Fortune
is
hit
by
any
source
of
damage,
Strut
is
immediately
removed,
use
this
as
an
advantage
as
it
removes
her
mobility.
Quickly
move
away
from
Miss
Fortune's
Make
It
Rain
and
Bullet
Time
to
avoid
taking
damage.
However,
running
straight
backwards
from
Bullet
Time
can
often
be
one
of
the
worst
things
you
can
do,
because
it
has
a
long
range
and
a
widening
cone
-
move
sideways
or
even
towards
Miss
Fortune
if
at
melee
range
to
escape
Bullet
Time
fastest.
Before
using
healing
abilities,
wait
until
the
debuff
from
Miss
Fortune's
Impure
Shots
expires.
Bullet
Time
is
a
channeling
ability,
try
to
interrupt
Miss
Fortune
when
she
channels
it.
Like
Tristana
,
Miss
Fortune
has
some
magic
damage
abilities,
so
consider
building
MR/health
in
addition
to
straight
armor.
If
being
chased
by
Miss
Fortune
and
if
she
doesn't
have
Blessing
of
the
Lizard
Elder
or
Frozen
Mallet
,
landing
a
ranged
ability
or
auto
attack
will
act
as
a
slow
on
her
since
it
removes
Strut
long
enough
for
you
to
escape.

block
either
hit.

Details
Impure
Shots
is
an
on-hit
effect
and
self-targeted
buff
.
The
triggering
attacks
will
apply
other
on-hit
effects
and
can
critically
strike
as
normal.
Critical
strikes
do
not
interact
with
the
bonus
damage
of
Impure
Shots.
PENDING
FOR
TEST
Impure
Shots'
relationship
with
dodge
,
parry
,
block
and
blind
has
yet
to
be
tested.
The
bonus
damage
does
not
affect
structures.
Magic
damage
will
be
mitigated
by
Black
Shield
and
Lifeline
.
Spell
shields
will
not
block
the
damage
or
debuff.
Additional
Information:
The
stacks
of
Impure
Shots
accumulate
on
the
target,
and
are
not
reset
if
Miss
Fortune
attacks
a
new
target.
This
is
unlike
similar
effects,
such
as
Clockwork
Windup
and
Eternal
Thirst
,
which
accumulate
on
the
champion
and
reset
whenever
they
attack
a
new
target.

       For those who brave the harsh seas of Runeterra, attaining one's own ship and crew is the pinnacle of success. Sarah Fortune, a well-respected (some would say legendary) bounty hunter from Bilgewater, was able to achieve this feat just after her sixteenth birthday, etching out her name as the go-to gal for resolving special troubles. No bounty was too difficult or too dangerous for her feminine charm and her renowned use of her twin pistols, ''Shock and Awe''. Her success gave her the means to legitimately purchase her own ship... with a little flirtatious haggling, of course. Things weren't always so fortunate for Miss Fortune, though. When she was young, trade ships began to dot the horizon of her quiet home in the northern shores of Blue Flame Island's largest chunk. Trade routes brought piracy, and the inhabitants soon found themselves caught in a frenzy of pillage. One day, young Sarah returned home to hear gunshots and screaming. Her front door was smashed open; inside, she saw her mother lying in a pool of blood. A sudden blow to her head made her collapse next to her slain mother. The last thing she could remember were her attacker's red eyes, as his face was blocked by a rogue's bandana. Miss Fortune has a strong distrust for pirates and she finds herself constantly bickering with the infamous Gangplank (the only captain to resist her charms) over the direction of Bilgewater politics. Her two goals: to unite the people of Bilgewater, making them into a strong and independent society, and to find the pirate who killed her mother. To that end, she has entered the League of Legends as a champion, trading her skills for the wealth and influence that will help her accomplish both.

For
those
who
brave
the
harsh
seas
of
Runeterra
,
attaining
ones
own
ship
and
crew
is
the
pinnacle
of
success.
Sarah
Fortune,
a
well-respected
(some
would
say
legendary)
bounty
hunter
from
Bilgewater
,
was
able
to
achieve
this
feat
just
after
her
sixteenth
birthday,
etching
out
her
name
as
the
go-to
gal
for
resolving
special
troubles.
No
bounty
was
too
difficult
or
too
dangerous
for
her
feminine
charm
and
her
renowned
use
of
her
twin
pistols,
&quot;Shock
and
Awe&quot;.
Her
success
gave
her
the
means
to
legitimately
purchase
her
own
ship
-
with
a
little
flirtatious
haggling,
of
course.
Things
werent
always
so
fortunate
for
Miss
Fortune,
though.
When
she
was
young,
trade
ships
began
to
dot
the
horizon
of
her
quiet
home
along
the
northern
shores
of
Blue
Flame
Island's
largest
chunk.
Trade
routes
brought
piracy,
and
the
inhabitants
soon
found
themselves
caught
in
a
frenzy
of
pillage.
One
day,
young
Sarah
returned
home
to
hear
gunshots
and
screaming.
Her
front
door
was
smashed
open;
inside,
she
saw
her
mother
lying
in
a
pool
of
blood.
A
sudden
blow
to
her
head
made
her
collapse
next
to
her
slain
mother.
The
last
thing
she
could
remember
were
her
attackers
red
eyes,
as
his
face
was
blocked
by
a
rogues
bandanna.
Miss
Fortune
has
a
strong
distrust
for
pirates
and
she
finds
herself
constantly
bickering
with
the
infamous
Gangplank
(the
only
captain
to
resist
her
charms)
over
the
direction
of
Bilgewater
politics.
Her
two
goals:
to
unite
the
people
of
Bilgewater,
making
them
into
a
strong
and
independent
society,
and
to
find
the
pirate
who
killed
her
mother.
To
that
end,
she
has
entered
the
League
of
Legends
as
a
champion
,
trading
her
skills
for
the
wealth
and
influence
that
will
help
her
accomplish
both.
&quot;More
men
have
voluntarily
surrendered
to
the
care
of
Miss
Fortune
than
any
other
bounty
hunter.&quot;

CLE
OBSERVATION
Miss
Fortune
spills
into
the
Great
Hallway
with
the
same
tenacity
that
she
spills
into
her
silk
blouse,
both
taxed
to
contain
her.
She
is
cramped
inside
any
structure
not
bobbing
across
the
salt
ocean.
Her
eyes
pan
across
the
recessed
ceilings
filigree
with
disdain,
the
toil
of
Valoran's
finest
artisans
a
pitiful
substitute
for
the
night
skys
celestial
collage.
The
disapproving
shake
of
her
head
would
be
imperceptible,
if
not
exaggerated
by
the
wag
of
her
ornamented
tricorne,
the
defining
accessory
of
a
captain.
An
avalanche
of
cherry
locks
tumbles
from
the
hat,
engulfing
her
shoulders
in
scarlet
waves.
Her
every
feature
seduces
attention,
a
weapon
as

or
perhaps
more

potent
than
the
enormous
gilded
muskets
clinging
to
her
hips.
She
bounds
across
the
tiles.
The
impact
of
every
footfall
ripples
up
the
curves
of
her
figure;
the
distraction
of
her
beauty
magnified
in
motion.
One
can
practically
see
the
hearts
of
those
whove
beheld
her
trailing
in
her
wake.
An
inscription
looms
overhead:
The
truest
opponent
lies
within.
The
corner
of
her
lips
twitch,
almost
a
smile.
With
uncanny
grace,
she
plucks
a
musket
from
its
holster,
twirls
it
once
round
her
finger
and
brings
it
to
rest
with
the
word
&quot;opponent&quot;
in
its
crosshair.
Her
lips
mouth
a
silent
pop,
and
the
firearm
is
re-holstered.
She
dawdles
no
longer.
REFLECTION
Hands
on
her
hips,
Miss
Fortune
tapped
her
foot
impatiently
in
the
dark.
This
was
a
juvenile
tactic.
If
the
League
resorted
to
gimmicks
like
black
smoke
for
its
trials,
perhaps
she
never
should
have
made
landfall.
Her
foot
sank
mid-thought.
She
intended
to
recoil,
but
a
familiar
sensation
pressed
her
on
all
sides.
She
didn't
hear
herself
cry,
but
she
watched
bubbles
carry
the
sound
away.
Water?
She
flailed,
her
limbs
searching
for
something
solid.
Yards
above,
she
saw
the
surfaces
dancing
prism
of
light.
She
paddled
furiously,
but
the
light
remained
distant
-
something
was
wrong.
More
bubbles.
The
skin
of
her
leg
crawled,
begging
attention.
Precious
air
waning,
she
risked
a
glance
and
found
the
problem.
Rooted
seaweed
clutched
her
ankle
tightly,
apparently
aware
of
its
catch.
She
tore
at
it,
but
its
slimy
grip
would
not
relent.
Out
of
time,
Sarah
Fortune
watched
the
last
bubbles
drift
merrily
upward,
growing
smaller
and
smaller,
until
salt
stung
her
lungs.
She
felt
strangely
peaceful
when
her
vision
faded.
I'm
on
my
way,
Mom.
Sarah's
sides
wrenched
in
misery.
A
torrent
poured
from
her
mouth.
Expecting
entrails,
she
pried
her
eyes
open.
She
grasped
for
focus;
the
escaping
deluge
lacked
the
visceral
color
she'd
expected.
Blurry
vines
framing
her
field
of
vision
coalesced
into
defeated
strands
of
hair,
dangling
limply
around
her
face.
Her
hands
dug
into
the
sand.
Her
mind
filled
the
gaps:
she
was
kneeling
on
the
beach
and
the
puddle
in
front
of
her
consisted
of
frothy
seawater,
as
opposed
to
innards.
Her
lungs,
battling
her
stomach,
forced
an
inhale
before
the
next
heave.
&quot;A
sure
ugly
sight
ye
be
fer
a
young
wench.
Thought
yeh
might
be
shark
bait
fer
a
turn.&quot;
A
sputter
of
briny
droplets
was
the
best
retort
Sarah
could
articulate.
Her
eyes
locked
on
the
source,
a
garish
boy,
and
she
fell
backward.
His
onyx
hair
and
leering
grin
were
unmistakable,
but
he
was
too
young.
&quot;How...&quot;
&quot;Ye
be
a
lucky
one.
I
was
huntin
fer
mermaids.
Fancy
me
letdown
when
I
spied
yer
kickers.&quot;
Her
breath
found
rhythm.
&quot;They
don't
disappoint
many.&quot;
&quot;They
got
some
shape
to
be
sure,
but
I
seen
better.&quot;
Sarah
stumbled
to
her
feet,
wet
clothes
matted
to
her
body.
&quot;There
are
none
better.&quot;
The
boy
chortled.
&quot;So
what
be
the
reward
fer
fishin
ye
from
the
drink?&quot;
&quot;Thanks?&quot;
&quot;A
fine
thanks
Ill
wager,
but
no
reward
I
assure
ye.&quot;
He
pointed
at
her
head.
How
bout
at?
She
touched
her
hair,
and
her
fingers
grasped
a
smooth
object.
She
extracted
a
pearlescent
comb,
fashioned
from
a
conch.
Mothers
comb?
She
examined
it
dubiously;
an
epiphany
clawed
at
the
back
of
her
mind.
She
opened
her
mouth,
but
before
she
could
speak,
the
boy
closed
the
distance
and
stole
a
lingering
kiss.
Her
nagging
subconscious
burst,
realization
surging
forth.
This
beach,
this
boy...the
day
her
mother
died.
She'd
wandered
from
her
house,
drenched
in
her
mothers
blood.
Wading
into
the
surf,
she
was
vaguely
aware
of
the
crimson
wisps
stretching
from
her
garments.
She
dipped
below
the
surface
and
screamed,
attempting
to
shock
her
mind
back
to
rationality.
Beneath
the
waves,
her
tears
either
joined
or
comprised
the
ocean
around
her,
she
couldnt
tell.
That
day,
the
boy
was
waiting
on
the
banks.
Under
other
circumstances,
shed
have
wondered
how
long
he
had
been
there;
she
may
have
even
blushed.
But
she
only
stared,
too
exhausted
to
ponder
his
presence.
His
mouth
moved,
but
her
ears
denied
the
sound.
Then
he
joined
her
amongst
the
waves
and
kissed
her,
a
confounding
loop
added
to
the
dizzying
course
of
her
emotions.
He
pulled
away
with
her
mothers
comb
in
hand,
cackling.
One
day
hed
make
a
ruthless
pirate.
Prize
in
tow,
he
sauntered
off,
jack
boots
stamping
the
sand.
He
turned
once,
comb
held
high,
and
bellowed,
Come
an
get
it!
He
then
laughed,
disappearing
beneath
black
sails
which
dotted
the
distant
shoreline.
Strangely
inspired,
Sarah
welled
with
new
found
purpose.
Once
she'd
buried
her
mother,
and
burned
her
house
to
the
ground,
she
would
enjoy
getting
her
comb
back.
As
the
memory
receded,
Miss
Fortune
jerked
away
from
the
boys
embrace.
Who
are
you?!
Why
do
you
want
to
join
the
League,
Miss
Fortune?
The
seadog
timbre
was
gone.
What?
Why
do
you
want
to
join
the
League?
I...for
power
and
plunder.
She
doubted
her
own
words.
Why
do
you
want
to
join
the
League?
Frost
bit
every
syllable.
Crashing
waves
filled
the
silence.
I
need
to
find
him.
How
does
it
feel,
exposing
your
mind?
Miss
Fortune
let
his
inquiry
hang
in
the
air.
Drowned
and
drained,
questions
brimming,
she
felt
somehow
revitalized.
Thank
you.
Light
filled
her
view,
and
the
hallway
beckoned.
The
marble
doors
behind
her
offered
retreat.
She
laughed
at
the
thought.
No
matter
what,
Miss
Fortune
always
gets
her
man.

Announcement
made
in
the
sneak
peak
by
ByronicHero:
With
the
recent
increase
in
ninja
population
at
the
Institute
of
War,
there
has
been
some
PR
backlash
amongst
pirate
enthusiasts.
For
those
like
myself,
who
proudly
sail
under
the
Black
Flag,
Riot
Games
has
asked
me
to
inform
you
that
you
have
not
been
forgotten!
Every
scurvy
dog
has
his
day,
and
very
soon,
you
shall
have
yours!
To
appease
these
constituents,
we
have
our
latest
pirate
champion
coming
up!
Her
name
is
Miss
Fortune,
the
Bounty
Hunter,
and
shes
got
everything
a
lady
buccaneer
should
offer.
I
mean,
just
check
out
the
pair
on
her!
Those
are
some
seriously
huge,
enormous,
titanic
pistols
shes
got
there!
Thats
right,
pistols.
What
did
you
think
I
was
talking
about?
So
start
getting
excited!
Miss
Fortune
will
be
sailing
into
your
port,
soon!
