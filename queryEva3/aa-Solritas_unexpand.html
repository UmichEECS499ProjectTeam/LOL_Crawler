An
auto
attack
(also
called
standard
,
normal
,
or
basic
attack
)
is
the
attack
performed
by
a
champion
when
right-clicking
an
enemy
unit.
Auto
attacks
are
also
performed
by
an
idle
champion
when
an
enemy
unit
ventures
too
close
to
it,
or
when
the
&quot;attack
move&quot;
function
is
used
(default
Shift
+
right-click
).
Auto
attacks
are
also
performed
by
monsters
,
minions
and
turrets
.
Auto
attacking
can
be
disabled
from
in-game
interface
in
order
that
a
champion
won't
start
attacking
without
being
ordered
to.

Behavior
Champion
When
using
attack-move,
the
champion
stops
to
attack
any
hostile
that
gets
in
their
way
en-route
to
a
destination.
If
a
champion
has
an
attack
target,
they
will
continue
to
attack
it
if
in
range
and
will
move
closer
to
it
when
out
of
range,
until
either
a
new
target
is
specified,
a
cancel
order
is
issued
(pressing
the
S
key
or
by
specifying
another
move
order),
or
they
lose
vision
of
the
target.
Minions
Minions
will
automatically
attack
their
closest
target
by
default,
but
may
change
targets
in
a
similar
manner
to
turrets.
For
more
information
see
the
behavior
of
minions
page
.
Turrets
The
behavior
of
turrets
is
described
on
the
corresponding
page
as
well
as
the
damage
of
turrets
auto
attacks.
Turret
auto
attacks
differ
from
regular
auto
attacks
by
increasing
damage.
(Every
consecutive
turret
auto
attack
deals
slightly
more
damage
than
the
last)
Vision
Auto
attacking
while
hiding
in
brush
or
fog
of
war
will
reveal
the
attacking
unit,
and
if
in
brush
auto
attacking
will
reveal
allies
nearby
while
auto
attacking.
Damage
Auto
attacks
always
deal
physical
damage
unless
one
of
the
following
abilities
is
used,
in
which
case
the
whole
damage
of
the
auto
attack
will
be
magic
damage.
Mordekaiser's
Mace
of
Spades
Poppy's
Devastating
Blow
Twisted
Fate's
Pick
a
Card
However,
certain
items
,
abilities
or
passives
may
cause
them
to
deal
additional
magic
damage
on
top
of
their
base
physical
damage.
Damage
from
auto
attacks
benefits
from
the
attack
damage
stat
on
the
attacker
and
are
reduced
by
armor
on
the
target.
When
auto
attacking
a
turret
,
the
damage
is
based
on
the
base
attack
damage
added
to
either
the
bonus
attack
damage
or
40%
of
a
champion's
ability
power
,
depending
on
which
one
is
higher.
Even
though
it
may
use
an
ability
power
scaling
on
the
auto
attack,
it
still
is
entirely
physical
damage.
Attack
Speed
The
rate
at
which
a
champion
attacks
is
called
attack
speed
and
is
capped
at
2.
5
;
this
means
that
a
champion
can
attack
at
most,
5
times
in
a
2
second
period.
Some
abilities
refresh
the
attack
timer
and
allow
a
champion
to
attack
again
immediately
if
they
use
the
ability
after
their
auto
attack.

Certain
champion's
auto
attack
apply
a
dot
effect
on
their
target,
such
as:
Darius's
Hemorrhage
(
Innate
)
applies
a
stack
of
Hemorrhage,
up
to
a
maximum
of
5
stacks.
This
bleed

damage

Hemorrhage
deals

Grog
Soaked
Blade
(
Innate
)
applies
a
dot
for
3
seconds
that
can
stack
up
to
3
times.
Each
stack
deals
3
+
(1

level)
magic
damage
per
second
and
slows
the
target
by
7%.
Nautilus's
Titan's
Wrath
(
Ability
)
Nautilus
gains
a
shield
that
absorbs
a
certain
amount
of
damage.
The
shield
dissipates
after
10
seconds
if
not
already
destroyed.
While
the
shield
persists,
Nautilus's
basic
attacks
are
enhanced
to
debuff
all
enemies
within
175
range
of
his
target,
dealing
40
/
55
/
70
/
85
/
100
(+
40%
AP)
bonus
magic
damage
over
2
seconds.
This
debuff
refreshes
with
every
basic
attack.
Twitch's
Deadly
Venom
(
Innate
)
applies
a
stack
of
Deadly
Venom,
up
to
a
maximum
of
6
stacks.
This
dot
deals
2
/
4
/
6
/
8
true
damage
per
stack,
and
will
tick
once
per
second
for
6
seconds.
Fully
stacked,
Deadly
Venom
deals
12
/
24
/
36
/
48
true
damage
per
second
for
6
seconds.
Teemo's
Toxic
Shot
(
Ability
)
applies
a
poison
which
deals
magic
damage
per
second
equal
to
6
/
12
/
18
/
24
/
30
(+
30%
AP)
.
Subsequent
attacks
do
not
stack
the
poison,
but
refresh
the
duration.
References

This
ability
involves
a
casting
animation
which
delays
the
next
attack,
making
it
less
effective
in
increasing
attack
rate;
in
fact
it
may
decrease
attack
rate
if
the
champion's
attack
speed
is
sufficiently
high.

Archangel's
Staff
is
commonly
paired
with
Rod
of
Ages
for
many
ability
power
scaling
champions.
These
two
items
together
can
effectively
eliminate
any
champion's
mana
problems
and
the
early
Tear
of
the
Goddess
and
Catalyst
the
Protector
are
useful
in
lane
for
not
only
the
mana
regen
but
also
the
healing
sustain
and
increased
mana
pool.
The
only
downside
to
this
build
is
Archangel's
Staff
/
Tear
of
the
Goddess
as
well
as
Rod
of
Ages
take
considerable
time
to
stack.
Keep
in
mind
that
Rod
of
Ages
isn't
the
only
mana
item
that
synergizes
with
Archangel's
Staff
.
Lich
Bane
,
Iceborn
Gauntlet
,
and
Frozen
Heart
can
all
replace
or
be
added
to
Rod
of
Ages
depending
on
one's
champion
and
one's
team's
needs,
Lich
Bane
for
more
burst
and
Iceborn
Gauntlet
or
Frozen
Heart
for
each's
own
armor
and
utility.
By
building
a
full
set
of
items
giving
mana,
(fully
stacked
Archangel's
Staff
,
maxed
Rod
of
Ages
,
Iceborn
Gauntlet
,
Frozen
Heart
and
Lich
Bane
)
you
will
acquire
total
bonus
3150
mana,
which
will
grant
total
94.
5
bonus
ability
power,
not
counting
for
champion's
base
mana
rating
and
other
stats
given
by
those
items
indefinitely.
Archangel's
Staff
has
great
synergy
with
a
Rabadon's
Deathcap
,
as
it
increases
ability
power
by
30%.
This
means
that
whenever
your
mana
is
increased,
the
Archangel's
Staff
will
increase
your
ability
power,
and
then
the
Rabadon's
Deathcap
will
increase
it
again
due
to
the
30%
ability
power
passive.
To
gain
more
AP
from
the
Archangel's
Staff
than
a
single
Rabadon's
Deathcap
(which
gives
156
ability
power
if
alone)
a
champion
would
need
more
than
3200
mana.
However,
a
champion
would
only
need
2000
mana
for
the
Archangel's
Staff
to
provide
more
ability
power
than
a
second
Rabadon's
Deathcap
.
With
the
passive
of
this
item,
each
100
gold
spent
on
mana
at
base
efficiency
will
grant
additional
ability
power
worth
32.
625
gold.
Notes
Note
that
most
champions
have
around
800-1000
base
mana
at
level
18.
Not
counting
manaless
champions,
Vayne
and
Ashe
have
208
mana
at
level
one,
the
lowest
in
the
game,
which
combined
with
the
staff's
own
250
mana
already
equals
458.
Taking
into
account
the
time
(and
therefore
level)
it
takes
to
get
the
gold
to
buy
it,
it
is
practically
impossible
for
this
item
to
be
gold
inefficient.
Archangel's
Staff
grants
1
ability
power
per
~33
mana,
giving
a
total
of
67.
5
ability
power
at
zero
stacks.
It
gives
as
much
ability
power
per
gold
as
a
Needlessly
Large
Rod
at
2500
mana.
The
bonus
mana
does
not
stack
with
multiple
Archangel's
Staves
,
Tears
of
the
Goddess
or
Manamunes
.
Assuming
a
charge
is
gained
every
4
seconds,
the
750
mana
Unique
Passive
takes
6
minutes
and
16
seconds
to
max.
(The
Tears
of
the
Goddess
takes
12
minutes
and
32
seconds).
There
is
a
3
charge
banking
system
to
help
burst
casters.
Rammus's
Powerball
adds
one
stack
upon
cast
and
another
stack
if
ended
early
without
a
collision.
Similarly,
Janna's
Howling
Gale
adds
one
stack
upon
activation,
and
a
second
if
activated
early.
Singed's
Poison
Trail
adds
one
stack
whenever
the
ability's
toggle
is
active
and
the
Tear/Archangel's
Staff
stack
is
not
cooling
down
(ie,
continuously).
Manaless
champions
may
charge
the
Tear
of
the
Goddess
,
Manamune
and
Archangel's
Staff
to
get
Muramana
and
Seraph's
Embrace
.
However,
they
won't
get
any
bonuses
of
Muramana's
Awe
and
toggle,
as
well
as
Seraph's
Embrace
's
Insight
and
Mana
Shield
.

Skill
usage
Autoattacking
in
between
each
Broken
Wings
will
allow
the
most
amount
of
sustained
damage
as
you
consume
Runic
Blade
stacks
to
deal
extra
damage.
Since
the
skill
produces
three
charges,
which
is
exactly
her
maximum,
you
may
wish
to
complete
it
to
initiate
a
fight
with
her
knockup,
following
up
with
auto-attacks
and
her
other
skills.
It
is
a
good
idea
to
learn
how
to
auto-attack
cancel
with
Riven.
This
can
be
done
by
using
any
of
her
abilities
immediately
as
the
damage
is
applied
during
an
auto-attack.
Because
Riven's
auto-attack
animation
is
longer
than
the
time
it
takes
for
the
damage
to
actually
register,
doing
this
can
cut
off
more
than
a
second
from
a
Q&gt;AA&gt;Q&gt;AA&gt;Q&gt;AA
combo.
You
must
apply
a
new
attack
command
in
between
each
&quot;Q&quot;
to
obtain
the
maximum
possible
speed.
Blade
of
the
Exile
lasts
for
15
seconds
so
use
it
at
the
start
of
the
fight
instead
of
the
end
of
the
fight.
Using
Broken
Wings
in
conjunction
with
Valor
will
give
you
small
boosts
of
mobility
as
they
move
you
forwards
a
bit.
This
is
a
very
efficient
way
to
move
around
the
map,
as
your
moves
cost
nothing.
Broken
Wings
,
however,
allows
you
to
click
on
the
mini-map
and
use
it
to
continue
moving,
while
Valor
will
cancel
your
move
actions.
Beware
using
skills
right
before
a
skirmish,
as
your
abilities
will
be
on
cooldown
and
thus
be
unavailable
for
the
fight.
Broken
Wings
can
also
allow
you
to
chase
an
enemy
so
that
you
can
knock
them
up.
Remember
that
Broken
Wings
and
Valor
give
you
some
mobility
boosts
for
fleeing,
but
only
the
third
strike
of
Broken
Wings
can
pass
map
terrain.
You
can,
however,
dash
with
all
of
them
through
terrain
generated
by
abilities
like
Anivia's
Crystallize
,
Jarvan
IV's
Cataclysm
,
or
Trundle's
Pillar
of
Ice
.
Make
sure
you
test
what
map
terrain
is
jumpable
over.
An
example
being:
The
walls
separating
the
river
and
the
jungle
in
Summoner's
Rift.
Be
aware
that
Wind
Slash
has
a
cast
time
and
a
travel
time
as
well,
so
you
shouldn't
waste
it
on
enemies
who
are
just
about
to
leave
its
range.
Try
using
smart
cast
to
save
precious
seconds
in
aiming
the
ability.
Wind
Slash
deals
maximum
damage
to
multiple
opponents
at
or
below
25%
maximum
health
,
therefore
use
Wind
Slash
to
finish
off
enemies
who
are
fleeing
or
deciding
to
stay
despite
low
health.
Riven
is
an
all-around
strong
champion
in
top
solo
lane
due
to
her
ability
to
avoid
ganks
with
her
mobility,
her
no-mana
costs,
and
her
instant
cast
shield.
Play
aggressively
and
use
Valor
to
shield
your
way
through
harass.
Broken
Wings
resets
her
auto-attacks
on
each
cast
and
it
is
usefull
to
cut
off
the
animation.
(Tested
under
attack
speed
Slows)
Broken
Wings
'
dash
speed
is
roughly
equivalent
to
475
movement
speed.
At
550
movement
speed,
however,
simply
moving
is
faster
than
using
Broken
Wings
as
a
method
of
faster
travel.
Ki
Burst
can
be
used
to
cancel
the
animation
of
her
auto-attacks
and
the
crescent
activation
of
Ravenous
Hydra
.
However,
it's
own
animation
cannot
be
cancelled.
Riven
may
cancel
the
animation
of
Wind
Slash
with
Broken
Wings
'
third
cast.
Use
this
to
speed
up
your
combo.
Build
usage
Riven's
entire
kit
benefits
from
bonus
attack
damage
.
Building
heavy
attack
damage
items
will
not
only
help
maximize
her
damage,
but
also
increase
her
survivability
through
Valor
.
As
such,
you
will
probably
at
least
want
to
get
The
Bloodthirster
or
Ravenous
Hydra
,
which
deals
more
damage
overall
(active
included).
Riven
benefits
heavily
from
cooldown
reduction
which
will
allow
her
to
use
all
her
moves
more
frequently.
However,
at
later
levels,
Riven
is
likely
to
have
at
least
one
of
her
abilities
available
for
use
even
without
cooldown
reduction
due
to
prefering
to
take
her
time
to
autoattack
between
casts
and
the
cooldown
of
Broken
Wings
starting
even
if
you
delay
the
later
two
casts
of
it,
which
make
the
stat
less
needed
then.
With
this
being
said
items
such
as
The
Brutalizer
and
Ionian
Boots
of
Lucidity
are
good
items
for
her.
Having
a
way
to
slow
the
enemy
or
speed
yourself
up
is
mandatory
on
Riven.
However,
Riven
is
very
good
at
dealing
damage
while
chasing
as
Broken
Wings
moves
Riven
forward
both
doing
damage
and
giving
her
an
opportunity
to
get
in
basic
attacks
without
losing
too
much
distance.
The
dash
distance
is
unaffected
by
Riven's
movement
speed
,
so
building
movement
speed
items
are
not
as
important
on
Riven
as
on
most
other
melee
champions.
A
Frozen
Mallet
is
good
for
this,
since
you
will
be
using
auto
attacks
in
between
abilities
to
maximize
your
passive
(none
of
your
abilities
will
otherwise
proc
the
slow).
It
also
gives
you
health
which
is
a
must
since
Riven
is
squishy
when
stunned,
sealed,
blinded,
or
otherwise
prevented
from
auto
attacking
or
using
her
Valor
or
Broken
Wings
to
escape
and/or
shield.
Randuin's
Omen
works
very
well
on
Riven
as
while
she
may
have
four
ways
to
dash,
they
are
all
short-ranged
and
Broken
Wings
loses
damage
if
used
fairly
far-away
from
the
enemy,
and
she
is
still
a
melee
champion
that
can
be
damaged
by
ranged
champions
without
reprisal
until
she
gets
close
enough.
Valor
can
move
Riven
close
enough
to
a
target
to
slow
them
with
Randuin's
Omen
and
then
walk
close
enough
to
have
casting
Broken
Wings
move
her
into
melee-range
while
damaging
the
target.
Guardian
Angel
is
an
excellent
one-stop
defensive
item,
and
its
passive
as
well
both
armor
and
magic
resistance
can
tide
Riven
for
a
good
while
before
she
may
require
other
defensive
items.
Guardian
Angel
works
well
with
The
Bloodthirster
,
as
the
former
provides
a
main
source
of
durability
and
the
latter
gives
a
main
source
of
damage.
Maw
of
Malmortius
is
sensible
for
Riven
if
she
is
fearing
magic
damage
-
the
attack
damage
is
obviously
useful
on
her
while
the
shield
and
passive
works
well
with
Valor
and
the
life
steal
from
The
Bloodthirster
in
helping
you
survive
a
bit
longer
in
a
close-fight.
Riven
does
only
physical
damage,
so
a
Last
Whisper
is
a
good
item
to
counter
the
armor
that
should
be
built
against
you.
The
Black
Cleaver
is
also
a
great
item
on
Riven,
as
Riven
can
easily
stack
its
passive
with
her
combos,
not
to
mention
the
extra
200
health
and
the
10%
CDR
the
item
gives
are
very
useful.
Riven
is
a
fairly
squishy
champion.
Grabbing
Doran's
Shield
,
or
Cloth
Armor
/
Boots
of
Speed
and
a
few
Health
Potions
into
a
match
will
help
your
survivability
early
on.
Later
these
can
be
built
into
your
boots
of
choice,
or
Madred's
Razors
/
Wriggle's
Lantern
.
Riven's
damage
output
is
severely
hampered
by
crowd
control
since
it
will
disrupt
your
flurry.
Consider
taking
Mercury's
Treads
over
Ionian
Boots
of
Lucidity
and
getting
Mercurial
Scimitar
against
crowd
control
heavy
teams.
Youmuu's
Ghostblade
should
be
used
after
the
2nd
hit
of
Broken
Wings
or
during
the
last
frame
of
animation
of
the
3rd
strike
to
avoid
losing
precious
seconds.
Stacking
Doran's
Blade
early
game
helps
due
to
it's
sustainability
and
AD.
Riven
is
great
for
Twisted
Treeline.
Her
strong
early
game,
and
mobility
with
her
abilities
help
her
to
dominate
top
lane,
as
well
as
give
her
great
ganking
ability.
She
also
performs
very
well
in
the
jungle.
After
netting
a
couple
of
kills
early,
you
should
be
able
to
snowball
pretty
hard.

Countering
Riven
has
a
strong
early
game.
Be
careful
when
laning
against
her.
If
necessary,
call
your
jungler
to
gank.
Riven
excels
at
trading
with
her
shield,
crowd
control,
and
fairly
high
damage
output,
dishing
out
her
damage
and
getting
away
before
you
even
put
yours
out.
Building
armor
will
mitigate
most
of
Riven's
damage
since
she
deals
only
physical
damage.
Riven
relies
on
her
abilities
and
quick
combos
more
than
her
basic
attacks.
As
such,
anything
that
can
disrupt
her
combo
(such
as
a
silence
or
stun
)
can
drastically
reduce
her
damage
output.
Champions
with
multiple
interuptions,
such
as
Alistar
,
can
work
well
as
effective
counters
for
her
in
a
1v1
lane.
Wait
for
Riven
to
use
Wind
Slash
or
until
after
Blade
of
the
Exile
has
worn
off
before
striking
her.
Riven
has
no
innate
sustain
and
the
shield
is
her
only
source
of
damage
mitigation.
Do
not
underestimate
Riven's
defensive
stats,
even
if
she
is
building
straight
damage.
Valor
scales
off
her
bonus
attack
damage
and
has
a
considerably
low
cooldown
late
game.
Don't
forget
about
her
mobility
and
overextend
when
chasing
Riven
.
Her
Broken
Wings
allows
her
to
dash
up
to
3
times,
and
her
Valor
allows
her
to
dash
and
grants
her
a
shield.
This
can
create
a
very
long
gap
between
you
and
Riven
.
Save
your
high-damaging
channeled
spell
(e.g.
Nunu's
Absolute
Zero
).
Riven's
third
Broken
Wings
and
Ki
Burst
can
stop
channeled
spells.
When
you
are
low
on
health,
do
not
face
Riven
as
her
Wind
Slash
deals
more
damage
the
lower
your
health
is.
If
you're
still
squishy
and
you
know
she
has
aqcuired
her
ultimate,
do
not
linger
around
with
below
25%
health
even
to
turret
hug,
as
she
can,
and
will,
flank
around
to
kill
you
with
Wind
Slash
.

Skill
usage
Autoattacking
in
between
each
Broken
Wings
will
allow
the
most
amount
of
sustained
damage
as
you
consume
Runic
Blade
stacks
to
deal
extra
damage.
Since
the
skill
produces
three
charges,
which
is
exactly
her
maximum,
you
may
wish
to
complete
it
to
initiate
a
fight
with
her
knockup,
following
up
with
auto-attacks
and
her
other
skills.
It
is
a
good
idea
to
learn
how
to
auto-attack
cancel
with
Riven.
This
can
be
done
by
using
any
of
her
abilities
immediately
as
the
damage
is
applied
during
an
auto-attack.
Because
Riven's
auto-attack
animation
is
longer
than
the
time
it
takes
for
the
damage
to
actually
register,
doing
this
can
cut
off
more
than
a
second
from
a
Q&gt;AA&gt;Q&gt;AA&gt;Q&gt;AA
combo.
You
must
apply
a
new
attack
command
in
between
each
&quot;Q&quot;
to
obtain
the
maximum
possible
speed.
Blade
of
the
Exile
lasts
for
15
seconds
so
use
it
at
the
start
of
the
fight
instead
of
the
end
of
the
fight.
Using
Broken
Wings
in
conjunction
with
Valor
will
give
you
small
boosts
of
mobility
as
they
move
you
forwards
a
bit.
This
is
a
very
efficient
way
to
move
around
the
map,
as
your
moves
cost
nothing.
Broken
Wings
,
however,
allows
you
to
click
on
the
mini-map
and
use
it
to
continue
moving,
while
Valor
will
cancel
your
move
actions.
Beware
using
skills
right
before
a
skirmish,
as
your
abilities
will
be
on
cooldown
and
thus
be
unavailable
for
the
fight.
Broken
Wings
can
also
allow
you
to
chase
an
enemy
so
that
you
can
knock
them
up.
Remember
that
Broken
Wings
and
Valor
give
you
some
mobility
boosts
for
fleeing,
but
only
the
third
strike
of
Broken
Wings
can
pass
map
terrain.
You
can,
however,
dash
with
all
of
them
through
terrain
generated
by
abilities
like
Anivia's
Crystallize
,
Jarvan
IV's
Cataclysm
,
or
Trundle's
Pillar
of
Ice
.
Make
sure
you
test
what
map
terrain
is
jumpable
over.
An
example
being:
The
walls
separating
the
river
and
the
jungle
in
Summoner's
Rift.
Be
aware
that
Wind
Slash
has
a
cast
time
and
a
travel
time
as
well,
so
you
shouldn't
waste
it
on
enemies
who
are
just
about
to
leave
its
range.
Try
using
smart
cast
to
save
precious
seconds
in
aiming
the
ability.
Wind
Slash
deals
maximum
damage
to
multiple
opponents
at
or
below
25%
maximum
health
,
therefore
use
Wind
Slash
to
finish
off
enemies
who
are
fleeing
or
deciding
to
stay
despite
low
health.
Riven
is
an
all-around
strong
champion
in
top
solo
lane
due
to
her
ability
to
avoid
ganks
with
her
mobility,
her
no-mana
costs,
and
her
instant
cast
shield.
Play
aggressively
and
use
Valor
to
shield
your
way
through
harass.
Broken
Wings
resets
her
auto-attacks
on
each
cast
and
it
is
usefull
to
cut
off
the
animation.
(Tested
under
attack
speed
Slows)
Broken
Wings
'
dash
speed
is
roughly
equivalent
to
475
movement
speed.
At
550
movement
speed,
however,
simply
moving
is
faster
than
using
Broken
Wings
as
a
method
of
faster
travel.
Ki
Burst
can
be
used
to
cancel
the
animation
of
her
auto-attacks
and
the
crescent
activation
of
Ravenous
Hydra
.
However,
it's
own
animation
cannot
be
cancelled.
Riven
may
cancel
the
animation
of
Wind
Slash
with
Broken
Wings
'
third
cast.
Use
this
to
speed
up
your
combo.
Build
usage
Riven's
entire
kit
benefits
from
bonus
attack
damage
.
Building
heavy
attack
damage
items
will
not
only
help
maximize
her
damage,
but
also
increase
her
survivability
through
Valor
.
As
such,
you
will
probably
at
least
want
to
get
The
Bloodthirster
or
Ravenous
Hydra
,
which
deals
more
damage
overall
(active
included).
Riven
benefits
heavily
from
cooldown
reduction
which
will
allow
her
to
use
all
her
moves
more
frequently.
However,
at
later
levels,
Riven
is
likely
to
have
at
least
one
of
her
abilities
available
for
use
even
without
cooldown
reduction
due
to
prefering
to
take
her
time
to
autoattack
between
casts
and
the
cooldown
of
Broken
Wings
starting
even
if
you
delay
the
later
two
casts
of
it,
which
make
the
stat
less
needed
then.
With
this
being
said
items
such
as
The
Brutalizer
and
Ionian
Boots
of
Lucidity
are
good
items
for
her.
Having
a
way
to
slow
the
enemy
or
speed
yourself
up
is
mandatory
on
Riven.
However,
Riven
is
very
good
at
dealing
damage
while
chasing
as
Broken
Wings
moves
Riven
forward
both
doing
damage
and
giving
her
an
opportunity
to
get
in
basic
attacks
without
losing
too
much
distance.
The
dash
distance
is
unaffected
by
Riven's
movement
speed
,
so
building
movement
speed
items
are
not
as
important
on
Riven
as
on
most
other
melee
champions.
A
Frozen
Mallet
is
good
for
this,
since
you
will
be
using
auto
attacks
in
between
abilities
to
maximize
your
passive
(none
of
your
abilities
will
otherwise
proc
the
slow).
It
also
gives
you
health
which
is
a
must
since
Riven
is
squishy
when
stunned,
sealed,
blinded,
or
otherwise
prevented
from
auto
attacking
or
using
her
Valor
or
Broken
Wings
to
escape
and/or
shield.
Randuin's
Omen
works
very
well
on
Riven
as
while
she
may
have
four
ways
to
dash,
they
are
all
short-ranged
and
Broken
Wings
loses
damage
if
used
fairly
far-away
from
the
enemy,
and
she
is
still
a
melee
champion
that
can
be
damaged
by
ranged
champions
without
reprisal
until
she
gets
close
enough.
Valor
can
move
Riven
close
enough
to
a
target
to
slow
them
with
Randuin's
Omen
and
then
walk
close
enough
to
have
casting
Broken
Wings
move
her
into
melee-range
while
damaging
the
target.
Guardian
Angel
is
an
excellent
one-stop
defensive
item,
and
its
passive
as
well
both
armor
and
magic
resistance
can
tide
Riven
for
a
good
while
before
she
may
require
other
defensive
items.
Guardian
Angel
works
well
with
The
Bloodthirster
,
as
the
former
provides
a
main
source
of
durability
and
the
latter
gives
a
main
source
of
damage.
Maw
of
Malmortius
is
sensible
for
Riven
if
she
is
fearing
magic
damage
-
the
attack
damage
is
obviously
useful
on
her
while
the
shield
and
passive
works
well
with
Valor
and
the
life
steal
from
The
Bloodthirster
in
helping
you
survive
a
bit
longer
in
a
close-fight.
Riven
does
only
physical
damage,
so
a
Last
Whisper
is
a
good
item
to
counter
the
armor
that
should
be
built
against
you.
The
Black
Cleaver
is
also
a
great
item
on
Riven,
as
Riven
can
easily
stack
its
passive
with
her
combos,
not
to
mention
the
extra
200
health
and
the
10%
CDR
the
item
gives
are
very
useful.
Riven
is
a
fairly
squishy
champion.
Grabbing
Doran's
Shield
,
or
Cloth
Armor
/
Boots
of
Speed
and
a
few
Health
Potions
into
a
match
will
help
your
survivability
early
on.
Later
these
can
be
built
into
your
boots
of
choice,
or
Madred's
Razors
/
Wriggle's
Lantern
.
Riven's
damage
output
is
severely
hampered
by
crowd
control
since
it
will
disrupt
your
flurry.
Consider
taking
Mercury's
Treads
over
Ionian
Boots
of
Lucidity
and
getting
Mercurial
Scimitar
against
crowd
control
heavy
teams.
Youmuu's
Ghostblade
should
be
used
after
the
2nd
hit
of
Broken
Wings
or
during
the
last
frame
of
animation
of
the
3rd
strike
to
avoid
losing
precious
seconds.
Stacking
Doran's
Blade
early
game
helps
due
to
it's
sustainability
and
AD.
Riven
is
great
for
Twisted
Treeline.
Her
strong
early
game,
and
mobility
with
her
abilities
help
her
to
dominate
top
lane,
as
well
as
give
her
great
ganking
ability.
She
also
performs
very
well
in
the
jungle.
After
netting
a
couple
of
kills
early,
you
should
be
able
to
snowball
pretty
hard.

Countering
Riven
has
a
strong
early
game.
Be
careful
when
laning
against
her.
If
necessary,
call
your
jungler
to
gank.
Riven
excels
at
trading
with
her
shield,
crowd
control,
and
fairly
high
damage
output,
dishing
out
her
damage
and
getting
away
before
you
even
put
yours
out.
Building
armor
will
mitigate
most
of
Riven's
damage
since
she
deals
only
physical
damage.
Riven
relies
on
her
abilities
and
quick
combos
more
than
her
basic
attacks.
As
such,
anything
that
can
disrupt
her
combo
(such
as
a
silence
or
stun
)
can
drastically
reduce
her
damage
output.
Champions
with
multiple
interuptions,
such
as
Alistar
,
can
work
well
as
effective
counters
for
her
in
a
1v1
lane.
Wait
for
Riven
to
use
Wind
Slash
or
until
after
Blade
of
the
Exile
has
worn
off
before
striking
her.
Riven
has
no
innate
sustain
and
the
shield
is
her
only
source
of
damage
mitigation.
Do
not
underestimate
Riven's
defensive
stats,
even
if
she
is
building
straight
damage.
Valor
scales
off
her
bonus
attack
damage
and
has
a
considerably
low
cooldown
late
game.
Don't
forget
about
her
mobility
and
overextend
when
chasing
Riven
.
Her
Broken
Wings
allows
her
to
dash
up
to
3
times,
and
her
Valor
allows
her
to
dash
and
grants
her
a
shield.
This
can
create
a
very
long
gap
between
you
and
Riven
.
Save
your
high-damaging
channeled
spell
(e.g.
Nunu's
Absolute
Zero
).
Riven's
third
Broken
Wings
and
Ki
Burst
can
stop
channeled
spells.
When
you
are
low
on
health,
do
not
face
Riven
as
her
Wind
Slash
deals
more
damage
the
lower
your
health
is.
If
you're
still
squishy
and
you
know
she
has
aqcuired
her
ultimate,
do
not
linger
around
with
below
25%
health
even
to
turret
hug,
as
she
can,
and
will,
flank
around
to
kill
you
with
Wind
Slash
.

Autoattacking
in
between
each
Broken
Wings
will
allow
the
most
amount
of
sustained
damage
as
you
consume
Runic
Blade
stacks
to
deal
extra
damage.
Since
the
skill
produces
three
charges,
which
is
exactly
her
maximum,
you
may
wish
to
complete
it
to
initiate
a
fight
with
her
knockup,
following
up
with
auto-attacks
and
her
other
skills.
It
is
a
good
idea
to
learn
how
to
auto-attack
cancel
with
Riven.
This
can
be
done
by
using
any
of
her
abilities
immediately
as
the
damage
is
applied
during
an
auto-attack.
Because
Riven's
auto-attack
animation
is
longer
than
the
time
it
takes
for
the
damage
to
actually
register,
doing
this
can
cut
off
more
than
a
second
from
a
Q&gt;AA&gt;Q&gt;AA&gt;Q&gt;AA
combo.
You

in
between
each
&quot;Q&quot;
to
obtain
the
maximum
possible
speed.
Blade
of
the
Exile
lasts
for
15
seconds
so
use
it
at
the
start
of
the
fight
instead
of
the
end
of
the
fight.
Using
Broken
Wings
in
conjunction
with
Valor
will
give
you
small
boosts
of
mobility
as
they
move
you
forwards
a
bit.
This
is
a
very
efficient
way
to
move
around
the
map,
as
your
moves
cost
nothing.
Broken
Wings
,
however,
allows
you
to
click
on
the
mini-map
and
use
it
to
continue
moving,
while
Valor
will
cancel
your
move
actions.
Beware
using
skills
right
before
a
skirmish,
as
your
abilities
will
be
on
cooldown
and
thus
be
unavailable
for
the
fight.
Broken
Wings
can
also
allow
you
to
chase
an
enemy
so
that
you
can
knock
them
up.
Remember
that
Broken
Wings
and
Valor
give
you
some
mobility
boosts
for
fleeing,
but
only
the
third
strike
of
Broken
Wings
can
pass
map
terrain.
You
can,
however,
dash
with
all
of
them
through
terrain
generated
by
abilities
like
Anivia's
Crystallize
,
Jarvan
IV's
Cataclysm
,
or
Trundle's
Pillar
of
Ice
.
Make
sure
you
test
what
map
terrain
is
jumpable
over.
An
example
being:
The
walls
separating
the
river
and
the
jungle
in
Summoner's
Rift.
Be
aware
that
Wind
Slash
has
a
cast
time
and
a
travel
time
as
well,
so
you
shouldn't
waste
it
on
enemies
who
are
just
about
to
leave
its
range.
Try
using
smart
cast
to
save
precious
seconds
in
aiming
the
ability.
Wind
Slash
deals
maximum
damage
to
multiple
opponents
at
or
below
25%
maximum
health
,
therefore
use
Wind
Slash
to
finish
off
enemies
who
are
fleeing
or
deciding
to
stay
despite
low
health.
Riven
is
an
all-around
strong
champion
in
top
solo
lane
due
to
her
ability
to
avoid
ganks
with
her
mobility,
her
no-mana
costs,
and
her
instant
cast
shield.
Play
aggressively
and
use
Valor
to
shield
your
way
through
harass.
Broken
Wings
resets
her
auto-attacks
on
each
cast
and
it
is
usefull
to
cut
off
the
animation.
(Tested
under
attack
speed
Slows)
Broken
Wings
'
dash
speed
is
roughly
equivalent
to
475
movement
speed.
At
550
movement
speed,
however,
simply
moving
is
faster
than
using
Broken
Wings
as
a
method
of
faster
travel.
Ki
Burst
can
be
used
to
cancel
the
animation
of
her
auto-attacks
and
the
crescent
activation
of
Ravenous
Hydra
.
However,
it's
own
animation
cannot
be
cancelled.
Riven
may
cancel
the
animation
of
Wind
Slash
with
Broken
Wings
'
third
cast.
Use
this
to
speed
up
your
combo.
Build
usage
Riven's
entire
kit
benefits
from
bonus
attack
damage
.
Building
heavy
attack
damage
items
will
not
only
help
maximize
her
damage,
but
also
increase
her
survivability
through
Valor
.
As
such,
you
will
probably
at
least
want
to
get
The
Bloodthirster
or
Ravenous
Hydra
,
which
deals
more
damage
overall
(active
included).
Riven
benefits
heavily
from
cooldown
reduction
which
will
allow
her
to
use
all
her
moves
more
frequently.
However,
at
later
levels,
Riven
is
likely
to
have
at
least
one
of
her
abilities
available
for
use
even
without
cooldown
reduction
due
to
prefering
to
take
her
time
to
autoattack
between
casts
and
the
cooldown
of
Broken
Wings
starting
even
if
you
delay
the
later
two
casts
of
it,
which
make
the
stat
less
needed
then.
With
this
being
said
items
such
as
The
Brutalizer
and
Ionian
Boots
of
Lucidity
are
good
items
for
her.
Having
a
way
to
slow
the
enemy
or
speed
yourself
up
is
mandatory
on
Riven.
However,
Riven
is
very
good
at
dealing
damage
while
chasing
as
Broken
Wings
moves
Riven
forward
both
doing
damage
and
giving
her
an
opportunity
to
get
in
basic
attacks
without
losing
too
much
distance.
The
dash
distance
is
unaffected
by
Riven's
movement
speed
,
so
building
movement
speed
items
are
not
as
important
on
Riven
as
on
most
other
melee
champions.
A
Frozen
Mallet
is
good
for
this,
since
you
will
be
using
auto
attacks
in
between
abilities
to
maximize
your
passive
(none
of
your
abilities
will
otherwise
proc
the
slow).
It
also
gives
you
health
which
is
a
must
since
Riven
is
squishy
when
stunned,
sealed,
blinded,
or
otherwise
prevented
from
auto
attacking
or
using
her
Valor
or
Broken
Wings
to
escape
and/or
shield.
Randuin's
Omen
works
very
well
on
Riven
as
while
she
may
have
four
ways
to
dash,
they
are
all
short-ranged
and
Broken
Wings
loses
damage
if
used
fairly
far-away
from
the
enemy,
and
she
is
still
a
melee
champion
that
can
be
damaged
by
ranged
champions
without
reprisal
until
she
gets
close
enough.
Valor
can
move
Riven
close
enough
to
a
target
to
slow
them
with
Randuin's
Omen
and
then
walk
close
enough
to
have
casting
Broken
Wings
move
her
into
melee-range
while
damaging
the
target.
Guardian
Angel
is
an
excellent
one-stop
defensive
item,
and
its
passive
as
well
both
armor
and
magic
resistance
can
tide
Riven
for
a
good
while
before
she
may
require
other
defensive
items.
Guardian
Angel
works
well
with
The
Bloodthirster
,
as
the
former
provides
a
main
source
of
durability
and
the
latter
gives
a
main
source
of
damage.
Maw
of
Malmortius
is
sensible
for
Riven
if
she
is
fearing
magic
damage
-
the
attack
damage
is
obviously
useful
on
her
while
the
shield
and
passive
works
well
with
Valor
and
the
life
steal
from
The
Bloodthirster
in
helping
you
survive
a
bit
longer
in
a
close-fight.
Riven
does
only
physical
damage,
so
a
Last
Whisper
is
a
good
item
to
counter
the
armor
that
should
be
built
against
you.
The
Black
Cleaver
is
also
a
great
item
on
Riven,
as
Riven
can
easily
stack
its
passive
with
her
combos,
not
to
mention
the
extra
200
health
and
the
10%
CDR
the
item
gives
are
very
useful.
Riven
is
a
fairly
squishy
champion.
Grabbing
Doran's
Shield
,
or
Cloth
Armor
/
Boots
of
Speed
and
a
few
Health
Potions
into
a
match
will
help
your
survivability
early
on.
Later
these
can
be
built
into
your
boots
of
choice,
or
Madred's
Razors
/
Wriggle's
Lantern
.
Riven's
damage
output
is
severely
hampered
by
crowd
control
since
it
will
disrupt
your
flurry.
Consider
taking
Mercury's
Treads
over
Ionian
Boots
of
Lucidity
and
getting
Mercurial
Scimitar
against
crowd
control
heavy
teams.
Youmuu's
Ghostblade
should
be
used
after
the
2nd
hit
of
Broken
Wings
or
during
the
last
frame
of
animation
of
the
3rd
strike
to
avoid
losing
precious
seconds.
Stacking
Doran's
Blade
early
game
helps
due
to
it's
sustainability
and
AD.
Riven
is
great
for
Twisted
Treeline.
Her
strong
early
game,
and
mobility
with
her
abilities
help
her
to
dominate
top
lane,
as
well
as
give
her
great
ganking
ability.
She
also
performs
very
well
in
the
jungle.
After
netting
a
couple
of
kills
early,
you
should
be
able
to
snowball
pretty
hard.

Countering
Riven
has
a
strong
early
game.
Be
careful
when
laning
against
her.
If
necessary,
call
your
jungler
to
gank.
Riven
excels
at
trading
with
her
shield,
crowd
control,
and
fairly
high
damage
output,
dishing
out
her
damage
and
getting
away
before
you
even
put
yours
out.
Building
armor
will
mitigate
most
of
Riven's
damage
since
she
deals
only
physical
damage.
Riven
relies
on
her
abilities
and
quick
combos
more
than
her
basic
attacks.
As
such,
anything
that
can
disrupt
her
combo
(such
as
a
silence
or
stun
)
can
drastically
reduce
her
damage
output.
Champions
with
multiple
interuptions,
such
as
Alistar
,
can
work
well
as
effective
counters
for
her
in
a
1v1
lane.
Wait
for
Riven
to
use
Wind
Slash
or
until
after
Blade
of
the
Exile
has
worn
off
before
striking
her.
Riven
has
no
innate
sustain
and
the
shield
is
her
only
source
of
damage
mitigation.
Do
not
underestimate
Riven's
defensive
stats,
even
if
she
is
building
straight
damage.
Valor
scales
off
her
bonus
attack
damage
and
has
a
considerably
low
cooldown
late
game.
Don't
forget
about
her
mobility
and
overextend
when
chasing
Riven
.
Her
Broken
Wings
allows
her
to
dash
up
to
3
times,
and
her
Valor
allows
her
to
dash
and
grants
her
a
shield.
This
can
create
a
very
long
gap
between
you
and
Riven
.
Save
your
high-damaging
channeled
spell
(e.g.
Nunu's
Absolute
Zero
).
Riven's
third
Broken
Wings
and
Ki
Burst
can
stop
channeled
spells.
When
you
are
low
on
health,
do
not
face
Riven
as
her
Wind
Slash
deals
more
damage
the
lower
your
health
is.
If
you're
still
squishy
and
you
know
she
has
aqcuired
her
ultimate,
do
not
linger
around
with
below
25%
health
even
to
turret
hug,
as
she
can,
and
will,
flank
around
to
kill
you
with
Wind
Slash
.

must
be
worth
at
least
463g.

Force
Notes
The
lowest
base
movement
speed
in
the
game
is
325.
At
this
speed,
Lich
Bane
grants
16.25
movement
speed.
The
movement
speed
stat
only
increases
flat
movement
speed,
and
will
not
interact
with
other
percentage
increases.
Lich
Bane
's
passive
is
considered
an
on-hit
effect
and,
as
such,
is
capable
of
being
applied
to
skills
such
as
Ezreal's
Mystic
Shot
and
Gangplank's
Parrrley
,
which
effectively
adds
a
50%
AP
ratio
to
those
abilities
in
addition
to
their
natural
AD/AP
ratios.
Lich
Bane
scales
with
ability
power
while
Trinity
Force
scales
with
base
attack
damage
.
For
some
hybrid
champions,
it
may
be
better
to
buy
Lich
Bane
because
once
the
champion
reaches
level
18,
it
becomes
impossible
to
increase
the
damage
from
Trinity
Force
with
items
compared
to
Lich
Bane
.
The
proc
from
Lich
Bane
far
surpasses
Trinity
Force
with
a
Rabadon's
Deathcap
alone
on
the
majority
of
champions,
not
to
mention
other
AP
items.
The
highest
Trinity
Force
is
of
260,
achieved
by
Cho'Gath
and
Skarner
at
level
18.
Lich
Bane
beats
it
out
even
on
those
champions
at
281
ability
power.
Lich
Bane
does
not
proc
spell
vamp
nor
lifesteal.
Lich
Bane
is
especially
deadly
if
combined
with
an
AA
modifier,
such
as
Mordekaiser's
Mace
of
Spades
or
Twisted
Fate's
Pick
A
Card
massively
increasing
the
AP
ratio
on
the
ability,
and
is
even
more
effective
if
the
user
can
force
the
use
only
minding
the
2
second
cooldown.
Similar
to
Trinity
Force
,
Lich
Bane
synergizes
well
with
cooldown
reduction
,
enabling
champions
to
proc
the
bonus
damage
as
often
as
possible
while
minding
the
2
second
cooldown
;
the
10
second
bonus
damage
buff
does
not
stack.
Using
two
skills
in
quick
succession
will
not
accrue
two
stacks
of
bonus
damage,
but
one.
Lich
Bane's
proc
can
be
countered
by
Jax's
Counter
Strike
and
Fiora's
Riposte
.
The
effect
by
Lich
Bane
can
be
seen
on
the
champion
as
a
purple
glow.
For
example,
Kog'Maw
will
have
a
glowing
mouth,
Shaco
will
have
glowing
hands,
and
Master
Yi
will
have
a
glowing
sword,
etc.
The
glow
only
appears
after
using
an
ability.
The
same
thing
will
occur
with
Sheen
,
Iceborn
Gauntlet
and
Trinity
Force
.
You
can
easily
distinguish
between
Lich
Bane
buff
and
that
of
the
other
items
by
looking
at
the
color.
The
particle
from
Sheen
and
Trinity
Force
is
bright
red
and
it
leaves
a
small
trail.
The
particle
from
Iceborn
Gauntlet
is
bright
blue.
The
particle
from
Lich
Bane
is
bright
purple.

For

the

effect
must
be
worth
at
least
463g.

Force
Notes
The
lowest
base
movement
speed
in
the
game
is
325.
At
this
speed,
Lich
Bane
grants
16.25
movement
speed.
The
movement
speed
stat
only
increases
flat
movement
speed,
and
will
not
interact
with
other
percentage
increases.
Lich
Bane
's
passive
is
considered
an
on-hit
effect
and,
as
such,
is
capable
of
being
applied
to
skills
such
as
Ezreal's
Mystic
Shot
and
Gangplank's
Parrrley
,
which
effectively
adds
a
50%
AP
ratio
to
those
abilities
in
addition
to
their
natural
AD/AP
ratios.
Lich
Bane
scales
with
ability
power
while
Trinity
Force
scales
with
base
attack
damage
.
For
some
hybrid
champions,
it
may
be
better
to
buy
Lich
Bane
because
once
the
champion
reaches
level
18,
it
becomes
impossible
to
increase
the
damage
from
Trinity
Force
with
items
compared
to
Lich
Bane
.
The
proc
from
Lich
Bane
far
surpasses
Trinity
Force
with
a
Rabadon's
Deathcap
alone
on
the
majority
of
champions,
not
to
mention
other
AP
items.
The
highest
Trinity
Force
is
of
260,
achieved
by
Cho'Gath
and
Skarner
at
level
18.
Lich
Bane
beats
it
out
even
on
those
champions
at
281
ability
power.
Lich
Bane
does
not
proc
spell
vamp
nor
lifesteal.
Lich
Bane
is
especially
deadly
if
combined
with
an
AA
modifier,
such
as
Mordekaiser's
Mace
of
Spades
or
Twisted
Fate's
Pick
A
Card
massively
increasing
the
AP
ratio
on
the
ability,
and
is
even
more
effective
if
the
user
can
force
the
use
only
minding
the
2
second
cooldown.
Similar
to
Trinity
Force
,
Lich
Bane
synergizes
well
with
cooldown
reduction
,
enabling
champions
to
proc
the
bonus
damage
as
often
as
possible
while
minding
the
2
second
cooldown
;
the
10
second
bonus
damage
buff
does
not
stack.
Using
two
skills
in
quick
succession
will
not
accrue
two
stacks
of
bonus
damage,
but
one.
Lich
Bane's
proc
can
be
countered
by
Jax's
Counter
Strike
and
Fiora's
Riposte
.
The
effect
by
Lich
Bane
can
be
seen
on
the
champion
as
a
purple
glow.
For
example,
Kog'Maw
will
have
a
glowing
mouth,
Shaco
will
have
glowing
hands,
and
Master
Yi
will
have
a
glowing
sword,
etc.
The
glow
only
appears
after
using
an
ability.
The
same
thing
will
occur
with
Sheen
,
Iceborn
Gauntlet
and
Trinity
Force
.
You
can
easily
distinguish
between
Lich
Bane
buff
and
that
of
the
other
items
by
looking
at
the
color.
The
particle
from
Sheen
and
Trinity
Force
is
bright
red
and
it
leaves
a
small
trail.
The
particle
from
Iceborn
Gauntlet
is
bright
blue.
The
particle
from
Lich
Bane
is
bright
purple.
