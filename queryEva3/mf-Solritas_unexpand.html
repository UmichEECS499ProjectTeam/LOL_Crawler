PENDING
FOR
TEST
Impure
Shots'
relationship
with
dodge

,

stacks
of
Impure
Shots
accumulate
on
the
target,
and

not
reset
if

This
is
unlike
similar

such
as
Clockwork
Windup
and
Eternal
Thirst
,
which

on
the
champion
and
reset
whenever
they

    Sivir - She's actually really fun, but lacking! 
   
   Thanks! I think so as well, I wonder if the Reds know the community beta exists lol, I never seen them post here.

    Sivir - She's actually really fun, but lacking! 
   
   At this point I don't think i care about them buffing her range, Riot's been super stubborn about it, and it's useless to get them to do anything about that particular situation. 
 However they certainly can buff W the ways it needs to be. Right now corki is a better pick than Sivir because he has more single target AND AoE damage than sivir.

   Thanks! I'm eating Chips Ahoy Reeses cookies actually! 
 But seriously, I just don't think the stats Sivir gets is applicable enough to her W.

    Sivir - She's actually really fun, but lacking! 
   
   Thanks for replying! I was afraid these new beta forums were dead. 
 I don't know why they appear to be ignoring us :\ We're the ones stuck playing their champions, so they should be paying attention. 
 Having 500 range is absolutely brutal, especially if her strength's aren't strong enough, which they're not. I could settle for Sivir having 550-575 range with her current state unchanged sans the range, but as of right now 500 range is absolute trash on her. 
 Critical hit doesn't really matter, which is really bad for her.

it
is
displayed
on
a
user's
computer.
