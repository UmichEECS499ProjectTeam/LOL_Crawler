he
gains
a
charge
of
Sap
Magic.
When

an
on-hit
effect
.
The
triggering
attack
will
apply
on-hit
effects
and
can
critically
strike
as
normal.
Sap
Magic
is
not
consumed
and
does
not
heal
Maokai
when
the
triggering
Attack
is
dodged
by
Counter
Strike
or
misses
because
of
a
blind
effect.
Sap
Magic
is
not
affected
by
Riposte
or
Aegis
Protection
,
although
the
triggering
Attack
will
still
be
negated.
Sap
Magic's
on-hit
effect

is
at
full
health.

Magic
will
not
trigger
on
attacks
against
structures.

Ability
Details
Twisted
Advance
is
a
targeted
dash
.
Applies
spell
effects
as
a
single
target
ability.
Spell
vamp
is
fully
applied.
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
will
apply
a
35%
slow.
Magic
damage
will
be
mitigated
by
Black
Shield
and
Lifeline
.
Spell
shields
will
block
Twisted
Advance.
Additional
Information:
Twisted
Advance
will
cancel
mid-dash
if
the
target
dies
or
becomes
untargetable.
Maokai
will
continue
to
chase
his
target
even
if
he
loses
sight
of
them.
There
is
an
occasional
bug
where
losing
sight
of
his
target
causes
the
animation
to
freeze
mid-air.
Despite
how
it
looks,
Maokai
will
continue
to
chase
his
target
and
Maokai
will
&quot;blink&quot;
to
where
he
should
be
once
he
arrives
at
his
target.
Maokai
will
follow
any
dash
ability,
with
the
exception
of
Paranoia
,
Gate
,
Stand
United
and
Teleport
.
Becoming
untargetable
will
prevent
damage
from
non-targeted
spells,
such
as
Requiem
,
as
well
as
dropping
aggro
from
turrets
and
AI
units.
Maokai
will
safely
pass
through
Jinx
Flame
Chompers!
Possible
Bug:
Maokai
is
able
to
interact
with
Dark
Passage
as
he
passes
over
it.
His
target
will
become
rooted
when
Maokai
arrives
at
Thresh's
location,
allowing
him
to
&quot;safely&quot;
root
people
(i.e.
root
without
jumping
in).

Maokai
hurls
a
sapling
to
a
target
area,
dealing
magic
damage
on
impact
within

The
sapling
becomes
implanted
in
the
ground,
granting
350
range
vision
of
its
surroundings
for
up
to
35
seconds.
After
a
1
second
delay
after
landing,
the
sapling
will
seek
out
nearby
enemies.
When
an
enemy
comes
within
250
range,
the
sapling
will
chase
for
up
to
2.

Details
Sapling
Toss
is
a
ground-targeted
area
of
effect
that
summons
a
non-targetable
minion
.
Applies
spell
effects
as
an
area
of
effect
ability.
Spell
vamp
is
reduced
to
one-third
effectiveness.
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
will
apply
a

by
Black
Shield
and
Lifeline
.
Spell

Additional
Information:
Sapling
Toss
grants
vision
of
the
target
area
even
while
the
sapling
in
flight.
Unlike
Elise's
Volatile
Spiderling
or
Yorick's
Ghouls
,
Saplings
will
continue
to
chase
their
target
even
if
they
lose
sight.
However,
Saplings
do
not
prioritize
champions
and

Ability
Details
Twisted
Advance
is
a
targeted
dash
.
Applies
spell
effects
as
a
single
target
ability.
Spell
vamp
is
fully
applied.
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
will
apply
a
35%
slow.
Magic
damage
will
be
mitigated
by
Black
Shield
and
Lifeline
.
Spell
shields
will
block
Twisted
Advance.
Additional
Information:
Twisted
Advance
will
cancel
mid-dash
if
the
target
dies
or
becomes
untargetable.
Maokai
will
continue
to
chase
his
target
even
if
he
loses
sight
of
them.
There
is
an
occasional
bug
where
losing
sight
of
his
target
causes
the
animation
to
freeze
mid-air.
Despite
how
it
looks,
Maokai
will
continue
to
chase
his
target
and
Maokai
will
&quot;blink&quot;
to
where
he
should
be
once
he
arrives
at
his
target.
Maokai
will
follow
any
dash
ability,
with
the
exception
of
Paranoia
,
Gate
,
Stand
United
and
Teleport
.
Becoming
untargetable
will
prevent
damage
from
non-targeted
spells,
such
as
Requiem
,
as
well
as
dropping
aggro
from
turrets
and
AI
units.
Maokai
will
safely
pass
through
Jinx
Flame
Chompers!
Possible
Bug:
Maokai
is
able
to
interact
with
Dark
Passage
as
he
passes
over
it.
His
target
will
become
rooted
when
Maokai
arrives
at
Thresh's
location,
allowing
him
to
&quot;safely&quot;
root
people
(i.e.
root
without
jumping
in).

Maokai
hurls
a
sapling
to
a
target
area,
dealing
magic
damage
on

The
sapling
becomes
implanted
in
the
ground,
granting
350
range
vision
of
its
surroundings
for
up
to
35
seconds.
After
a
1
second
delay
after
landing,
the
sapling
will
seek
out
nearby
enemies.
When
an
enemy
comes
within
250

will
chase
for
up

Details
Sapling
Toss
is
a
ground-targeted
area
of
effect
that
summons
a
non-targetable
minion
.
Applies
spell
effects
as
an
area
of
effect
ability.
Spell
vamp
is
reduced
to
one-third
effectiveness.
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
will

Additional
Information:
Sapling
Toss
grants
vision
of
the
target
area
even
while
the
sapling
in
flight.
Unlike
Elise's
Volatile
Spiderling
or
Yorick's
Ghouls
,
Saplings
will
continue
to
chase
their
target
even
if
they
lose
sight.
However,
Saplings
do
not
prioritize
champions
and
will
not
change
focus
after
they
have
selected
a
target.
Saplings
are
untargetable
and
invulnerable,
but
will
appear
on
the

Ability
Details
Twisted
Advance
is
a
targeted
dash
.
Applies
spell
effects
as
a
single
target
ability.
Spell
vamp
is
fully
applied.
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
will
apply
a
35%
slow.
Magic
damage
will
be
mitigated
by
Black
Shield
and
Lifeline
.
Spell
shields
will
block
Twisted
Advance.
Additional
Information:
Twisted
Advance
will
cancel
mid-dash
if
the
target
dies
or
becomes
untargetable.
Maokai
will
continue
to
chase
his
target
even
if
he
loses
sight
of
them.
There
is
an
occasional
bug
where
losing
sight
of
his
target
causes
the
animation
to
freeze
mid-air.
Despite
how
it
looks,
Maokai
will
continue
to
chase
his
target
and
Maokai
will
&quot;blink&quot;
to
where
he
should
be
once
he
arrives
at
his
target.
Maokai
will
follow
any
dash
ability,
with
the
exception
of
Paranoia
,
Gate
,
Stand
United
and
Teleport
.
Becoming
untargetable
will
prevent
damage
from
non-targeted
spells,
such
as
Requiem
,
as
well
as
dropping
aggro
from
turrets
and
AI
units.
Maokai
will
safely
pass
through
Jinx
Flame
Chompers!
Possible
Bug:
Maokai
is
able
to
interact
with
Dark
Passage
as
he
passes
over
it.
His
target
will
become
rooted
when
Maokai
arrives
at
Thresh's
location,
allowing
him
to
&quot;safely&quot;
root
people
(i.e.
root
without
jumping
in).

its
surroundings
for
up

seconds.
After
a

the

minion
.
Applies
spell
effects
as
an
area
of

Additional
Information:
Sapling
Toss
grants
vision
of
the
target
area
even
while
the
sapling
in
flight.
Unlike
Elise's
Volatile
Spiderling
or
Yorick's
Ghouls
,
Saplings
will
continue
to
chase
their
target
even
if
they
lose
sight.
However,
Saplings
do
not
prioritize
champions
and
will
not
change
focus
after
they
have
selected
a
target.
Saplings
are
untargetable
and
invulnerable,
but
will
appear
on
the
map
as
a
minion.

Trivia
During
his
Art
Spotlight,
a
tab
for
Jarvan
IV
can
faintly
be
seen
at
the
top.
Later
during
the
Art
Spotlight,
a
tab
is
seen
titled
&quot;blindmonk&quot;,
which
refers
to
Lee
Sin
.
Maokai
was
designed
by
Volty
.
Maokai
is
an
anagram
for
&quot;I
Am
Oak&quot;.
Maokai
was
named
after
an
artist
at
Riot
whose
real
name
is
Maokai.
[1]
Maokai's
look,
sounds,
and
attitude
can
be
linked
to
the
Ents
in
The
Lord
of
the
Rings
saga.
Maokai
is
the
first
champion
to
be
&quot;born&quot;
on
the
Fields
of
Justice
.
Although
design-wise
there
is
no
clue
that
Maokai
is
an
Oriental
character
like
Xin
Zhao
.
His
name
follows
the
Mandarin
pinyin
scheme
like
Xin
Zhao
(while
Lee
Sin's
name
is
of
different
scheme).
The
official
Chinese
vendor
translates
his
name
as

which
literally
means
&quot;lush
(vegetation)-triumphant&quot;.
Maokai
was
originally
intended
to
be
just
a
Support/Tank
when
he
was
first
released
however
it
was
realized
that
Maokai
made
a
better
Jungler
with
strong
ganking
capabilities.
The
rune
spiral
that
is
on
Maokais'
ult
is
the
same
rune
that
is
attached
to
Xerath's
chest.
His
/dance
is
a
reference
to
the
Harlem
Globetrotters.
Maokai's
ability
Sapling
Toss
is
a
direct
refrence
to
the
game
Pikmin
from
the
toss
to
the
sapling's
sounds.
Maokai
shares
a
place
with
Poppy
in
having
the
highest
base
armor
of
any
champion
at
level
18
(90
armor).
Skins
Totemic
Maokai
is
based
on
a
totem
,
which
is
an
animal
or
other
natural
figure
that
spiritually
represents
a
group
of
related
people
such
as
a
clan.
Festive
Maokai
was
only
available
during
the
Snowdown
Showdown
of
2011.
Festive
Maokai
is
based
on
the
Christmas
tree
.
In
the
picture
frame
on
Festive
Maokai's
artwork,
the
Snowdown
Showdown
art
for
2011
can
be
seen
Haunted
Maokai
was
only
avaliable
during
the
Harrowing
of
2012.
Haunted
Maokai
resembles
part
of
a
reanimated
Graveyard
.
Haunted
Maokai
and
Zombie
Brand
are
the
first
skins
that
have
animation
on
respawn.
Relations
Maokai
is
a
tree
from
the
Twisted
Treeline
that
has
become
animated.
He
despises
the
existence
that
was
thrust
upon
him
as
he
felt
it
was
a
corruption
of
nature
and
so
fights
as
a
soldier
of
nature.
Maokai
despises
humans
and
their
chaotic
use
of
magic.
Although
Maokai
and
Malphite
have
different
attitudes
regarding
their
being
brought
to
life,
Malphite
stated
that
he
is
&quot;...proud
to
call
the
Twisted
Treant
my
ally&quot;,
suggesting
that
these
two
elemental
champions
get
along
quite
well
despite
their
differences.
According
to
League
of
Legends
Beta
site
Maokai
is
rival
with
Zyra
,
probably
because
of
difference
in
their
attitude
towards
humans
and
human
world.

Zyra
Maokai
was
once
a
peaceful
nature
spirit
dwelling
in
an
idyllic
forest,
but
the
arrogance
of
humans
brought
an
end
to
that
life.
Now
he
is
a
gnarled
shadow
of
his
former
self,
twisted
by
dark
magics
that
defied
the
natural
order
of
life
and
death.
Infused
with
power
he
never
asked
for,
the
mighty
treant
has
become
a
vengeful
force
of
nature,
sundering
his
enemies
with
wild
magic
and
iron-hard
limbs
as
he
searches
Valoran
for
the
means
to
restore
the
Shadow
Isles
to
its
former
glory.
Before
the
Shadow
Isles
became
a
land
of
death,
the
islands
teemed
with
natural
life
and
beauty.
This
was
never
truer
than
in
the
isles'
sacred
forest:
a
paradise
of
thriving
trees
and
countless
species,
both
animal
and
spirit
alike.
When
the
king
of
the
Shadow
Isles
ordered
his
sorcerers
to
crack
open
the
barrier
separating
life
and
death,
the
forest
served
as
a
well
of
power
the
magi
drank
deeply
from.
The
sorcerers'
ritual
succeeded
in
corrupting
the
cycle
of
life
and
unleashing
forces
they
could
not
hope
to
contain.
Vitality
seeped
from
every
living
thing
in
the
Shadow
Isles:
great
trees
withered
into
gnarled
husks,
people
warped
into
twisted
shades,
and
forest
spirits
became
hollow
wisps.
Maokai,
the
strongest
spirit
of
the
sacred
forest,
watched
in
horror
as
his
world
crumbled
and
died
around
him.
He
fought
to
mend
the
wound
in
the
world,
but
could
not
halt
the
destruction
wrought
by
the
human
folly.
As
the
ghastly
energies
sought
to
overwhelm
the
great
spirit,
he
made
one
last
desperate
attempt
to
preserve
the
life
of
the
land.
Maokai
inhabited
the
ancient
oak
at
the
heart
of
the
forest's
spiritual
power.
There
he
gathered
the
essence
of
the
isles
into
the
tree
as
the
corruption
of
undeath
clawed
hungrily
at
anything
within
reach.
Fortified
by
boundless
magic,
Maokai
could
not
be
consumed
entirely,
though
the
spirit
was
not
left
unscathed.
Maokai,
now
saturated
with
the
essences
of
life
and
death,
became
fused
with
the
ancient
oak
and
contorted
into
an
abomination.
For
ages,
pain
and
grief
were
the
only
companions
the
spirit
had.
His
boughs
grew
heavy
as
he
wept
at
the
desolation
of
everything
he
had
known
and
loved,
and
his
roots
tore
from
the
earth
as
he
raged
at
the
reckless
sorcerers
that
had
ruined
his
home.
But
all
was
not
lost.
Maokai
had
preserved
the
last
vital
spark
remaining
in
the
Shadow
Isles,
and
with
it,
the
hope
of
returning
life
to
the
land.
Like
moths
to
a
flame,
the
tormented
shades
of
the
Shadow
Isles
were
drawn
to
the
living
essence
within
Maokai.
The
spirit
guarded
the
seed
of
life
from
the
relentless
undead,
but
Maokai
knew
he
could
not
fend
them
off
forever.
He
needed
to
escape
the
land
of
death
his
home
had
become,
so
he
cast
himself
into
the
sea
and
trusted
in
nature
to
guide
him
towards
a
living
land.
There
he
hoped
to
find
the
means
to
cast
out
the
forces
of
undeath
and
restore
life
to
the
Shadow
Isles.
To
defy
the
natural
order
has
consequences.

Maokai
The
twisting
magical
energies
unleashed
by
mages
during
the
Rune
Wars
caused
an
incredible
amount
of
devastation
to
the
natural
world.
The
League
was
established
to
control
the
use
of
this
magic
by
confining
it
to
the
Fields
of
Justice
.
By
limiting
its
use
to
there,
they
thought
that
they
could
prevent
it
from
doing
further
harm
to
the
environment.
It
seemed
that
they
were
successful
until
Maokai
came
into
being.
During
a
League
match
on
the
Twisted
Treeline
,
Maokai,
an
ancient
oak
that
stood
above
the
upper
jungle,
spontaneously
roared
to
life.
Ripped
from
the
natural
balance
by
arcane
forces,
his
sentience
was
forged
in
chaos.
Before
the
Adjudicators
of
the
League
could
step
in
and
suppress
him,
he
slew
all
six
champions
participating
in
the
match.
The
scholars
of
the
Arcanum
Majoris
took
a
keen
interest
in
him,
as
they
were
eager
to
discover
the
secrets
of
his
animation.
Maokai
was
furious,
however.
He
abhorred
the
existence
that
was
thrust
upon
him;
he
felt
it
was
a
corruption
of
nature.
He
learned
to
communicate
with
people
in
hopes
of
finding
a
way
to
be
returned
to
his
former,
true
state.
Seizing
the
opportunity,
the
League
offered
a
trade.
They
would
research
a
way
to
revert
him
so
long
as
he
agreed
to
fight
in
the
League
of
Legends.
Maokai
was
indifferent
to
verdicts
rendered
by
the
League,
but
he
was
eager
to
punish
summoners
for
their
wanton
use
of
magic.
He
agreed
to
the
terms
under
one
condition:
once
they
learned
how
to
turn
him
back,
they
would
never
animate
another
tree
again.
He
wears
a
lantern
on
the
Fields
of
Justice
to
set
him
apart
from
the
other
trees,
and
as
a
warning
to
the
animals
that
would
do
him
harm.
I
will
use
this
power
until
I
am
free
of
it.

OBSERVATION
A
frenzy
erupts
on
the
Twisted
Treeline.
Saplings
scurry
in
every
direction,
detonating
in
multicolored
explosions
of
arcane
energy.
League
Champions
and
summoners
alike
rush
onto
the
field
to
contain
an
uprooted
tree
that
is
not
only
moving,
but
also
attacking
everything
in
sight.
The
tree
is
visibly
confused
over
his
violent
birth
into
awareness,
and
he
involuntarily
conjures
an
arcane
storm
of
magic.
The
storm
grows
as
it
absorbs
energy
from
the
magical
and
physical
attacks
being
directed
at
the
verdant
force,
until
suddenly
the
torrent
explodes
with
enough
power
to
kill
everyone
present.
A
bright
orange
light
falls
over
the
scene
as
Kayle
appears,
shielding
the
group
from
death.
As
the
dust
clears,
the
tree
is
contained
in
an
earthen
dome
by
League
representatives,
and
immediately
whisked
away
to
the
Institute
of
War
for
further
examination.
REFLECTION
The
room
Maokai
found
himself
in
was
cavernous,
with
a
reflecting
pool
stretching
across
the
entire
expanse
of
the
floor.
A
human
adorned
in
flowing
purple
robes
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room,
reflections
of
light
from
the
pool
dancing
across
her.
An
honor
to
make
your
acquaintance.
The
woman
bowed
deeply,
admiration
glowing
in
her
eyes
as
she
beheld
the
treant.
I
shall
be
administering
your
judgment
for
entry
into
the
League.
Maokai
exploded
into
a
rage.
&quot;Judgment?
You
humans
woke
me,
and
created
this
abomination
of
life,
and
now
you
stand
and
judge
me?&quot;
The
summoner
did
not
respond.
She
raised
her
arms
and
muttered
an
incantation
under
her
breath.
The
floor
swam
beneath
him,
and
suddenly
the
room
dissolved
away.
His
roots
tingled
with
familiarity
as
he
found
himself
standing
in
a
large
expanse
of
trees.
The
forest
around
him
stood
tall,
with
strong
trunks
and
leaves
of
every
color
-
this
was
his
home
as
it
had
existed
eons
ago.
He
ached
for
what
was
long
passed.
Suddenly,
the
surrounding
terrain
exploded.
The
ground
surrounding
Maokai
sunk
and
bubbled
in
grotesque
ways.
Vegetation
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
began
to
melt
with
a
sickening
hissing
sound.
Humans
were
running
panicked
through
the
forest
under
a
rain
of
bullets
and
chemicals.
A
boy
fell
to
the
ground,
struck
by
a
stray
bullet.
The
summoner
and
Maokai
were
invisible
to
the
chaos
erupting
around
them,
but
somehow
the
boy
looked
straight
at
them,
the
life
in
his
bright
eyes
quickly
fading.
The
ground
below
Maokai
changed
again,
accelerating
until
it
became
a
blur.
Maokai
stood,
trembling,
as
the
scenery
assaulted
all
his
new
found
senses.
The
acrid
odor
of
trees
melting
in
a
pool
of
acid.
A
beautiful
island
the
color
of
the
sky
splitting
asunder
into
three.
A
beautiful,
ancient
city
of
white
quartz
twisting
into
itself
in
impossible
ways,
defying
the
laws
of
time
and
space.
Maokai
closed
his
eyes,
weary.
The
League
must
have
assumed
they
were
showing
him
something
new,
but
it
was
nothing
he
hadnt
already
known.
He
had
stood
for
centuries,
absorbing
the
pain
and
sorrow
from
the
abuses
wrought
upon
the
land
and
the
life
in
its
soil.
The
summoner
spoke
quietly,
holding
the
scene
that
flashed
before
them
in
reverence.
We
do
not
ask
for
any
of
this,
yet
it
is
brought
upon
us
by
those
who
would
do
evil.
By
joining
the
League,
you
can
help
us
prevent
these
things
from
happening.
Maokais
disgust
had
not
subsided.
You
humans
are
the
ones
who
are
causing
this.
You
ask
me
to
feel
for
you
when
all
I
see
is
the
hatred
you
bring
onto
yourselves.
When
you
see
your
children
being
overrun
with
weapons,
I
see
the
fallen
trees
carved
into
your
instruments
of
destruction.
I
see
the
land
which
has
existed
before
you
and
which
will
continue
to
exist
after
you
suffer
for
your
petty
squabbles.
Knowing
all
this,
would
you
still
choose
to
go
back?&quot;
She
asked.
The
treant
hesitated,
surprising
himself.
Or
will
you
continue
to
stand,
impassively,
believing
that
you
can
affect
none
of
this?
Her
accusatory
tone
snapped
him
from
his
momentary
hesitation.
&quot;Your
wars
are
no
concern
of
mine.
You
deign
to
awaken
me
to
the
pain
you
humans
suffer,
but
before
you
gave
me
this
curse
I
already
knew
your
pain
and
suffering.
When
the
earth
absorbs
the
blood
of
your
children,
it
cries.
I
have
withstood
this
longer
than
you
can
even
imagine.
We
of
the
earth
do
not
feel,
and
thus
I
am
not
of
the
conviction
to
change
how
you
humans
live
or
die.&quot;
The
summoner's
eyes
darkened.
It
was
not
the
response
the
League
wanted,
but
it
was
the
only
one
they
were
going
to
get.
Then
what
will
you
do?
I
will
walk
this
path
until
you
can
turn
me
back,
as
promised.
He
paused,
and
one
could
swear
that
something
akin
to
a
smile
twisted
the
trees
mouth.
Until
then,
I
will
punish
you
magic
users
with
these
hands
you
were
kind
enough
to
bestow
upon
me.
Composing
herself,
the
summoner
expelled
the
illusion
with
a
sweep
of
her
hands.
&quot;Very
well.
That
is
your
answer.&quot;
She
turned
on
her
heel
and
walked
away
without
another
word.
Maokai
watched
her
go,
impassively.
He
noticed
the
young
boy's
blood
from
the
illusion
lingering
in
a
puddle
on
the
floor,
though
the
body
had
been
whisked
away.
The
treant
started
to
walk
past
it,
but
suddenly
stopped
and
turned.
With
slow,
deliberate
movements,
he
yanked
off
a
chunk
of
his
roots
and
laid
them
gingerly
in
the
pool
of
blood.
The
roots
began
to
absorb
the
blood,
slowly
at
first,
and
then
desperately,
as
if
the
blood
could
not
be
held
back.
The
roots
jumbled
together
into
a
mess
of
knots,
and
then
a
sapling
emerged.
It
looked
up
at
him
with
innocent
eyes.
Another
chance
at
life.
Something
inside
the
ancient
tree
moved,
though
what
it
was
he
had
no
idea.
He
knew
that
someday
he
would
return
to
stillness,
but
things
would
never
be
the
same.
Development
Maokai

Champion
Sneak
Peek
Sometimes,
when
you
look
at
the
League
of
Legends
champion
lineup,
its
easy
to
feel
like
youve
seen
it
all.
Youve
seen
light
mages,
thorn
mages,
mad
scientists,
illusionists,
ninjas,
and
warriors
with
gigantic
swords.
But
theres
something
that
this
next
champion
has
that
none
of
them
do:
roots.
Thats
right,
while
you
may
have
been
engaged
in
epic,
pitched
battles
with
trolls,
gargoyles,
ogres,
scarecrows,
minotaurs,
mummies,
and
mutant
armadillos,
I
bet
youve
never
had
to
fight
a
tree
before!
Introducing
Maokai,
the
Twisted
Treant;
a
groundbreaking
new
champion
in
the
League
of
Legends
whose
bark
may
or
may
not
be
worse
than
his
bite.
You
decide.

(
Original
Stats
)
Sap
Magic
(Innate)
Each
time
a
champion
near
Maokai
casts
a
spell,
he
gains
a
charge
of
Magical
Sap.
When
he
has
5
charges,
Maokai's
next
melee
attack
drains
energy
from
his
target,
healing
him
for
a
percentage
of
his
maximum
health.
Arcane
Smash
(Q)
Maokai
slams
the
ground,
the
force
of
which
knocks
nearby
enemies
back
and
sends
an
arcane
shockwave
forward,
damaging
and
slowing
his
enemies.
Twisted
Advance
(W)
Maokai
dissolves
into
a
cloud
of
arcane
energies.
He
regrows
near
a
target
enemy,
dealing
damage
and
rooting
it
in
place.
Sapling
Toss
(E)
Maokai
hurls
a
sapling,
dealing
damage
on
impact.
The
sapling
becomes
implanted
in
the
ground,
warding
a
nearby
area.
When
enemies
approach,
the
sapling
attacks,
exploding
in
an
arcane
blast
that
damages
enemies.
Vengeful
Maelstrom
(Ultimate)
Maokai
shields
his
allies
by
drawing
power
from
hostile
spells
and
attacks,
reducing
non-tower
damage
done
to
allied
champions
in
the
area.
Maokai
can
prolong
the
effect
as
long
as
he
has
mana
to
spend
on
it.
When
the
effect
ends,
Maokai
unleashes
the
absorbed
energy
to
deal
damage
to
enemies
within
the
vortex.

Trivia
During
his
Art
Spotlight,
a
tab
for
Jarvan
IV
can
faintly
be
seen
at
the
top.
Later
during
the
Art
Spotlight,
a
tab
is
seen
titled
&quot;blindmonk&quot;,
which
refers
to
Lee
Sin
.
Maokai
was
designed
by
Volty
.
Maokai
is
an
anagram
for
&quot;I
Am
Oak&quot;.
Maokai
was
named
after
an
artist
at
Riot
whose
real
name
is
Maokai.
[1]
Maokai's
look,
sounds,
and
attitude
can
be
linked
to
the
Ents
in
The
Lord
of
the
Rings
saga.
Maokai
is
the
first
champion
to
be
&quot;born&quot;
on
the
Fields
of
Justice
.
Although
design-wise
there
is
no
clue
that
Maokai
is
an
Oriental
character
like
Xin
Zhao
.
His
name
follows
the
Mandarin
pinyin
scheme
like
Xin
Zhao
(while
Lee
Sin's
name
is
of
different
scheme).
The
official
Chinese
vendor
translates
his
name
as

which
literally
means
&quot;lush
(vegetation)-triumphant&quot;.
Maokai
was
originally
intended
to
be
just
a
Support/Tank
when
he
was
first
released
however
it
was
realized
that
Maokai
made
a
better
Jungler
with
strong
ganking
capabilities.
The
rune
spiral
that
is
on
Maokais'
ult
is
the
same
rune
that
is
attached
to
Xerath's
chest.
His
/dance
is
a
reference
to
the
Harlem
Globetrotters.
Maokai's
ability
Sapling
Toss
is
a
direct
refrence
to
the
game
Pikmin
from
the
toss
to
the
sapling's
sounds.
Maokai
shares
a
place
with
Poppy
in
having
the
highest
base
armor
of
any
champion
at
level
18
(90
armor).
Skins
Totemic
Maokai
is
based
on
a
totem
,
which
is
an
animal
or
other
natural
figure
that
spiritually
represents
a
group
of
related
people
such
as
a
clan.
Festive
Maokai
was
only
available
during
the
Snowdown
Showdown
of
2011.
Festive
Maokai
is
based
on
the
Christmas
tree
.
In
the
picture
frame
on
Festive
Maokai's
artwork,
the
Snowdown
Showdown
art
for
2011
can
be
seen
Haunted
Maokai
was
only
avaliable
during
the
Harrowing
of
2012.
Haunted
Maokai
resembles
part
of
a
reanimated
Graveyard
.
Haunted
Maokai
and
Zombie
Brand
are
the
first
skins
that
have
animation
on
respawn.
Relations
Maokai
is
a
tree
from
the
Twisted
Treeline
that
has
become
animated.
He
despises
the
existence
that
was
thrust
upon
him
as
he
felt
it
was
a
corruption
of
nature
and
so
fights
as
a
soldier
of
nature.
Maokai
despises
humans
and
their
chaotic
use
of
magic.
Although
Maokai
and
Malphite
have
different
attitudes
regarding
their
being
brought
to
life,
Malphite
stated
that
he
is
&quot;...proud
to
call
the
Twisted
Treant
my
ally&quot;,
suggesting
that
these
two
elemental
champions
get
along
quite
well
despite
their
differences.
According
to
League
of
Legends
Beta
site
Maokai
is
rival
with
Zyra
,
probably
because
of
difference
in
their
attitude
towards
humans
and
human
world.

Skill
usage
Sap
Magic
gives
him
a
lot
of
staying
power
during
the
lane
phase,
especially
if
facing/laning
with
champions
that
spam
skills
like
Evelynn
,
Akali
,
Cassiopeia
,
or
Karthus
.
Using
your
abilities
at
the
start
of
a
game
to
charge
your
passive
grants
you
a
small
burst
of
health
after
taking
damage
in
a
level
one
skirmish.
Sap
Magic
will
not
trigger
when
attacking
structures.
If
fighting
under
a
tower,
be
sure
to
attack
nearby
minions
if
you
need
the
heal.
Sap
Magic
does
not
trigger
when
you
are
at
full
health
,
so
do
not
be
afraid
of
last
hitting
minions
at
full
health
while
this
ability
is
up.
When
used
close
enough
Arcane
Smash
causes
a
small
knock-up
in
addition
to
the
slow
it
provides,
use
this
to
interrupt
channeled
spells
such
as
Katarina's
Death
Lotus
or
Nunu's
Absolute
Zero
.
Flash
and
Twisted
Advance
can
make
a
surprise
grab
and
provide
an
opportunity
to
open
a
team
fight.
Maokai
is
a
great
initiator
and
has
good
tower
diving/chasing
capability
thanks
to
Twisted
Advance
.
His
Sapling
Toss
is
also
able
to
chase
retreating
enemies
past
their
towers
and
possibly
kill
them.
Maokai
can
farm
using
Sapling
Toss
,
as
mid-game
the
sapling
can
kill
3-5
minions
easily.
The
Sapling
deals
damage
twice:
once
upon
impact
and
another
after
a
short
delay.
It
can
also
be
used
to
damage
enemies
in
brush
safely.
Use
Sapling
Toss
to
harass
enemies
in
the
lane.
Try
to
overshoot
your
target
slightly,
just
enough
to
get
the
impact
damage
and
allowing
the
enemy
to
dodge
into
the
explosion.
Try
to
aim
your
saplings
so
there
are
no
enemy
minions
nearby
to
trigger
them,
as
they
may
choose
to
explode
on
them
rather
than
the
desired
champion.
You
can
also
use
it
to
zone
out
enemies
by
placing
them
behind
the
enemy
minions,
forcing
the
enemy
to
duck
away
from
experience
range
or
take
damage.
Champions
with
Boots
of
Speed
can
outrun
the
sapling
quite
easily,
making
this
form
of
lane-control
mainly
effective
at
the
very
start
of
a
game.
Saplings
won't
detonate
on
stealthed
enemies,
but
can
hit
them.
This
is
very
useful
if
the
enemy
tries
to
flee
through
both
minions
and
stealth.
By
using
Sapling
Toss
multiple
times
in
a
bush,
stacking
them
on
top
of
each
other,
you
can
catch
unsuspecting
enemies
off
guard
resulting
in
a
huge
burst
of
damage
if
they
walk
into
your
saplings.
Vengeful
Maelstrom
is
not
a
channeled
spell,
so
Maokai
is
free
to
use
other
skills
while
supporting
his
teammates.
Remember
to
deactivate
right
before
all
enemies
leave
the
AoE
,
or
else
they
will
suffer
no
damage.
Vengeful
Maelstrom
is
very
useful
when
the
battle
ground
is
stationary,
such
as
during
a
tower
push
or
defense.
Using
it
in
the
open
will
usually
cause
enemies
to
run
out
of
it,
wasting
its
potential
unless
you
want
them
to
go
away.
During
a
push,
however,
the
designated
fighting
grounds
remains
around
the
tower,
which
forces
the
enemy
team
to
fight
on
your
terms.
Small
skirmishes
in
the
jungle
or
even
the
occasional
team
fight
are
good
times
to
use
Vengeful
Maelstrom
,
as
escape
routes
are
few
and
the
fighting
ground
is
often
crowded
and
fast
paced.
The
damage
output
from
Vengeful
Maelstrom
is
very
powerful
with
some
ability
power
.
Using
it
in
team
fights
to
hit
as
many
enemies
as
possible
can
turn
the
tide
greatly
in
your
teams
favor.
Vengeful
Maelstrom
is
good
for
small
skirmishes
in
laning
as
well.
If
you
aren't
sure
you
can
kill
your
enemy
with
the
normal
E-W-Q
combo,
throw
down
Vengeful
Maelstrom
to
add
that
extra
bit
of
damage
you
may
need.
Use
Vengeful
Maelstrom
while
tanking
minion
waves
to
quickly
kill
minions
and
shut
down
the
enemy's
push.
Vengeful
Maelstrom
can
be
very
useful
for
a
kamikaze
operation.
A
fully
built
Maokai
can
easily
store
up
the
300
bonus
damage
when
1
v
4
thanks
to
Sap
Magic
.
In
addition
to
free
hits
while
they
try
to
kill
you,
the
resulting
nuke
from
Vengeful
Maelstrom
can
often
get
an
unexpected
kill.
Place
it
over
enemies
and
yourself
should
you
expect
the
enemy
to
focus
on
you,
reducing
your
damage
taken
while
possibly
let
it
cause
more
to
enemies.
Place
it
over
allies
if
you
expect
enemies
to
aggressively
attack
them
instead.
Enemies
running
from
Vengeful
Maelstrom
isn't
necessarily
a
problem,
as
long
as
you
are
damaging
them
while
they
flee
from
it.
With
Arcane
Smash
,
Twisted
Advance
and
even
other
allied
crowd-control
effects,
the
enemy
fleeing
Vengeful
Maelstrom
can
allow
your
team
to
do
a
lot
of
damage
upon
them
without
receiving
reprisal
before
they
escape
the
circle.
Vengeful
Maelstrom
is
a
great
counter
against
other
champs'
AoE
ults.
Activate
Vengeful
Maelstrom
during
a
channel
such
as
Absolute
Zero
or
Death
Lotus
to
absorb
some
damage
and
later
retaliate
with
some
of
your
own.
Maokai's
typical
initiation
is
using
Sapling
Toss
,
rooting
them
near
the
sapling
with
Twisted
Advance
to
ensure
the
sapling
explodes
on
them,
and
finishing
off
with
Arcane
Smash
.
Waiting
until
the
root
is
just
about
to
end
before
using
his
knock-up
on
Arcane
Smash
increases
disable
time
on
them
as
well.
If
a
team
battle
is
about
to
start,
use
Vengeful
Maelstrom
after
you
jump
in
with
your
Twisted
Advance
,
positioning
its
location
to
net
as
many
enemies
and
allies
as
possible.
Maokai
's
damage
output
early
game
is
very
high
being
able
to
bring
a
squishy
enemy
to
about
1/3
of
their
health
using
a
few
well
aimed
Sapling
Tosses
.
When
they
get
low
enough
use
the
above
combo,
you
can
easily
get
a
kill.
Maokai
can
have
a
support
role
similar
to
Galio
,
being
able
to
deal
decent
damage
and
still
protect
allies,
or
Malphite
,
being
able
to
disrupt
enemy
positions
and
set-up
kills
for
his
allies
while
still
remaining
relatively
tanky.
Maokai
has
great
jungle
potential
and
is
one
of
the
fastest
clearing
junglers
with
Sapling
Toss
,
Arcane
Smash
and
his
passive
Sap
Magic
.

Orders:
a)
Due

for

If
you

at

you
can
save

and
go
straight
for

in
order
to
perform

b)
You
can
also

gank.
Red

Gank

In
this
case,
take

Build
usage
Maokai
suffers
from
naturally
low
MR
and
benefits
greatly
from
cooldown
reduction
,
so
Spirit
Visage
is
a
perfect
defensive
item
as
it
provides
a
nice
amount
of
both
along
with
synergizing
well
with
Sap
Magic
.
Health
items
synergize
well
with
Sap
Magic
and
improve
his
sustainability.
Shurelya's
Reverie
and
its
active
effect
is
excellent
for
helping
Maokai
getting
into
range
of
good
targets
to
use
Twisted
Advance
on,
or
peeling
allies
as
a
tank
is
wont
to
do,
in
addition
to
having
generally
useful
stats.
The
Philosopher's
Stone
that
is
part
of
the
recipe
also
as
vital:
providing
health
regeneration,
mana
regeneration
and
gold
over
time
-
all
very
useful
for
a
jungler
that
will
be
constantly
getting
damaged
by
monsters,
using
mana
to
kill
them,
and
have
lower
farming
potential
compared
to
laners.
Frozen
Heart
is
an
excellent
item
for
Maokai
,
giving
him
armor
for
survivability,
cooldown
reduction
to
allow
him
to
do
more
damage
and
control
fights
better
with
his
abilities,
mana
to
allow
him
to
maintain
Vengeful
Maelstrom
longer,
and
an
excellent
passive
to
reduce
the
damage
of
enemy
autoattackers.
If
using
a
Guardian
Angel
,
it
is
possible
to
save
your
Sap
Magic
until
after
you
have
resurrected
as
the
stacks
stay
with
you
through
death.
Doing
this
could
save
your
life
if
a
champion
decides
to
wait
around
until
you've
revived.
Maokai
,
much
like
Nautilus
has
rather
high
ability
power
ratios

of
Ages
highly
effective
him,
however,
don't
pick
more
than
two
of
this
as
you
might
leave
your
tankyness
behind.
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
provides
great
synergy
with
Sapling
Toss
,
as
it
applies
the
slow
with
its
first
hit
and
then
again
after
it
chases
down
and
explodes
near
an
opponent.
The
health
will
also
benefit
his
tanking.
Ohmwrecker
can
be
used
to
enable
Maokai
to
tower
dive
more
aggressivly,
and
save
himself
significant
damage
in
situations
where
he
is
dragged
under
tower
by
someone
using
an
escape
during
Twisted
Advance
.
If
your
team
is
already
very
tanky
and
are
in
the
need
of
damage,
you
can
actually
build
ability
power
similar
to
an
actual
mage.
Keep
in
mind
however
that
you
still
have
to
get
very
close
to
an
opponent,
and
as
such
you
should
try
to
remain
hard
to
kill.
Using
a
Sheen
or
Iceborn
Gauntlet
can
offer
great
results
due
to
Maokai's
high
base
attack
damage
and
low
cooldown
on
Arcane
Smash
.
Iceborn
Gauntlet
can
be
aggressive
alternative
to
Frozen
Heart
as
it
provides
almost
the
same
stats.
Chalice
of
Harmony
is
very
useful
on
Maokai
as
it
provides
valuable
MR
and
greatly
increases
his
mana
regeneration
to
extend
the
duration
of
Vengeful
Maelstrom
.
It
can
be
later
upgraded
into
a
Athene's
Unholy
Grail
for
increaced
MR
and
valuable
ability
power,

Countering
Part
of
Maokai's
ability
to
tank
comes
from
him
being
able
to
consistently
heal
through
Sap
Magic
.
If
you
can
spare
it,
try
using
Executioner's
Calling
or
another
healing-reduction
ability
to
minimize
its
effect.
When
jungling
,
Maokai
can
reach
level
2
and
gank
earlier
than
most
junglers
due
to
Sapling
Toss
stacking
and
strong
ganking
at
low
levels
with
Twisted
Advance
.
Be
aware
of
this
and
play
accordingly.
Using
Flash
can
pull
a
Maokai
using
Twisted
Advance
into
a
bad
position,
such
as
into
your
turret.
Maokai's
Vengeful
Maelstrom
will
detonate
for
damage
even
if
it
ends
due
to
death
or
mana
loss;
don't
forget
this
when
finishing
him
off
at
low
health.
Avoid
fighting
in
his
Vengeful
Maelstrom
,
as
the
spell
effect
can
turn
the
tide
of
a
teamfight
in
Maokai's
favor.
When
facing
a
laning
Maokai
,
the
most
reliable
way
to
avoid
Sapling
Toss
is
to
stand
near
your
minions,
then
run
when
he
throws
the
sapling.
This
way,
the
minions
draw
aggro
instead
of
you,
allowing
you
to
reliably
get
out
of
the
explosion
radius.
Avoid
the
bushes
if
possible.
Not
only
is
bush-hugging
ineffective
against
Maokai's
Sapling
Toss
,
it
can
actually
make
landing
the
explosion
damage
easier.

       Maokai was once a peaceful nature spirit dwelling in an idyllic forest, but the arrogance of humans brought an end to that life. Now he is a gnarled shadow of his former self, twisted by dark magics that defied the natural order of life and death. Infused with power he never asked for, the mighty treant has become a vengeful force of nature, sundering his enemies with wild magic and iron-hard limbs as he searches Valoran for the means to restore the Shadow Isles to its former glory. Before the Shadow Isles became a land of death, the islands teemed with natural life and beauty. This was never truer than in the isles' sacred forest: a paradise of thriving trees and countless species, both animal and spirit alike. When the king of the Shadow Isles ordered his sorcerers to crack open the barrier separating life and death, the forest served as a well of power the magi drank deeply from. The sorcerers' ritual succeeded in corrupting the cycle of life and unleashing forces they could not hope to contain. Vitality seeped from every living thing in the Shadow Isles: great trees withered into gnarled husks, people warped into twisted shades, and forest spirits became hollow wisps. Maokai, the strongest spirit of the sacred forest, watched in horror as his world crumbled and died around him. He fought to mend the wound in the world, but could not halt the destruction wrought by human folly. As the ghastly energies sought to overwhelm the great spirit, he made one last desperate attempt to preserve the life of the land. Maokai inhabited the ancient oak at the heart of the forest's spiritual power. There he gathered the essence of the isles into the tree as the corruption of undeath clawed hungrily at anything within reach. Fortified by boundless magic, Maokai could not be consumed entirely, though the spirit was not left unscathed. Maokai, now saturated with the essences of life and death, became fused with the ancient oak and contorted into an abomination. For ages, pain and grief were the only companions the spirit had. His boughs grew heavy as he wept at the desolation of everything he had known and loved, and his roots tore from the earth as he raged at the reckless sorcerers that had ruined his home. But all was not lost. Maokai had preserved the last vital spark remaining in the Shadow Isles, and with it, the hope of returning life to the land. Like moths to a flame, the tormented shades of the Shadow Isles were drawn to the living essence within Maokai. The spirit guarded the seed of life from the relentless undead, but Maokai knew he could not fend them off forever. He needed to escape the land of death his home had become, so he cast himself into the sea and trusted in nature to guide him towards a living land. There he hoped to find the means to cast out the forces of undeath and restore life to the Shadow Isles. Maokai -- ''To defy the natural order has consequences.''

Ability
Details
Twisted
Advance
is
a
targeted
dash
.
Applies
spell
effects
as
a
single
target
ability.
Spell
vamp
is
fully
applied.
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
will
apply
a
35%
slow.
Magic
damage
will
be
mitigated
by
Black
Shield
and
Lifeline
.
Spell
shields
will
block
Twisted
Advance.
Additional
Information:
Twisted
Advance
will
cancel
mid-dash
if
the
target
dies
or
becomes
untargetable.
Maokai
will
continue
to
chase
his
target
even
if
he
loses
sight
of
them.
There
is
an
occasional
bug
where
losing
sight
of
his
target
causes
the
animation
to
freeze
mid-air.
Despite
how
it
looks,
Maokai
will
continue
to
chase
his
target
and
Maokai
will
&quot;blink&quot;
to
where
he
should
be
once
he
arrives
at
his
target.
Maokai
will
follow
any
dash
ability,
with
the
exception
of
Paranoia
,
Gate
,
Stand
United
and
Teleport
.
Becoming
untargetable
will
prevent
damage
from
non-targeted
spells,
such
as
Requiem
,
as
well
as
dropping
aggro
from
turrets
and
AI
units.
Maokai
will
safely
pass
through
Jinx
Flame
Chompers!
Possible
Bug:
Maokai
is
able
to
interact
with
Dark
Passage
as
he
passes
over
it.
His
target
will
become
rooted
when
Maokai
arrives
at
Thresh's
location,
allowing
him
to
&quot;safely&quot;
root
people
(i.e.
root
without
jumping
in).

the

Volatile
Spiderling
or
Yorick's
Ghouls
,
Saplings
will
continue
to
chase
their
target
even
if
they
lose
sight.
However,
Saplings
do
not
prioritize
champions
and
will
not
change
focus
after
they
have
selected
a

Saplings
are
untargetable
and
invulnerable,
but
will
appear
on
the
map
as
a
minion.

Zyra
Maokai
was
once
a
peaceful
nature
spirit
dwelling
in
an
idyllic
forest,
but
the
arrogance
of
humans
brought
an
end
to
that
life.
Now
he
is
a
gnarled
shadow
of
his
former
self,
twisted
by
dark
magics
that
defied
the
natural
order
of
life
and
death.
Infused
with
power
he
never
asked
for,
the
mighty
treant
has
become
a
vengeful
force
of
nature,
sundering
his
enemies
with
wild
magic
and
iron-hard
limbs
as
he
searches
Valoran
for
the
means
to
restore
the
Shadow
Isles
to
its
former
glory.
Before
the
Shadow
Isles
became
a
land
of
death,
the
islands
teemed
with
natural
life
and
beauty.
This
was
never
truer
than
in
the
isles'
sacred
forest:
a
paradise
of
thriving
trees
and
countless
species,
both
animal
and
spirit
alike.
When
the
king
of
the
Shadow
Isles
ordered
his
sorcerers
to
crack
open
the
barrier
separating
life
and
death,
the
forest
served
as
a
well
of
power
the
magi
drank
deeply
from.
The
sorcerers'
ritual
succeeded
in
corrupting
the
cycle
of
life
and
unleashing
forces
they
could
not
hope
to
contain.
Vitality
seeped
from
every
living
thing
in
the
Shadow
Isles:
great
trees
withered
into
gnarled
husks,
people
warped
into
twisted
shades,
and
forest
spirits
became
hollow
wisps.
Maokai,
the
strongest
spirit
of
the
sacred
forest,
watched
in
horror
as
his
world
crumbled
and
died
around
him.
He
fought
to
mend
the
wound
in
the
world,
but
could
not
halt
the
destruction
wrought
by
the
human
folly.
As
the
ghastly
energies
sought
to
overwhelm
the
great
spirit,
he
made
one
last
desperate
attempt
to
preserve
the
life
of
the
land.
Maokai
inhabited
the
ancient
oak
at
the
heart
of
the
forest's
spiritual
power.
There
he
gathered
the
essence
of
the
isles
into
the
tree
as
the
corruption
of
undeath
clawed
hungrily
at
anything
within
reach.
Fortified
by
boundless
magic,
Maokai
could
not
be
consumed
entirely,
though
the
spirit
was
not
left
unscathed.
Maokai,
now
saturated
with
the
essences
of
life
and
death,
became
fused
with
the
ancient
oak
and
contorted
into
an
abomination.
For
ages,
pain
and
grief
were
the
only
companions
the
spirit
had.
His
boughs
grew
heavy
as
he
wept
at
the
desolation
of
everything
he
had
known
and
loved,
and
his
roots
tore
from
the
earth
as
he
raged
at
the
reckless
sorcerers
that
had
ruined
his
home.
But
all
was
not
lost.
Maokai
had
preserved
the
last
vital
spark
remaining
in
the
Shadow
Isles,
and
with
it,
the
hope
of
returning
life
to
the
land.
Like
moths
to
a
flame,
the
tormented
shades
of
the
Shadow
Isles
were
drawn
to
the
living
essence
within
Maokai.
The
spirit
guarded
the
seed
of
life
from
the
relentless
undead,
but
Maokai
knew
he
could
not
fend
them
off
forever.
He
needed
to
escape
the
land
of
death
his
home
had
become,
so
he
cast
himself
into
the
sea
and
trusted
in
nature
to
guide
him
towards
a
living
land.
There
he
hoped
to
find
the
means
to
cast
out
the
forces
of
undeath
and
restore
life
to
the
Shadow
Isles.
To
defy
the
natural
order
has
consequences.

Maokai
The
twisting
magical
energies
unleashed
by
mages
during
the
Rune
Wars
caused
an
incredible
amount
of
devastation
to
the
natural
world.
The
League
was
established
to
control
the
use
of
this
magic
by
confining
it
to
the
Fields
of
Justice
.
By
limiting
its
use
to
there,
they
thought
that
they
could
prevent
it
from
doing
further
harm
to
the
environment.
It
seemed
that
they
were
successful
until
Maokai
came
into
being.
During
a
League
match
on
the
Twisted
Treeline
,
Maokai,
an
ancient
oak
that
stood
above
the
upper
jungle,
spontaneously
roared
to
life.
Ripped
from
the
natural
balance
by
arcane
forces,
his
sentience
was
forged
in
chaos.
Before
the
Adjudicators
of
the
League
could
step
in
and
suppress
him,
he
slew
all
six
champions
participating
in
the
match.
The
scholars
of
the
Arcanum
Majoris
took
a
keen
interest
in
him,
as
they
were
eager
to
discover
the
secrets
of
his
animation.
Maokai
was
furious,
however.
He
abhorred
the
existence
that
was
thrust
upon
him;
he
felt
it
was
a
corruption
of
nature.
He
learned
to
communicate
with
people
in
hopes
of
finding
a
way
to
be
returned
to
his
former,
true
state.
Seizing
the
opportunity,
the
League
offered
a
trade.
They
would
research
a
way
to
revert
him
so
long
as
he
agreed
to
fight
in
the
League
of
Legends.
Maokai
was
indifferent
to
verdicts
rendered
by
the
League,
but
he
was
eager
to
punish
summoners
for
their
wanton
use
of
magic.
He
agreed
to
the
terms
under
one
condition:
once
they
learned
how
to
turn
him
back,
they
would
never
animate
another
tree
again.
He
wears
a
lantern
on
the
Fields
of
Justice
to
set
him
apart
from
the
other
trees,
and
as
a
warning
to
the
animals
that
would
do
him
harm.
I
will
use
this
power
until
I
am
free
of
it.

OBSERVATION
A
frenzy
erupts
on
the
Twisted
Treeline.
Saplings
scurry
in
every
direction,
detonating
in
multicolored
explosions
of
arcane
energy.
League
Champions
and
summoners
alike
rush
onto
the
field
to
contain
an
uprooted
tree
that
is
not
only
moving,
but
also
attacking
everything
in
sight.
The
tree
is
visibly
confused
over
his
violent
birth
into
awareness,
and
he
involuntarily
conjures
an
arcane
storm
of
magic.
The
storm
grows
as
it
absorbs
energy
from
the
magical
and
physical
attacks
being
directed
at
the
verdant
force,
until
suddenly
the
torrent
explodes
with
enough
power
to
kill
everyone
present.
A
bright
orange
light
falls
over
the
scene
as
Kayle
appears,
shielding
the
group
from
death.
As
the
dust
clears,
the
tree
is
contained
in
an
earthen
dome
by
League
representatives,
and
immediately
whisked
away
to
the
Institute
of
War
for
further
examination.
REFLECTION
The
room
Maokai
found
himself
in
was
cavernous,
with
a
reflecting
pool
stretching
across
the
entire
expanse
of
the
floor.
A
human
adorned
in
flowing
purple
robes
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room,
reflections
of
light
from
the
pool
dancing
across
her.
An
honor
to
make
your
acquaintance.
The
woman
bowed
deeply,
admiration
glowing
in
her
eyes
as
she
beheld
the
treant.
I
shall
be
administering
your
judgment
for
entry
into
the
League.
Maokai
exploded
into
a
rage.
&quot;Judgment?
You
humans
woke
me,
and
created
this
abomination
of
life,
and
now
you
stand
and
judge
me?&quot;
The
summoner
did
not
respond.
She
raised
her
arms
and
muttered
an
incantation
under
her
breath.
The
floor
swam
beneath
him,
and
suddenly
the
room
dissolved
away.
His
roots
tingled
with
familiarity
as
he
found
himself
standing
in
a
large
expanse
of
trees.
The
forest
around
him
stood
tall,
with
strong
trunks
and
leaves
of
every
color
-
this
was
his
home
as
it
had
existed
eons
ago.
He
ached
for
what
was
long
passed.
Suddenly,
the
surrounding
terrain
exploded.
The
ground
surrounding
Maokai
sunk
and
bubbled
in
grotesque
ways.
Vegetation
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
began
to
melt
with
a
sickening
hissing
sound.
Humans
were
running
panicked
through
the
forest
under
a
rain
of
bullets
and
chemicals.
A
boy
fell
to
the
ground,
struck
by
a
stray
bullet.
The
summoner
and
Maokai
were
invisible
to
the
chaos
erupting
around
them,
but
somehow
the
boy
looked
straight
at
them,
the
life
in
his
bright
eyes
quickly
fading.
The
ground
below
Maokai
changed
again,
accelerating
until
it
became
a
blur.
Maokai
stood,
trembling,
as
the
scenery
assaulted
all
his
new
found
senses.
The
acrid
odor
of
trees
melting
in
a
pool
of
acid.
A
beautiful
island
the
color
of
the
sky
splitting
asunder
into
three.
A
beautiful,
ancient
city
of
white
quartz
twisting
into
itself
in
impossible
ways,
defying
the
laws
of
time
and
space.
Maokai
closed
his
eyes,
weary.
The
League
must
have
assumed
they
were
showing
him
something
new,
but
it
was
nothing
he
hadnt
already
known.
He
had
stood
for
centuries,
absorbing
the
pain
and
sorrow
from
the
abuses
wrought
upon
the
land
and
the
life
in
its
soil.
The
summoner
spoke
quietly,
holding
the
scene
that
flashed
before
them
in
reverence.
We
do
not
ask
for
any
of
this,
yet
it
is
brought
upon
us
by
those
who
would
do
evil.
By
joining
the
League,
you
can
help
us
prevent
these
things
from
happening.
Maokais
disgust
had
not
subsided.
You
humans
are
the
ones
who
are
causing
this.
You
ask
me
to
feel
for
you
when
all
I
see
is
the
hatred
you
bring
onto
yourselves.
When
you
see
your
children
being
overrun
with
weapons,
I
see
the
fallen
trees
carved
into
your
instruments
of
destruction.
I
see
the
land
which
has
existed
before
you
and
which
will
continue
to
exist
after
you
suffer
for
your
petty
squabbles.
Knowing
all
this,
would
you
still
choose
to
go
back?&quot;
She
asked.
The
treant
hesitated,
surprising
himself.
Or
will
you
continue
to
stand,
impassively,
believing
that
you
can
affect
none
of
this?
Her
accusatory
tone
snapped
him
from
his
momentary
hesitation.
&quot;Your
wars
are
no
concern
of
mine.
You
deign
to
awaken
me
to
the
pain
you
humans
suffer,
but
before
you
gave
me
this
curse
I
already
knew
your
pain
and
suffering.
When
the
earth
absorbs
the
blood
of
your
children,
it
cries.
I
have
withstood
this
longer
than
you
can
even
imagine.
We
of
the
earth
do
not
feel,
and
thus
I
am
not
of
the
conviction
to
change
how
you
humans
live
or
die.&quot;
The
summoner's
eyes
darkened.
It
was
not
the
response
the
League
wanted,
but
it
was
the
only
one
they
were
going
to
get.
Then
what
will
you
do?
I
will
walk
this
path
until
you
can
turn
me
back,
as
promised.
He
paused,
and
one
could
swear
that
something
akin
to
a
smile
twisted
the
trees
mouth.
Until
then,
I
will
punish
you
magic
users
with
these
hands
you
were
kind
enough
to
bestow
upon
me.
Composing
herself,
the
summoner
expelled
the
illusion
with
a
sweep
of
her
hands.
&quot;Very
well.
That
is
your
answer.&quot;
She
turned
on
her
heel
and
walked
away
without
another
word.
Maokai
watched
her
go,
impassively.
He
noticed
the
young
boy's
blood
from
the
illusion
lingering
in
a
puddle
on
the
floor,
though
the
body
had
been
whisked
away.
The
treant
started
to
walk
past
it,
but
suddenly
stopped
and
turned.
With
slow,
deliberate
movements,
he
yanked
off
a
chunk
of
his
roots
and
laid
them
gingerly
in
the
pool
of
blood.
The
roots
began
to
absorb
the
blood,
slowly
at
first,
and
then
desperately,
as
if
the
blood
could
not
be
held
back.
The
roots
jumbled
together
into
a
mess
of
knots,
and
then
a
sapling
emerged.
It
looked
up
at
him
with
innocent
eyes.
Another
chance
at
life.
Something
inside
the
ancient
tree
moved,
though
what
it
was
he
had
no
idea.
He
knew
that
someday
he
would
return
to
stillness,
but
things
would
never
be
the
same.

Champion
Sneak
Peek
Sometimes,
when
you
look
at
the
League
of
Legends
champion
lineup,
its
easy
to
feel
like
youve
seen
it
all.
Youve
seen
light
mages,
thorn
mages,
mad
scientists,
illusionists,
ninjas,
and
warriors
with
gigantic
swords.
But
theres
something
that
this
next
champion
has
that
none
of
them
do:
roots.
Thats
right,
while
you
may
have
been
engaged
in
epic,
pitched
battles
with
trolls,
gargoyles,
ogres,
scarecrows,
minotaurs,
mummies,
and
mutant
armadillos,
I
bet
youve
never
had
to
fight
a
tree
before!
Introducing
Maokai,
the
Twisted
Treant;
a
groundbreaking
new
champion
in
the
League
of
Legends
whose
bark
may
or
may
not
be
worse
than
his
bite.
You
decide.

(
Original
Stats
)
Sap
Magic
(Innate)
Each
time
a
champion
near
Maokai
casts
a
spell,
he
gains
a
charge
of
Magical
Sap.
When
he
has
5
charges,
Maokai's
next
melee
attack
drains
energy
from
his
target,
healing
him
for
a
percentage
of
his
maximum
health.
Arcane
Smash
(Q)
Maokai
slams
the
ground,
the
force
of
which
knocks
nearby
enemies
back
and
sends
an
arcane
shockwave
forward,
damaging
and
slowing
his
enemies.
Twisted
Advance
(W)
Maokai
dissolves
into
a
cloud
of
arcane
energies.
He
regrows
near
a
target
enemy,
dealing
damage
and
rooting
it
in
place.
Sapling
Toss
(E)
Maokai
hurls
a
sapling,
dealing
damage
on
impact.
The
sapling
becomes
implanted
in
the
ground,
warding
a
nearby
area.
When
enemies
approach,
the
sapling
attacks,
exploding
in
an
arcane
blast
that
damages
enemies.
Vengeful
Maelstrom
(Ultimate)
Maokai
shields
his
allies
by
drawing
power
from
hostile
spells
and
attacks,
reducing
non-tower
damage
done
to
allied
champions
in
the
area.
Maokai
can
prolong
the
effect
as
long
as
he
has
mana
to
spend
on
it.
When
the
effect
ends,
Maokai
unleashes
the
absorbed
energy
to
deal
damage
to
enemies
within
the
vortex.
