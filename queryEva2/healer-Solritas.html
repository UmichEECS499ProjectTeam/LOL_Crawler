Healing
refers
to
the
ability
to
restore
health
to
a
unit.
Healing
(heals)
are
distinct
from
other
forms
of
health
restoration
(
life
steal
,
spell
vamp
and
health
regeneration
).
Healing
cannot
restore
a
unit's
health
over
its
maximum,
as
with
all
other
health
restoration.
Healing
also
does
not
refer
to
maximum
health
gained
from
abilities.

There
is
a
form
of
magic
unknown
to
many
Runeterrans
and
discredited
by
the
few
who
are
even
aware
of
its
existence.
It
is
the
magic
of
the
earth,
drawing
power
from
the
resonance
of
crystals
and
gems.
Taric,
the
Gem
Knight,
is
Runeterra's
sole
practitioner
of
this
form
of
magic,
having
been
erratically
summoned
to
Runeterra
from
a
faraway
world.
Back
home,
Taric's
father
was
a
distinguished
healer
in
their
home
city.
Taric
was
always
interested
in
his
father's
pursuits,
even
from
a
young
age.
Despite
his
burgeoning
understanding
of
herbs,
plants,
and
animal
medicines,
it
was
the
power
of
gems
that
most
fascinated
the
growing
boy.
It
wasn't
long
before
Taric
had
exhausted
his
father's
coveted
library
and
set
out
on
a
path
of
his
own.
He
wanted
to
help
the
people,
but
not
simply
salving
their
wounds
and
curing
their
woes.
He
wasn't
to
be
a
healer,
but
a
defender
-
one
who
used
the
power
of
earth
to
preserve
and
protect.
Taric
became
a
wandering
knight,
renowned
across
his
homeland
as
a
guardian
of
the
just
until
the
day
a
spell
of
summoning
grabbed
him
from
his
home
and
deposited
him
on
Runeterra.
Though
disoriented
and
confused
at
first,
he
now
feels
that
the
continent
of
Valoran
is
in
need
of
someone
like
him.
Despite
missing
his
homeland,
Taric
is
happy
to
fight
in
the
League
,
serving
as
a
protector
for
all
who
seek
one.
His
neat
and
stylish
appearance
combined
with
his
shiny
bejeweled
armor
and
weapons
have
rapidly
made
him
a
celebrity
champion
of
the
League
of
Legends.
Valoran's
media,
for
some
reason,
has
taken
great
interest
in
his
personal
life.
While
open
about
his
life
as
a
champion
and
gracious
in
all
things,
Taric
is
tight-lipped
about
his
life
outside
the
League
and
prefers
his
privacy.
&quot;As
Taric's
father
taught
him,
every
stone
has
its
meaning.
For
Taric's
enemies,
they
all
mean
trouble.&quot;

the

Quickly,
Taric
became
a
wandering
knight,
renowned
across
the
land.
That
is,
until
the
day
a
spell
of
summoning
grabbed
him
from
his
home
and
deposited
him
on
Runeterra

Now,
Taric
misses
his
world,
though
he
is
happy
to
fight
in
the
League
,
protecting
all
who
are
in
need.
&quot;As
Taric's
father
taught
him,
every
stone
has
its
meaning.
For
Taric's
enemies,
they
all
mean
trouble.&quot;

There
is
a
form
of
magic
unknown
to
many
Runeterrans
and
discredited
by
the
few
who
are
even
aware
of
its
existence.
It
is
the
magic
of
the
earth,
drawing
power
from
the
resonance
of
crystals
and
gems.
Taric,
the
Gem
Knight,
is
Runeterra's
sole
practitioner
of
this
form
of
magic,
having
been
erratically
summoned
to
Runeterra
from
a
faraway
world.
Back
home,
Taric's
father
was
a
distinguished
healer
in
their
home
city.
Taric
was
always
interested
in
his
father's
pursuits,
even
from
a
young
age.
Despite
his
burgeoning
understanding
of
herbs,
plants,
and
animal
medicines,
it
was
the
power
of
gems
that
most
fascinated
the
growing
boy.
It
wasn't
long
before
Taric
had
exhausted
his
father's
coveted
library
and
set
out
on
a
path
of
his
own.
He
wanted
to
help
the
people,
but
not
simply
salving
their
wounds
and
curing
their
woes.
He
wasn't
to
be
a
healer,
but
a
defender
-
one
who
used
the
power
of
earth
to
preserve
and
protect.
Taric
became
a
wandering
knight,
renowned
across
his
homeland
as
a
guardian
of
the
just
until
the
day
a
spell
of
summoning
grabbed
him
from
his
home
and
deposited
him
on
Runeterra.
Though
disoriented
and
confused
at
first,
he
now
feels
that
the
continent
of
Valoran
is
in
need
of
someone
like
him.
Despite
missing
his
homeland,
Taric
is
happy
to
fight
in
the
League
,
serving
as
a
protector
for
all
who
seek
one.
His
neat
and
stylish
appearance
combined
with
his
shiny
bejeweled
armor
and
weapons
have
rapidly
made
him
a
celebrity
champion
of
the
League
of
Legends.
Valoran's
media,
for
some
reason,
has
taken
great
interest
in
his
personal
life.
While
open
about
his
life
as
a
champion
and
gracious
in
all
things,
Taric
is
tight-lipped
about
his
life
outside
the
League
and
prefers
his
privacy.
&quot;As
Taric's
father
taught
him,
every
stone
has
its
meaning.
For
Taric's
enemies,
they
all
mean
trouble.&quot;
Prior

There
is
an
ancient
form
of
magic,
forgotten
by
many
and
discarded
by
some.
It
is
the
magic
of
the
earth,
of
the
resonance
of
crystals
and
gems.
Taric's

was
a

their

from

on

.
Now,

protecting
all
who
are
in

       There is a form of magic unknown to many Runeterrans and discredited by the few who are even aware of its existence. It is the magic of the earth, drawing power from the resonance of crystals and gems. Taric, the Gem Knight, is Runeterra's sole practitioner of this form of magic, having been erratically summoned to Runeterra from a faraway world. Back home, Taric's father was a distinguished healer in their home city. Taric was always interested in his father's pursuits, even from a young age. Despite his burgeoning understanding of herbs, plants, and animal medicines, it was the power of gems that most fascinated the growing boy. It wasn't long before Taric had exhausted his father's coveted library and set out on a path of his own. He wanted to help the people, but not by simply salving their wounds and curing their woes. He wasn't to be a healer, but a defender - one who used the power of earth to preserve and protect. Taric became a wandering knight, renowned across his homeland as a guardian of the just until the day a spell of summoning grabbed him from his home and deposited him on Runeterra. Though disoriented and confused at first, he now feels that the continent of Valoran is in need of someone like him. Despite missing his homeland, Taric is happy to fight in the League, serving as a protector for all who seek one. His neat and stylish appearance combined with his shiny bejeweled armor and weapons have rapidly made him a celebrity champion of the League of Legends. Valoran's media, for some reason, has taken a great interest in his personal life. While open about his life as a champion and gracious in all things, Taric is tight-lipped about his life outside the League and prefers his privacy. As Taric's father taught him, every stone has its meaning. For Taric's enemies, they all mean trouble.

       A healer gifted with the magic of the stars, Soraka holds all living creatures close to her heart. She was once a celestial being, but she sacrificed her immortality and entered the world of mortals. So long as evil threatens life in Valoran, Soraka will not allow herself peace. Soraka lived for centuries in an enchanted grove. A being of the stars, she healed the wounded and sick that sought her out. One man called Warwick came to her grove and begged her to heal his wife, who lay lifeless in his arms. His despair touched Soraka's heart. Though it was too late to save his wife, she offered to help heal the pain of his loss. Unwilling to let go of his grief Warwick ran from the grove, but returned over the following days to hear Soraka's guidance. She began to grow attached to the grieving man. One day Warwick told her he had found the men who killed his wife. He believed revenge would heal his pain - and if he died fighting, he would at least find peace. Though she pleaded with him, Warwick ignored her and left the grove. The voices of the stars warned her not to follow him, but Soraka had to intervene. She stepped into the mortal world for the first time, and soon found Warwick desperately fighting a group of men. She tried to heal him, but for every wound she closed, the men inflicted two more. Soraka realized that she would have to fight to save her friend. The stars screamed in her mind, telling her not to use her powers for harm. Ignoring their warning, she struck the attackers with a flash of brilliant light. Crying out in terror and shielding their eyes from her divine radiance, they fled. Soraka's celestial form faded and the stars fell silent - for her transgression, she became mortal. She still felt the power of the stars within her, but they no longer offered her guidance. She took comfort in Warwick's safety, gently healing his wounds, but the man she had called her friend slipped a dagger between her ribs. As her blood spilled, Soraka realized he had fooled her, and everything he had done was a complicated ruse. Feeling humiliated and betrayed she called once more on the power of the stars, searing his flesh and cursing his cruelty. He retreated with an agonized howl, leaving Soraka to reflect upon her fate. Though her life had changed, she felt empowered and renewed with a singular purpose. No longer bound to the grove, Soraka set out into the mortal world, vowing to heal the wounded and protect the helpless. ''The cruelty of one will not blind me to the suffering of many.'' -- Soraka

Trivia
Skill
usage
Power
Chord
has
three
distinct
effects
based
on
Sona's
currently
active
aura.
Power
Chord
-
Staccato
will
deal
double
the
damage
of
Power
Chords
base
damage.
Charging
Power
Chord
three
times
with
Hymn
of
Valor
at
the
start
of
the
game
can
lead
to
an
advantage
fighting
in
the
brush
at
level
1.
(Use
Hymn
of
Valor
between
the
first
two
auto
attacks)
Power
Chord
-
Staccato
makes
Sona
a
good
early
game
harasser
.
Power
Chord
-
Diminuendo
will
apply
a
20%
damage
reduction
debuff
upon
a
target.
In
a
battle
using
Aria
of
Perseverance
along
with
Power
Chord
to
hit
the
enemy's
carry
can
help
turn
the
tides
of
the
fight.
Aria
of
Perseverance's
Power
Chord
also
affects
Dragon
.
Power
Chord
-
Tempo
will
apply
a
40%
slow
for
2
seconds.
Do
not
underestimate
the
movement
speed
buff
of
Song
of
Celerity
.
The
passive
aura
combined
with
its
AoE
active
can
give
a
very
large
speed
boost
to
Sona's
team.
This
combined
with
its
slow
from
Song
of
Celerity's
Power
Chord
can
make
it
very
difficult
to
catch/run
away
from
her
and
her
team.

Sona's
Hymn
of
Valor
is
very
strong
if
leveled
up
quickly.
However,
because
of
her
lack
of
escape
mechanisms
or
survivability
skills,
she
should
still
be
played
as
a
support
champion.
Leveling
first
is
great
for
aggressive
bot
lanes
due
to
Hymn
of
Valor's
passive
aura
granting
additional
AD
and
AP
as
well
as
providing
decent
harass
during
the
laning
phase.
In
a
passive
support
lane,
encourage
your
carry
to
trade
blows
with
the
opponent,
and
do
the
same
with
Hymn
of
Valor
and
Power
Chord
.
Afterwards,
heal
yourself
and
your
partner
with
Aria
of
Perseverance
.
This
will
wear
down
the
enemy
and
force
them
out
of
lane
in
less
time
and
mana
than
just
poking
with
Hymn
of
Valor
.
Use
Aria
of
Perseverance
when
an
ally
is
being
focused
in
order
to
take
advantage
of
the
bonus
armor
and
magic
resistance
.
Aria
of
Perseverance's
passive
aura
is
great
for
a
more
defensive
lane
and
also
for
team
fights
when
paired
with
Aegis
of
the
Legion
Stay
with
the
team.
Sona
makes
an
excellent
healer
,
Crescendo
is
best
used
when
the
whole
team
can
take
advantage
of
it,
and
Song
of
Celerity
lets
the
entire
team
kite.
Without
a
teammate
around,
Sona
is
little
more
than
an
easy
gank.
Early
game,
be
wary
of
constant
spell
rotation,
as
it
will
quickly
drain
her
mana.
However,
this
can
also
be
a
large
problem
mid
to
late
game
without
proper
itemization.
Crescendo
coupled
with
allies'
channeled
abilities
can
devastate
the
opposing
team,
as
while
stunned,
they
can't
interrupt
the
channel.
Build
usage
Being
a
support,
Sona
should
focus
on
supporting
her
AD
carry
early
game
by
warding
and
keeping
him/her
safe.
If
your
carry
can
get
last
hits,
you'll
want
to
leave
them
for
him/her.
You
can
offset
your
lack
of
farm
by
buying
Ancient
Coin
or
Spellthief's
Edge
for
more
sustain,
better
healing,
and
Gp10.
If
you
go
Sona
midlane,
you
usualy
need
to
keep
your
wards
up,
as
chance
to
escape
ganks,
when
not
warded,
is
limited,
and
basicaly
impossible
if
your
flash
is
down.
Getting
fast
Sheen
is
recomended,
as
well
as
getting
Chalice
of
Harmony
right
afterwards.
You
also
want
to
rotate
your
abilities,
in
order
to
have
2
stacks
of
your
passive
always
ready
to
punish
any
overextending
champion
with
Hymn
of
Valor
+
Sheen
+
Power
Chord
.
A
valuable
build
for
Sona
is
stacking
auras,
as
all
it
takes
is
Sona's
presence
for
her
to
be
useful
and
most
of
the
aura
items
you
should
be
getting
are
relatively
cheap.
The
combination
of
lvl
5
Hymn
of
Valor
and
Zeke's
Herald
gives
up
to
40
AD
and
10%
life
steal
to
her
close
allies.
The
combination
of
lvl
5
Aria
of
Perseverance
and
Aegis
of
the
Legion
gives
a
total
of
10
armor
and
30
MR
to
her
close
allies,
or
20
armor
and
40
MR
to
both
allies
while
Active.
Another
defensive
Aura
is
Frozen
Heart
.
Its
debuff
over
enemies
decreases
DPS
damage
output
of
enemy
team,
specially
from
enemy
AD
Carry.
It
can
be
used
in
combination
with
Power
Chord
-
Diminuendo
and
Exhaust
.
Other
offensive
Aura
is
Abyssal
Scepter
.
Its
debuff
over
enemies
increases
the
magic
damage
output
of
your
whole
team.
With
her
Song
of
Celerity
and
a
Talisman
of
Ascension
,
Sona
can
make
it
nearly
impossible
for
the
enemy
to
catch
a
dying
teammate
or
escape
from
her
team
during
a
chase.
These
two
things
also
allow
her
team
to
traverse
great
distances
very
quickly,
such
as
quickly
running
to
a
tower/inhibitor
after
an
ace
to
take
it
down
before
the
enemy
team
revives
or
moving
to
a
friendly
tower/inhib
to
prevent
it
from
being
taken.
All
of
Sona's
skills
(including
her
passive)
scale
with
AP
,
but
support
Sona
should
prioritize
cooldowns
over
AP
.
So
to
maximize
the
utility
of
her
skills,
passive
and
AoE
stun
of
Crescendo
Ionian
Boots
of
Lucidity
,
Fiendish
Codex
,
Athene's
Unholy
Grail
,
Banner
of
Command
,
Morellonomicon
,
Kindlegem
,
Zeke's
Herald
,
Locket
of
the
Iron
Solari
,
Frozen
Heart
and
Talisman
of
Ascension
are
good
options.
With
40%
cooldown
reduction
,
the
cooldown
of
Hymn
of
Valor
,
Aria
of
Perseverance
and
Song
of
Celerity
are
4,2
sec.
and
lvl
3
Crescendo
cooldown
is
60
sec.
As
midlaner,
on
the
other
hand,
AP
items
with
side
utility
should
be
prioritized,
while
getting
CDR
as
close
to
40%
as
possible.
Athene's
Unholy
Grail
is
a
must,
while
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
and
Liandry's
Torment
are
good
to
have
items
to
make
you
both
slightly
more
durable,
and
increase
power
of
your
poke.
Lich
Bane
,
another
useful
item,
is
however
ignored
by
some
in
order
to
achieve
higher
AP
and
therefore
stronger
teamfight
impact,
sacrifying
personal
power
for
stronger
supportive
power.
Sona
is
extremely
valuable
in
group
pushes,
but
sustained
aura
rotation
can
deplete
her
mana
pool
quickly
if
not
equipped
properly,
consider
mana
regeneration
glyphs
per
level
to
make
sure
she
never
runs
out
of
mana.
Because
Sona
has
generally
low
cooldowns
,
low
mana
costs,
and
needs
to
constantly
switch
abilities,
she
charges
up
Seraph's
Embrace
faster
than
almost
any
other
champion.
This
also
helps
her,
as
it
provides
one
of
the
highest
mana
regens
in
the
game,
allows
her
to
stay
in
long
team
pushes
for
much
longer,
and
gives
her
a
small
shield
for
incoming
burst.
Mejai's
Soulstealer
,
while
not
always
viable,
generally
charges
up
quickly
as
long
as
you
stay
safe.
As
long
as
she
has
an
aura
active,
Sona
gets
assists
for
simply
being
at
teamfights.
With
40%
Cooldown
Reduction,
Sona
can
keep
stacks
of
Guinsoo's
Rageblade
up
easily.
Lich
Bane
can
add
a
significant
amount
of
damage
to
her
autoattack.
Combined
with
Power
Chord
it
can
provide
decent
burst
damage.

Sona
is
fairly
squishy
throughout
the
game,
especially
at
level
1.
Work
with
your
allies
to
kill
her
fast.
When
laning
against
Sona
,
be
sure
to
play
safe
as
she
can
boost
her
partner
with
her
supporting
spells.
All
of
Sona
's
active
stances
are
AoE
,
meaning
that
you
can
avoid
her
spells
by
moving
away
from
her.
Do
not
overextend
when
chasing
an
enemy
that
is
accompanied
with
Sona
.
Her
Song
of
Celerity
allows
her
to
outrun
you
very
quickly.
During
teamfights
try
to
kill
Sona
first,
since
she
provides
consistent
damage/defense
boosting
auras
through
the
teamfight,
as
well
as
an
AoE
stun.

Skill
usage
Power
Chord
has
three
distinct
effects
based
on
Sona's
currently
active
aura.
Power
Chord
-
Staccato
will
deal
double
the
damage
of
Power
Chords
base
damage.
Charging
Power
Chord
three
times
with
Hymn
of
Valor
at
the
start
of
the
game
can
lead
to
an
advantage
fighting
in
the
brush
at
level
1.
(Use
Hymn
of
Valor
between
the
first
two
auto
attacks)
Power
Chord
-
Staccato
makes
Sona
a
good
early
game
harasser
.
Power
Chord
-
Diminuendo
will
apply
a
20%
damage
reduction
debuff
upon
a
target.
In
a
battle
using
Aria
of
Perseverance
along
with
Power
Chord
to
hit
the
enemy's
carry
can
help
turn
the
tides
of
the
fight.
Aria
of
Perseverance's
Power
Chord
also
affects
Dragon
.
Power
Chord
-
Tempo
will
apply
a
40%
slow
for
2
seconds.
Do
not
underestimate
the
movement
speed
buff
of
Song
of
Celerity
.
The
passive
aura
combined
with
its
AoE
active
can
give
a
very
large
speed
boost
to
Sona's
team.
This
combined
with
its
slow
from
Song
of
Celerity's
Power
Chord
can
make
it
very
difficult
to
catch/run
away
from
her
and
her
team.

Sona's
Hymn
of
Valor
is
very
strong
if
leveled
up
quickly.
However,
because
of
her
lack
of
escape
mechanisms
or
survivability
skills,
she
should
still
be
played
as
a
support
champion.
Leveling
first
is
great
for
aggressive
bot
lanes
due
to
Hymn
of
Valor's
passive
aura
granting
additional
AD
and
AP
as
well
as
providing
decent
harass
during
the
laning
phase.
In
a
passive
support
lane,
encourage
your
carry
to
trade
blows
with
the
opponent,
and
do
the
same
with
Hymn
of
Valor
and
Power
Chord
.
Afterwards,
heal
yourself
and
your
partner
with
Aria
of
Perseverance
.
This
will
wear
down
the
enemy
and
force
them
out
of
lane
in
less
time
and
mana
than
just
poking
with
Hymn
of
Valor
.
Use
Aria
of
Perseverance
when
an
ally
is
being
focused
in
order
to
take
advantage
of
the
bonus
armor
and
magic
resistance
.
Aria
of
Perseverance's
passive
aura
is
great
for
a
more
defensive
lane
and
also
for
team
fights
when
paired
with
Aegis
of
the
Legion
Stay
with
the
team.
Sona
makes
an
excellent
healer
,
Crescendo
is
best
used
when
the
whole
team
can
take
advantage
of
it,
and
Song
of
Celerity
lets
the
entire
team
kite.
Without
a
teammate
around,
Sona
is
little
more
than
an
easy
gank.
Early
game,
be
wary
of
constant
spell
rotation,
as
it
will
quickly
drain
her
mana.
However,
this
can
also
be
a
large
problem
mid
to
late
game
without
proper
itemization.
Crescendo
coupled
with
allies'
channeled
abilities
can
devastate
the
opposing
team,
as
while
stunned,
they
can't
interrupt
the
channel.
Build
usage
Being
a
support,
Sona
should
focus
on
supporting
her
AD
carry
early
game
by
warding
and
keeping
him/her
safe.
If
your
carry
can
get
last
hits,
you'll
want
to
leave
them
for
him/her.
You
can
offset
your
lack
of
farm
by
buying
Ancient
Coin
or
Spellthief's
Edge
for
more
sustain,
better
healing,
and
Gp10.
If
you
go
Sona
midlane,
you
usualy
need
to
keep
your
wards
up,
as
chance
to
escape
ganks,
when
not
warded,
is
limited,
and
basicaly
impossible
if
your
flash
is
down.
Getting
fast
Sheen
is
recomended,
as
well
as
getting
Chalice
of
Harmony
right
afterwards.
You
also
want
to
rotate
your
abilities,
in
order
to
have
2
stacks
of
your
passive
always
ready
to
punish
any
overextending
champion
with
Hymn
of
Valor
+
Sheen
+
Power
Chord
.
A
valuable
build
for
Sona
is
stacking
auras,
as
all
it
takes
is
Sona's
presence
for
her
to
be
useful
and
most
of
the
aura
items
you
should
be
getting
are
relatively
cheap.
The
combination
of
lvl
5
Hymn
of
Valor
and
Zeke's
Herald
gives
up
to
40
AD
and
10%
life
steal
to
her
close
allies.
The
combination
of
lvl
5
Aria
of
Perseverance
and
Aegis
of
the
Legion
gives
a
total
of
10
armor
and
30
MR
to
her
close
allies,
or
20
armor
and
40
MR
to
both
allies
while
Active.
Another
defensive
Aura
is
Frozen
Heart
.
Its
debuff
over
enemies
decreases
DPS
damage
output
of
enemy
team,
specially
from
enemy
AD
Carry.
It
can
be
used
in
combination
with
Power
Chord
-
Diminuendo
and
Exhaust
.
Other
offensive
Aura
is
Abyssal
Scepter
.
Its
debuff
over
enemies
increases
the
magic
damage
output
of
your
whole
team.
With
her
Song
of
Celerity
and
a
Talisman
of
Ascension
,
Sona
can
make
it
nearly
impossible
for
the
enemy
to
catch
a
dying
teammate
or
escape
from
her
team
during
a
chase.
These
two
things
also
allow
her
team
to
traverse
great
distances
very
quickly,
such
as
quickly
running
to
a
tower/inhibitor
after
an
ace
to
take
it
down
before
the
enemy
team
revives
or
moving
to
a
friendly
tower/inhib
to
prevent
it
from
being
taken.
All
of
Sona's
skills
(including
her
passive)
scale
with
AP
,
but
support
Sona
should
prioritize
cooldowns
over
AP
.
So
to
maximize
the
utility
of
her
skills,
passive
and
AoE
stun
of
Crescendo
Ionian
Boots
of
Lucidity
,
Fiendish
Codex
,
Athene's
Unholy
Grail
,
Banner
of
Command
,
Morellonomicon
,
Kindlegem
,
Zeke's
Herald
,
Locket
of
the
Iron
Solari
,
Frozen
Heart
and
Talisman
of
Ascension
are
good
options.
With
40%
cooldown
reduction
,
the
cooldown
of
Hymn
of
Valor
,
Aria
of
Perseverance
and
Song
of
Celerity
are
4,2
sec.
and
lvl
3
Crescendo
cooldown
is
60
sec.
As
midlaner,
on
the
other
hand,
AP
items
with
side
utility
should
be
prioritized,
while
getting
CDR
as
close
to
40%
as
possible.
Athene's
Unholy
Grail
is
a
must,
while
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
and
Liandry's
Torment
are
good
to
have
items
to
make
you
both
slightly
more
durable,
and
increase
power
of
your
poke.
Lich
Bane
,
another
useful
item,
is
however
ignored
by
some
in
order
to
achieve
higher
AP
and
therefore
stronger
teamfight
impact,
sacrifying
personal
power
for
stronger
supportive
power.
Sona
is
extremely
valuable
in
group
pushes,
but
sustained
aura
rotation
can
deplete
her
mana
pool
quickly
if
not
equipped
properly,
consider
mana
regeneration
glyphs
per
level
to
make
sure
she
never
runs
out
of
mana.
Because
Sona
has
generally
low
cooldowns
,
low
mana
costs,
and
needs
to
constantly
switch
abilities,
she
charges
up
Seraph's
Embrace
faster
than
almost
any
other
champion.
This
also
helps
her,
as
it
provides
one
of
the
highest
mana
regens
in
the
game,
allows
her
to
stay
in
long
team
pushes
for
much
longer,
and
gives
her
a
small
shield
for
incoming
burst.
Mejai's
Soulstealer
,
while
not
always
viable,
generally
charges
up
quickly
as
long
as
you
stay
safe.
As
long
as
she
has
an
aura
active,
Sona
gets
assists
for
simply
being
at
teamfights.
With
40%
Cooldown
Reduction,
Sona
can
keep
stacks
of
Guinsoo's
Rageblade
up
easily.
Lich
Bane
can
add
a
significant
amount
of
damage
to
her
autoattack.
Combined
with
Power
Chord
it
can
provide
decent
burst
damage.

Sona
is
fairly
squishy
throughout
the
game,
especially
at
level
1.
Work
with
your
allies
to
kill
her
fast.
When
laning
against
Sona
,
be
sure
to
play
safe
as
she
can
boost
her
partner
with
her
supporting
spells.
All
of
Sona
's
active
stances
are
AoE
,
meaning
that
you
can
avoid
her
spells
by
moving
away
from
her.
Do
not
overextend
when
chasing
an
enemy
that
is
accompanied
with
Sona
.
Her
Song
of
Celerity
allows
her
to
outrun
you
very
quickly.
During
teamfights
try
to
kill
Sona
first,
since
she
provides
consistent
damage/defense
boosting
auras
through
the
teamfight,
as
well
as
an
AoE
stun.

Champion
A
healer
gifted
with
the
magic
of
the
stars,
Soraka
holds
all
living
creatures
close
to
her
heart.
She
was
once
a
celestial
being,
but
she
sacrificed
her
immortality
and
entered
the
world
of
mortals.
So
long
as
evil
threatens
life
in
Valoran
,
Soraka
will
not
allow
herself
peace.
Soraka
lived
for
centuries
in
an
enchanted
grove.
A
being
of
the
stars,
she
healed
the
wounded
and
sick
that
sought
her
out.
One
man
called
Warwick
came
to
her
grove
and
begged
her
to
heal
his
wife,
who
lay
lifeless
in
his
arms.
His
despair
touched
Soraka's
heart.
Though
it
was
too
late
to
save
his
wife,
she
offered
to
help
heal
the
pain
of
his
loss.
Unwilling
to
let
go
of
his
grief
Warwick
ran
from
the
grove,
but
returned
over
the
following
days
to
hear
Soraka's
guidance.
She
began
to
grow
attached
to
the
grieving
man.
One
day
Warwick
told
her
he
had
found
the
men
who
killed
his
wife.
He
believed
revenge
would
heal
his
pain

and
if
he
died
fighting,
he
would
at
least
find
peace.
Though
she
pleaded
with
him,
Warwick
ignored
her
and
left
the
grove.
The
voices
of
the
stars
warned
her
not
to
follow
him,
but
Soraka
had
to
intervene.
She
stepped
into
the
mortal
world
for
the
first
time,
and
soon
found
Warwick
desperately
fighting
a
group
of
men.
She
tried
to
heal
him,
but
for
every
wound
she
closed,
the
men
inflicted
two
more.
Soraka
realized
that
she
would
have
to
fight
to
save
her
friend.
The
stars
screamed
in
her
mind,
telling
her
not
to
use
her
powers
for
harm.
Ignoring
their
warning,
she
struck
the
attackers
with
a
flash
of
brilliant
light.
Crying
out
in
terror
and
shielding
their
eyes
from
her
divine
radiance,
they
fled.
Soraka's
celestial
form
faded
and
the
stars
fell
silent

for
her
transgression,
she
became
mortal.
She
still
felt
the
power
of
the
stars
within
her,
but
they
no
longer
offered
her
guidance.
She
took
comfort
in
Warwick's
safety,
gently
healing
his
wounds,
but
the
man
she
had
called
her
friend
slipped
a
dagger
between
her
ribs.
As
her
blood
spilled,
Soraka
realized
he
had
fooled
her,
and
everything
he
had
done
was
a
complicated
ruse.
Feeling
humiliated
and
betrayed
she
called
once
more
on
the
power
of
the
stars,
searing
his
flesh
and
cursing
his
cruelty.
He
retreated
with
an
agonized
howl,
leaving
Soraka
to
reflect
upon
her
fate.
Though
her
life
had
changed,
she
felt
empowered
and
renewed
with
a
singular
purpose.
No
longer
bound
to
the
grove,
Soraka
set
out
into
the
mortal
world,
vowing
to
heal
the
wounded
and
protect
the
helpless.
&quot;The
cruelty
of
one
will
not
blind
me
to
the
suffering
of
many.&quot;

Soraka
Soraka's
lore
was
officially
updated
on
September
18
th
,
2012
.
[1]
Soraka,
the
Starchild
of
Ionia
,
was
the
first
of
her
kind.
While
there
are
many
who
tap
into
the
rich
magical
energies
of
Valoran
,
she
was
the
first
to
tap
into
the
magic
of
the
cosmos
itself

the
celestial
sea
in
which
it
is
theorized
that
Runeterra
swims
among
other
like
bodies.
While
Runeterran
magicians
are
limited
by
the
finite
(though
tremendous)
powers
of
runes,
there
have
always
been
those
who
have
searched
to
go
further.
Reaching
beyond
the
terrestrial
firmament
of
Runeterra,
Soraka
was
capable
of
invoking
the
power
of
the
stars,
evolving
beyond
her
kin.
This
power
has
changed
her
in
fantastical
ways

it
is
for
this
reason
that
she
became
known
as
the
Starchild.
Though
Soraka
was
once
trans-human,
Soraka
has
fallen
since
she
let
the
most
primal
of
emotions
rule
her.
Warwick
,
a
mercenary
chemist
in
the
service
of
Noxus
,
had
caused
untold
suffering
and
death
among
Soraka's
people.
An
alchemical
genius
who
took
no
responsibility
for
the
atrocities
he'd
caused,
Warwick
became
known
as
&quot;the
Deathmaker&quot;
by
the
Ionian
people.
As
Noxian
murder
and
terror
pushed
ever-forward
across
her
land,
unstoppable
anger
and
hatred
welled
within
Soraka.
She
called
down
the
power
of
the
heavens
to
curse
and
forever
change
the
Deathmaker,
and
she
mutated
the
man
into
a
werewolf

a
wild,
murderous
beast.
For
this
misstep,
Soraka
lost
much
of
her
power,
sacrificing
her
trans-human
ascension
and
sliding
several
steps
down
the
evolutionary
ladder
in
an
instant.
Though
she
is
still
a
champion
of
the
Ionian
people,
Soraka
has
joined
the
League
of
Legends
in
hopes
of
reversing
her
curse
and
redeeming
herself
in
the
eyes
of
the
stars.
&quot;Though
having
fallen
from
grace,
Soraka
is
nonetheless
determined
to
once
again
be
one
with
the
stars.&quot;

into
stardust
before
readying
for
her
return
to
the
Fields
of
Justice.

Skill
usage
Soraka
's
strength
derives
from
being
able
to
sustain
her
allies
in
prolonged
fights
with
Salvation
enhancing
her
heals,
but
suffers
from
low
mobility
and
durability,
and
is
therefore
very
reliant
on
her
allies
for
damage
and
engages.
Soraka
lanes
well
with
and
against
AP
champions
(casters);
Infuse
will
allow
you
to
have
more
control
over
your
lane
against
them
and
Starcall's
debuff
will
help
increase
the
damage
of
your
AP
partner
and
Infuse
will
help
mana
constraints.
Infuse
is
quite
powerful
early
game,
making
Soraka
an
unusual
mid
solo
laner.
Maxing
Infuse
gives
powerful
harassment
as
well
as
having
a
range
significantly
superior
to
most
of
other
single-targeted
abilities
in
game.
Starting
with
an
Infuse
and
follow
up
with
Starcall
offers
strong
harassment,
and
a
second
Starcall
can
be
used
when
Infuse
is
at
max
level
without
fear
of
counter-attack.
Infuse
is
devastating
for
mages
who
have
to
perform
perfect
spell
chains
or
combos
to
be
effective,
such
as
Ryze
or
Malzahar
as
it
instantly
interrupts
their
ability
chain
and
allows
Soraka
to
kill/escape
from
her
opponent.
Keeping
a
single
point
at
Astral
Blessing
while
playing
as
mid
can
remove
between
all
to
a
portion
of
the
harassment
you
might
take
while
not
being
mana-devastating
to
Soraka
due
to
it's
affordable
cost
at
rank
one.
Due
to
Salvation
,
Soraka
's
abilities
are
most
potent
when
your
allies
are
at
low
health.
This
proves
most
effective
in
baiting
enemies
into
committing
to
a
bad
fight.
Leveling
up
Starcall
early
may
limit
your
utility,
but
it
can
help
you
harass
better
than
many
other
champions
in
the
game
and
it
lets
you
farm
up
money
for
items
more
easily.
You
should
level
up
Starcall
when
your
team
is
completely
in
control
of
the
lane
and
you
want
to
keep
the
pressure
on,
or
want
to
farm
up
a
lot
of
gold.
Soraka
is
extremely
strong
in
the
laning
phase.
Getting
one
point
in
Starcall
while
laning
allows
for
powerful
harassment
,
denying
creep
farming.
Using
Infuse
to
harass
allows
for
a
strong
push.
Since
she
can
heal
herself,
playing
aggressively
can
be
rewarding,
as
long
as
you
are
not
being
overly
reckless.
Starcall
uses
very
little
mana
at
level
one
and
has
a
short
cooldown,
which
makes
it
effective
for
farming.
It
can
only
be
cast
when
a
target
is
in
range.
If
there
is
a
stealthed
enemy
(whether
by
ability
or
by
being
hidden
in
brush)
within
range
they
can
be
targeted.
Don't
forget
that
Starcall
reduces
enemy
magic
resist
.
The
stacking
reduction
per
cast
will
make
a
difference
if
your
team
has
magic
damage,
but
don't
risk
your
life
to
get
in
Starcall's
short
range.
The
magic
reduction
also
increases
your
damage
if
you
need
to
fight.
Keep
the
magic
resistance
reduction
in
mind
because
you
never
know
when
getting
in
a
Starcall
before
Infuse
rather
than
after
will
just
barely
give
you
enough
bonus
damage
to
score
a
kill.
Cast
Starcall
before
Infuse
to
penetrate
high
amounts
of
enemy
magic
resistance
and
deal
more
damage.
Leveling
up
Astral
Blessing
early
will
be
the
most
taxing
option
for
Soraka
as
far
as
mana
consumption
goes,
but
after
a
few
levels,
it
allows
her
and
her
teammate
to
shrug
off
all
but
the
most
tenacious
harassment.
You
should
level
up
Astral
Blessing
when
you
and/or
your
teammate
constantly
find
yourself
at
low
health,
or
are
constantly
being
harassed
but
you
aren't
having
mana
problems.
On
the
off-chance
that
you
find
yourself
leading
a
solo
push
against
a
tower,
consider
using
Astral
Blessing
on
a
Siege
Minion
.
These
minions
take
reduced
damage
from
towers,
so
healing
it
and
buffing
its
armor
can
increase
its
longevity
by
a
substantial
amount.
Leveling
up
Infuse
early
is
probably
the
most
balanced
approach.
Infuse
has
both
offensive
and
defensive
uses
for
Soraka.
You
should
level
up
Infuse
if
your
teammate
is
constantly
running
low
on
mana
or
if
you
are
laning
with
a
champion
who
would
appreciate
the
ability
to
cast
spells
constantly
such
as
Brand
.
Take
advantage
of
Infuse
's
silence
to
further
harass
enemies
with
Starcall
or
to
heal
yourself
with
Astral
Blessing
so
as
to
continue
pressure.
Late
game,
Infuse
should
be
used
on
enemies
with
channeling
spells
that
deal
a
great
amount
of
damage
such
as
Katarina's
Death
Lotus
for
the
silence
rather
than
restoring
allies'
mana.
Using
Infuse
against
champions
that
rely
on
spell
combos
or
escape
abilities
is
very
effective.
For
example,
Annie
relies
on
a
stun
and
burst.
A
well-placed
silence
between
will
let
the
stun
victim
escape
without
harm.
This
can
also
work
&quot;aggressively&quot;,
silencing
champions
with
strong
escape
abilities
such
as
Vladimir
,
LeBlanc
,
Kayle
,
and
Poppy
.
You
can
cast
Wish
on
your
allies
from
across
the
map
to
save
them
from
otherwise
fatal
events.
Keep
an
eye
on
their
health
bars
on
the
left
side
of
the
screen
and
cast
when
appropriate.
This
is
also
an
effective
way
to
grab
assists,
even
if
your
allies
aren't
in
absolute
danger.
If
you
are
playing
an
arranged
team,
Soraka
can
be
extremely
useful
due
to
her
ultimate.
Keep
in
mind
not
to
get
too
greedy
as
Soraka
's
abilities
do
have
a
somewhat
low
range.
Be
careful
when
playing
against
champions
that
can
reduce
your
healing
ability,
such
as
Miss
Fortune
,
Fizz
,
Tristana
or
Katarina
.
Similarly,
watch
for
enemy
champions
with
Morellonomicon
,
as
they
can
greatly
reduce
your
heals'
effectiveness
on
low
health
allies.
Soraka
lanes
extremely
well
with
Kassadin
for
multiple
reasons:
Force
Pulse
needs
6
stacks
for
it
to
be
usable.
Starcall
can
easily
charge
this
because
of
its
ridiculously
short
cooldown.
Riftwalk
uses
a
lot
of
mana
especially
with
its
stacking
mana
cost.
Infuse
can
quickly
restore
it.
Null
Sphere
can
be
used
to
silence
your
target
after
the
silence
from
Infuse
expires.
The
bonus
armor
and
heal
from
Astral
Blessing
can
help
Kassadin
greatly
since
he
is
a
melee
mage
.
Stay
with
your
teammates.
Soraka
has
no
escaping
abilities,
and
is
little
more
than
a
free
gank
without
your
team
around.
Build
usage
Astral
Blessing
,
Infuse
and
Wish
give
Soraka
assists
when
used
on
allies,
making
Mejai's
Soulstealer
a
good
choice
if
you
play
carefully.
Soraka
is
an
excellent
pick
vs
Galio
because
her
Starcall
heavily
reduces
magic
resist.
Because
Galio
's
passive
gives
AP
based
off
of
his
MR,
you
can
heavily
debuff
him
to
reduce
his
AP
and
MR
throughout
a
teamfight.
She
also
is
a
common
pick
vs
Karthus
,
as
Wish
is
a
perfect
counter
to
Requiem
.
Getting
items
with
effective
auras,
like
a
Emblem
of
Valor
,
allow
her
to
further
benefit
her
team.
All
of
Soraka's
healing
abilities
(
Astral
Blessing
:
35%,
Wish
:
55%)
have
low
AP
scaling,
but
spike
as
her
allies
drop
in
health,
thanks
to
Salvation
.
You
can
also
build
her
tanky
if
your
team
has
no
need
of
a
powerful
healer
It
also
makes
seemingly
aggressive
items
like
Rabadon's
Deathcap
defensively
potent.
At
1380,
Soraka
has
the
fifth
larger
mana
pool
in
game,
and
taking
in
count
how
spammable
Starcall
is,
charging
an
Archangel's
Staff
can
be
quite
easy
and
powerful
no
to
mention
that
it
will
greatly
help
against
the
huge
mana
tax
of
Astral
Blessing
.
The
extra
AP
increases
her
heals
and
the
Seraph's
Embrace
shield
is
a
free
barrier
when
her
heal
is
down,
and
helps
with
her
natural
squishyness.
Additionally,
as
Infuse
scales
off
of
her
maximum
mana
both
offensively
and
defensively,
an
Archangel's
Staff
will
improve
the
potency
of
that
ability.
One
option
for
Soraka
in
especially
long
games
is
Lich
Bane
,
since
all
the
stats
are
relatively
useful
on
her.
Even
without
penetration
runes,
she
can
spam
Starcall
and
attack
in
between
casts
which
results
in
considerable
sustained
damage
throughout
a
teamfight.
By
late
game,
Soraka's
heals
can
be
exceptionally
powerful.
When
this
happens,
the
other
team
may
start
focusing
Soraka,
so
grabbing
an
item
like
Guardian
Angel
or
Zhonya's
Hourglass
can
keep
you
alive
long
enough
for
your
heals
to
come
off
cooldown.
Most
of
Soraka's
base
spell
power
and
AP
ratios
are
directed
towards
healing
her
teammates
rather
than
damaging
enemies.
This
makes
Ionian
Boots
of
Lucidity
or
Boots
of
Swiftness
her
&quot;offensive&quot;
boots
of
choice
over
Sorcerer's
Shoes
,
since
they
increase
her
ability
to
close
into
spell
range
and/or
spam
once
there.
A
common
tactic
is
to
maximize
cooldown
reduction.
This
can
be
done
very
efficiently
with
10
or
5%
from
masteries,
depending
on
whether
you
go
9/0/21
or
0/9/21,
15%
from
Ionian
Boots
of
Lucidity
,
and
20%
from
Morellonomicon
.
A
less-AP-focused,
more
expensive
method
that
is
arguably
more
&quot;supportive&quot;
and
tanky
is
to
take
10
or
5%
from
masteries,
Talisman
of
Ascension
,
and
Spirit
Visage
.
Alternatively,
buying
a
Morellonomicon
and
a
Talisman
of
Ascension
(in
combination
with
CDR
from
masteries)
will
max
out
the
stat,
and
leave
you
room
to
buy
Boots
of
Mobility
or
Mercury's
Treads
.
Versus
aggressive
lanes,
the
ideal
mastery
setup
is
1/13/16
or
0/14/16
depending
on
whether
you
take
exhaust
or
heal
as
a
summoner.
Because
Soraka
has
no
inherent
CC,
if
your
team
is
lacking
peel
it
can
be
invaluable
to
pick
up
a
Twin
Shadows
or
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
in
addition
to
a
Talisman
of
Ascension
to
maximize
utility
for
your
carries.
Twin
Shadows
is
more
useful
for
helping
your
carries
chase
low
hp
opponents
as
well
as
giving
you
MS
and
MR.
Two
potential
items
available
to
Soraka
are
Mikael's
Crucible
and
Ohmwrecker
.
Crucible
is
good
when
playing
against
a
team
with
a
lot
of
hard
CC,
and
is
good
for
its
additional
heal.
This
means
you
could
potentially
have
Astral
Blessing
,
Wish
,
the
Summoner
spell
Heal,
and
Mikael's
Crucible
.
Ohmwrecker
is
useful
if
your
team
is
running
a
dive
comp,
with
champions
such
as
Singed
,
Diana
,
Kassadin
,
Akali
,
Maokai
,
or
you
find
your
team
is
constantly
pushing
but
unable
to
actually
get
to
the
tower.
Since
Infuse
can
no
longer
self-target,
mana
regeneration
is
another
key
consideration.
Chalice
of
Harmony's
unique
passive
will
grant
you
the
much
needed
mana
regeneration
to
use
abilities.
It
can
later
be
upgraded
into
an
Athene's
Unholy
Grail
increasing
its
base
mana
regeneration
,
magic
resistance
,
granting
bonus
cooldown
reduction
and
high
ability
power
providing
you
the
highest
possible
MP5
rate
when
you
have
next
to
no
mana
making
it
an
extremely
cost-efficient
item
on
Soraka
.
Tear
of
the
Goddess'
unique
passive
synergizes
well
with
Starcall
,
and
its
bonuses
will
not
be
lost
if
you
evolve
it
into
Archangel's
Staff
,
which
provides
the
second-highest
MP5
rate.
While
it
is
not
available
on
Summoner's
Rift
,
when
playing
on
Crystal
Scar
and
The
Twisted
Treeline
Soraka
has
access
to
the
Blackfire
Torch
.
This
item
is
powerful
on
her
when
combined
with
Starcall
,
which
not
only
applies
the
DoT
debuff
to
every
enemy
nearby
but
can
also
be
repeatedly
spammed
to
maintain
it
constantly.
Combined
with
the
MR
shred
on
Starcall
and
the
bonus
MR
penetration
on
the
item
itself,
as
well
as
the
bonus
CDR,
it
can
make
Soraka
an
incredibly
high
DPS
mage
even
without
much
AP.
Enemies
who
aren't
building
large
amounts
of
MR
can
end
up
taking
HP%-based
True
damage
and
those
who
build
none
at
all
can
be
reduced
to
negative
MR
by
Starcall
,
causing
them
to
take
even
more
damage
than
usual.
To
take
advantage
of
this,
Soraka
needs
staying
power
so
she
can
get
as
many
Starcall
s
off
as
possible.
Items
like
Abyssal
Scepter
,
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
and
Wooglet's
Witchcap
both
give
her
this
survivability
and
also
synergize
well
with
her
build,
giving
her
respectively
MR
and
further
MR
reduction,
HP
and
a
slow
on
her
abilities
to
facilitate
kiting
and
chasing,
and
AP
and
the
stasis
active
ability
which
can
give
her
the
few
seconds
she
needs
for
her
cooldowns
to
refresh
again.
With
a
combination
of
these
items,
Soraka
can
actually
be
a
lethal
source
of
damage
on
the
Crystal
Scar
and
The
Twisted
Treeline
.

Starcall
is
spammable
and
reduces
your
magic
resistance
whenever
it
hits
you,
but
it
has
moderately
short
range.
Either
try
to
stay
away
from
her
outright
during
laning
phase
so
she
won't
be
able
to
harass
you,
or
wait
for
the
magic

debuff
to
fade
before
closing
in
again.
Keep
yourself
outside
of
the
range
of
the
spell
early
on
as
she
can
use
it
to
refresh
Astral
Blessing
.
Soraka
is
the
only
champion
in
game
capable
of
reliably
performing
burst
healing
(restoring
immense
amounts
of
health
in
a
split
second).
This
is
particularly
troublesome
in
an
early
2v2
fight
in
the
bottom
lane
if
you
lack
Grievous
Wounds,
not
to
mention
that
Astral
Blessing
makes
her
target
very
resistant
to
physical
damage
if
you
don't
have
a
significant
amount
of
armor
penetration
(which
is
rare
early
on).
She
can
only
provide
the
armor
buff
to
a
single
target,
so
focus
another
until
it
expires.
Having
an
ability
power-based
jungler
can
also
help.
Always
have
an
Ignite
or
Executioner's
Calling
ready
whenever
you
are
going
to
engage
an
enemy
that
have
Soraka
in
their
team
in
order
to
reduce
the
effects
of
her
two
healing
abilities.
Also,
Try
to
build
a
Last
Whisper
to
counter
the
immense
armor
buff
from
Astral
Blessing
.
Even
if
Soraka
is
not
nearby,
consider
using
Executioner's
Calling
or
Ignite
on
your
target
when
they
are
about
to
die
to
reduce
the
healing
they
receive
from
Wish
.
Champions
that
have
abilities
which
inflict
Grievous
Wounds
(e.g.
Tristana
and
Katarina
)
have
a
greater
chance
to
kill
targets
with
a
Soraka
on
the
other
team.
