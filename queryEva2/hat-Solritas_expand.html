<b>Deathcap</b>
in
the
Patch
Day
Preview.
This
is
a
tribute
<b>to</b>
one
of
Riot&#x27;s
employees
named
Banksy
(David
Banks,
Director
of
Platform
Engineering).
The
image
artwork
would
seem
<b>to</b>
be
based
off
of
the
Sorting
<b>Hat</b>     ... 
large
margin.
It
is
<b>also</b>
somewhat
difficult
<b>to</b>
build
early
in
the
game
<b>as</b>
one
of
its
components
is
quite
expensive,
making
it
difficult
<b>to</b>
purchase
without
kills
or
other
gold
income.
Patch
History
V4.1     ... 
powerful
item
for
pure
ability
power
casters,
and
is
<b>also</b>
very
effective
on
burst
assassins
and
hybrid
champions
that
take
advantage
of
Lich
Bane
for
additional
burst.

Rabadon's
Deathcap
is
essential
for
any
champion
with
ablility
power
ratios,
tanky
or
carry,
wishing
to
deal
significant
magic
damage
that
will
carry
into
late
game.
Rabadon's

multiplicatively
with
Archmage
,
contentiously
stacking
on
top
of
each
other
until
the

are
too
small
to
be

Trivia
This
item
resulted
from
a
separation
of
the
offensive
and
defensive
abilities
of
Zhonya's
Ring
.
This
is
the
offensive
item,
while
Zhonya's
Hourglass
is
its
defensive
counterpart.
It
was
originally
named
Banksy's
Deathcap
in
the
Patch
Day
Preview.
This
is
a
tribute
to
one
of
Riot's
employees
named
Banksy
(David
Banks,
Director
of
Platform
Engineering).
The
image
artwork
would
seem
to
be
based
off
of
the
Sorting
Hat
from
the
Harry
Potter
franchise.
There
are
eyes
and
a
mouth-like
band
visible
on
the
hat,
very
similar
to
the
Sorting
Hat.
Not
counting
other
ability
power
items
,
runes
,
and
masteries
Rabadon's
Deathcap
gives
156
ability
power
alone.
The
upgrade
from
its
parts
grants
36
AP.
While
it
has
the
potential
to
be
the
single
highest
source
of
ability
power
in
the
game,
Rabadon's
Deathcap
is
rarely
purchased
first,
as
its
passive
ability
requires
other
ability
power
items
to
be
fully
effective,
to
the
point
of
the
item
being
barely
cost
effective,
which
the
large
majority
of
expensive
items
are
by
a
large
margin.
It
is
also
somewhat
difficult
to
build
early
in
the
game
as
one
of
its
components
is
quite
expensive,
making
it
difficult
to
purchase
without
kills
or
other
gold
income.

Trivia
This
item
resulted
from
a
separation
of
the
offensive
and
defensive
abilities
of
Zhonya's
Ring
.
This
is
the
offensive
item,
while
Zhonya's
Hourglass
is
its
defensive
counterpart.
It
was
originally
named
Banksy's
Deathcap
in
the
Patch
Day
Preview.
This
is
a
tribute
to
one
of
Riot's
employees
named
Banksy
(David
Banks,
Director
of
Platform
Engineering).
The
image
artwork
would
seem
to
be
based
off
of
the
Sorting
Hat
from
the
Harry
Potter
franchise.
There
are
eyes
and
a
mouth-like
band
visible
on
the
hat,
very
similar
to
the
Sorting
Hat.
Not
counting
other
ability
power
items
,
runes
,
and
masteries
Rabadon's
Deathcap
gives
156
ability
power
alone.
The
upgrade
from
its
parts
grants
36
AP.
While
it
has
the
potential
to
be
the
single
highest
source
of
ability
power
in
the
game,
Rabadon's
Deathcap
is
rarely
purchased
first,
as
its
passive
ability
requires
other
ability
power
items
to
be
fully
effective,
to
the
point
of
the
item
being
barely
cost
effective,
which
the
large
majority
of
expensive
items
are
by
a
large
margin.
It
is
also
somewhat
difficult
to
build
early
in
the
game
as
one
of
its
components
is
quite
expensive,
making
it
difficult
to
purchase
without
kills
or
other
gold
income.

Trivia
This
item
resulted
from
a
separation
of
the
offensive
and
defensive
abilities
of
Zhonya's
Ring
.
This
is
the
offensive
item,
while
Zhonya's
Hourglass
is
its
defensive
counterpart.
It
was
originally
named
Banksy's
Deathcap
in
the
Patch
Day
Preview.
This
is
a
tribute
to
one
of
Riot's
employees
named
Banksy
(David
Banks,
Director
of
Platform
Engineering).
The
image
artwork
would
seem
to
be
based
off
of
the
Sorting
Hat
from
the
Harry
Potter
franchise.
There
are
eyes
and
a
mouth-like
band
visible
on
the
hat,
very
similar
to
the
Sorting
Hat.
Not
counting
other
ability
power
items
,
runes
,
and
masteries
Rabadon's
Deathcap
gives
156
ability
power
alone.
The
upgrade
from
its
parts
grants
36
AP.
While
it
has
the
potential
to
be
the
single
highest
source
of
ability
power
in
the
game,
Rabadon's
Deathcap
is
rarely
purchased
first,
as
its
passive
ability
requires
other
ability
power
items
to
be
fully
effective,
to
the
point
of
the
item
being
barely
cost
effective,
which
the
large
majority
of
expensive
items
are
by
a
large
margin.
It
is
also
somewhat
difficult
to
build
early
in
the
game
as
one
of
its
components
is
quite
expensive,
making
it
difficult
to
purchase
without
kills
or
other
gold
income.

Attack
speed
(often
shortened
as
AS
or
ASPD
)
is
the
frequency
at
which
a
champion
performs
basic
attacks
and
are
displayed
as
&quot;attacks
per
second&quot;.
Attack
speed
caps
at
2.
5
attacks
per
second,
or
1
attack
every
two
fifths
of
a
second
(0.
4
seconds).
Attack
speed
bonuses
works
by
adding
a
percentage
of
a
champion's
base
attack
speed
to
his
or
her
&quot;base
attack
speed.&quot;
Champions
with
a
low
base
attack
speed
will
receive
less
of
an
attack
speed
boost
from
the
bonus
than
champions
with
a
high
base
attack
speed,
but
the
proportional
increase
in
DPS
will
remain
the
same
for
both.
One's
attack
speed
can
be
increased
via
leveling
up,
items
,
runes
,
masteries
,
buffs
,
and
abilities
.
One's
attack
speed
can
only
be
decreased
by
items
,
abilities,
and
the
Dragon
.

Calculations
Base
attack
speed
Every
champion's
base
attack
speed
(
AS
base
)
is
calculated
using
a
hidden
variable
called
attack
speed
offset,
which
ranges
from
0.
10
to
0.
08
[1]
.
(
AS
base
)
is
the
total
number
shown
at
level
1
without
runes,
masteries,
etc.
It
is
represented
this
way
throughout
the
wiki.
$${\it
AS}_{\rm
base}
=
{1
\over
1.6
*
(1
+
{\it
attack\
speed\
offset})}$$
$${\it
AS}
=
{1
\over
1.6
*
(1
+
{\it
attack\
speed\
offset})}*
\Bigl(1
+
{\it
AS}_{\rm
bonuses}
+
{{\it
AS}_{\rm
per\
lvl}*({\it
level}-1)
\over
100}\Bigr)$$
Bonus
attack
speed
sources
Champions
gain
AS%
at
each
level,
not
including
level
1.
This
amount
ranges
from
roughly
0%
to
4%
and
depends
on
the
champion.
Items
Champion
abilities
The

mastery
The
Frenzy

Attack
Speed
runes
Bonus
AS%
stacks
additively
.
Example:
Stinger
grants
+40%
attack
speed
and
Nashor's
Tooth
grants
+50%
attack
speed,
so
the
champion
gains
+90%
in
total.
Notes:
Final
attack
speed
cannot
go
above
the
cap
of
2.
5
attacks
per
second.
Many
in-game
tooltip
percentages
(such
as
runes)
have
been
rounded,
so
results
may
be
slightly
different
unless
the
precise
numbers
are
known.
Example
Calculating
base
attack
speed:
Twisted
Fate's
attack
delay
is
0.04.
\({1
\over
1.6
*
(1
-
0.04)}
=
{1
\over
1.6
*
0.96}
=
0.651041\overline6\).
This
is
Twisted
Fate's
base
attack
speed,
seen
at
level
1
(without
runes,
masteries,
etc).
The
number
seen
in
game
is
rounded
to
3
decimal
places:
0.651.
Calculating
&quot;bonus
attack
speed&quot;:
Every
time
Twisted
Fate
levels
up,
he
gains
3.
22\
%
as
bonus
AS%.
At
level
18
he
has
gained
\(3.22\%
\times
17
=
54.74\%\)
as
bonus
AS%.
At
18
he
has
maxed
Stacked
Deck
increasing
his
attack
speed
by
30%.
Let's
say
he
has
the
Fury
mastery
up
to
5%.
Let's
also
say
he
has
Phantom
Dancer
:
+50%.
All
together
he
has:
\(54.74\%
+
30\%
+
5\%
+
50\%
=
139.74\%\)
bonus
AS%
or
1.
3974
bonus
AS
as
a
decimal.
Final
calculation:
\(\begin{align}
&amp;
{1
\over
1.6
*
0.96}\times
239.74\%
\\
=&amp;
0.651041\overline6
\times
239.74\%
\\
\approx
&amp;
1.56081
\end{align}\)
In
game,
the
number
will
be
shown
as:
1.561.

Notes
All
percentages
listed
in
a
champion
's
attack
speed
statistic
are
approximations.
Attack
speed
reduction
duration
is
not
affected
by
crowd
control
reduction
.
However
if
attack
speed
reduction
is
in
one
ability
with
crowd
control
like
Nunu's
Ice
Blast
,
then
the
crowd
control
reduction
reduces
its
duration.
So
attack
speed
reduction
is
reduced
by
the
effect
only
along
with
other
crowd
control.
This
has
been
changed
with
Patch
3.13,
as
Attack
Speed
Reductions
are
now
counted
as
Slows.

Scheduling
Ten
champions
are
available
for
free
play
at
any
given
time.
Usually,
each
set
of
champions
is
available
for
one
week,
beginning
on
Tuesday.
However,
there
are
exceptions
to
this;
for
example,
if
Riot
Games
is
releasing
a
major
patch
or
new
content,
they
will
often
schedule
the
new
rotation
of
champions
to
coincide
with
the
patch
release.
[1]
Riot
also
occasionally
shifts
the
rotation
date
to
avoid
rotating
on
US
holidays.
Because
of
this,
week
9
of
Season
1
began
on
Tuesday,
September
7,
rather
than
Monday,
September
6
(which
was
Labor
Day
in
the
US).
This
resulted
in
a
short
week,
as
the
next
week
started
on
schedule
on
Monday,
September
13.
The
European
(EU)
rotation
is
generally
aligned
with
the
United
States
(US)
rotation.
[2]
Next
week's
champion
list
is
usually
released
on
Monday
between
5pm-10pm
PST.
New
champions
New
champions
were
occasionally
placed
into
the
rotation
for
the
week
in
which
they
are
released.
However,
this
was
changed
with
Urgot
,
who
was
released
on
August
24,
2010,
was
not
placed
into
the
free
rotation
until
September
7.
Riot
Games
has
stated
that
their
policy
is
to
&quot;allow
players
to
preview
all
champions
eventually
&quot;
[1]
,
and
it
is
generally
understood
that
new
champions
are
held
out
of
the
free
rotation
temporarily
out
of
respect
for
the
players
who
purchased
them
early.
After
that,
the
new
champions
were
free
to
play
on
the
second
week
after
they
were
released.
Since
the
release
of
Fiora
,
however,
new
champions
have
been
free
to
play
on
the
third
week
following
their
release.
Champion
types
Main
article:
Champion
Rotation
Schedule
(Season

classification
Main
article:
Champion
Rotation
Schedule
(Season
Two)#New
classification
Each
champion
is
listed
in
the
schedule
along
with
a
champion
type
(mage,
tank,
etc.).
However,
many
champions
can
be
played
in
different
ways
depending
on
the
items,
runes,
and
masteries
the
player
chooses.
(For
example,
Alistar
can
be
played
as
a
tank
or
mage).
The
types
listed
in
the
rotation
schedule
are
not
meant
to
dictate
how
the
champion
is
played,
but
to
provide
a
very
quick
and
simple
overview
of
what
kind
of
attributes
the
champion
has,
so
that
players
who
are
new
to
the
character
are
not
overwhelmed.
[1]
Every
champion
is
in
one
of
these
champion
type
&quot;pools&quot;.
There
are
6
champion
type
pools:
Assassin:
14
Fighter:
33
Mage:

Marksman:

Support:

Tank:

Some
champions
are
excluded
from
the
rotation
because
of
balancing
issues,
although
these
have
to
be
severe
enough
to
warrant
a
full
rework
on
the
character.
Currently
Yorick
is
the
only
champion
removed
from
the
rotation.
In
the
past,
Twitch
,
Evelynn
,
and
Karma
were
removed
from
the
rotation
prior
to
their
reworks.
In
the
past,
champions
that
were
removed
from
the
free
rotation
were
also
removed
from
the
sale
rotation,
but
this
is
no
longer
the
case.

  2014 World Championship heads to South Korea By RedBeard  With the preseason about to kick off, we're ready to announce that the 2014 World Championship will be held in South Korea. South Korea is widely considered to be a center of esports and is home to some of the most devoted fans on the planet. With a deep esports heritage, this is an ideal location to follow up the largest esports event to date and showcase the top League of Legends players. At the World Championship, they'll battle it out for the title of world's best. Before we head to South Korea though, we're looking forward to watching the best League of Legends pros from each region face off at the 2014 All-Star game in Europe. Next season will once more showcase the best teams and players in the world so get ready, the 2014 season is on its way!

  &quot;When life gives you lemons, don't make lemonade - make life take the lemons back! Get mad! I don't want your damn lemons, what am I supposed to do with these? Demand to see life's manager. Make life rue the day it thought it could give Cave Johnson lemons. Do you know who I am? I'm the man who's gonna burn your house down! With the lemons. I'm going to to get my engineers to invent a combustible lemon that burns your house down!&quot;-Cave Johnson

  sure its more demanding physically but mentally? Don't get me wrong it takes a lot to come up with those amazing plays and it does require some on the fly thinking but you follow a plan or route every time. League requires way more on the fly reaction and on the fly strategy then football, which makes it, in my opinion, more mentally demanding.

  actually the objectives of league and football are not too different. make it to the otherside. destroying the nexus is the equivelant of getting a touchdown. difference is in league a good play meens the team is smart. in football a goodplay meens the coach is smart and the team is good at doing what they are told

  Football is always going to be better than LoL. The rules are clearer, there's more strategic depth, and nobody has to wait for the NFL to balance corners against wideouts.

  At least you can become a LoL professional player without chronic concussions and suffer debilitating brain damage in your middle-years though.

  I think the brain damage part is debatable if you have to work from anywhere below gold players.

  &quot;Strategic Depth&quot; is a highly volatile term when professional sports are highly dependent on physical conditioning. If you look at the sport as a whole, then the drafting process would certainly add to the strategic depth of a sport. However, if you do choose to look at it this way, then sports seems inherrently flawed in the way that the drafting process determines their team's stength permanantly. Furthermore, sports are also more prone to faulty calls, controversal rulings, and injury related outliers. 
 EDIT: *for the season. We really don't treat players like pawns and it for this reason that oftentimes games can just be power struggles. You don't necessarily have to have better strategies if you can just brute force your way through. A large amount of disparity essentially generates more opportunities for poor play.

  I'd prefer America to start using the metric system like the rest of the world. 
 Sports can come after that.

  I can't believe anyone would even think of posting this. Not only is football a vital part of American heritage, it is an amazing pastime. Yes it has flaws but it has less flaws than any esport out there, especially LoL. As for me I don't care about golf or bowling, but especially not soccer. Who wants to see a game where no one scores a goal all game and at the end just gets a pat on the back for trying hard. Sounds like a waste of sweat and time to me.

          Getting a South Korean visa is easier than getting an American visa.

  This visa requirement is waved for United States citizens. You just need a passport and a plane ticket. (And the money those things cost.)

  None of that has anything to do with Korea. Ching chong and wong are not Korean names, I do not see many eggrolls their and Jackie Chan is Chinese Born in Hong Kong. Why do all dumb NA's think Asia=China=Chinese (im Canadian). But man...Asia includes INdia too but you don't see people talking about that.

  I think this was justified, seeing as the gaming scene there is huge. I'm glad people in other countries will get to experience what we did. Good job, Riot.

  I am kind of sad that it's held in Korea. I understand that the gaming scene is huge over there, but it would have been an amazing opportunity to continue to spread esports in America or even another country as all.

      I'm new to Udyr, and need some help getting the right layout for him. How do you play him, what skills do you max, and what runes/masteries do you acquire?

  I've started putting Udyr into my rotation recently and, after doing some reading and spectating some featured games, I decided to go Tiger&amp;gt;Turtle&amp;gt;Bear and basically forsake Phoenix as long as I'm not forced to put points into it. I figure if you're focusing on Phoenix you'd forsake Tiger just as much. 
 It basically just makes you a blunt instrument that the other team HAS TO deal with and quickly, but almost nobody can 1v1 you.

  Personally I focus Bear first with Pheonix in a close second, do that if you plan to gank often. 
 If you plan to get feral flare and play 'timebomb jungle' max phoenix ASAP and only leave your jungle to countergank and cover. Just helps with the clear time. 
 Get MS or attack speed quints, armor/level seals, mr/level glyphs, and flat armor or attack speed marks.

  Pheonix or tiger really depends on what you're looking for. 
 Tiger will give you better single target damage and better turret pushing while phoenix will give you better clear times and AOE dmg. 
 It's really one or the other, not both.

    Guidelines 
    
    As League of Legends continues to grow and change, we want to maintain a running dialogue on what goes into its evolution. 
 This subcommunity is focused on the live state of League of Legends. This is a den of discussion where we can openly share thoughts, ideas, feedback, analysis, and even criticisms of the live state of League of Legends. 
 Some guidelines to consider: 
 
 This is a place where due diligence is important: doing your homework before discussing live balance changes means that everyone can engage from a well-informed perspective. 
 Blatant misrepresentations of fact to make a point (or to get attention) probably won't get upvotes, but we'll reiterate here that they are also frowned upon. Draw out the real discussion and keep it constructive! 
 Change affecting your most beloved or most hated champion can be polarizing, but try not to let it cloud your voting. If a good point is made, don't downvote it just because you don't want to get nerfed. 
 Context is everything. League of Legends will constantly evolve through the seasons, so try to keep your discussions and suggestions framed in the present day. Remember this is the live game, so taking into account the state of the present is important!

      So I have really started questioning the reliability not of Riots decision making but of the Public Beta Environment and those that have PBE accounts. Are these players that are fortunate to receive access even testing what gets put on the PBE? Are they even capable of giving any sort of decent, reliable, and educated feedback? I am beginning to think they are not. While I feel that the new way people get to gain access to the PBE is a much nicer and far more fair system, I am not so sure it is working out the way they had hoped. 
 I began questioning this, not to scratch at healing wounds, when the Skarner rework hit live. these feelings eventually subsided after I realized that, yes, his rework was in fact viable and that he only needed a little extra love and attention to clean everything up nicely. My concerns returned with this latest patch and the release of Feral Flare to live. This single item now dominates the jungle scene. Any auto-attack/on hit jungle champ are capable of using it and dominating their opponents. I have nearly run the full gambit of champs that benefit from Feral Flare the most, even some that really shouldn't but do, and have cleaned up in nearly every game. I used to main jungle but have recently moved to the top lane because I did not enjoy some of the changes that happened to jungle items at the start of season 4, especially wriggles lantern. When I found out that wriggles was getting a much needed update I started looking forward to trying it out. I was reluctant at first until I started seeing it on my teammates and opponents. Champs that formerly were extremely niche picks began to surface as dominant and superior picks. That is when I decided to take a look at this Feral Flare for myself. At first I was thrilled with it, but quickly after I started trying it on different champs that I wasn't very good with did I notice the problem. This thing is way to fricking powerful. 
 This brings me back to my original question of if the players that have PBE access are really worthy of that privilege. It is hard to believe that Feral Flare made it to live in its current state. How did it not throw red flags across the board that it was still to strong. Are the players on the PBE even thinking about the balance and health of the game? Or are they just giddy to be granted PBE access to the point where they simply say, that's cool, I like it, it is good the way it is. Hopefully it is not that they realize certain changes are unbalanced and simply not say anything so it gets onto live that way. 
 I realize that this might seem like the rantings of someone jealous that does not have access to the PBE. Truth is it would be cool to get that chance, I know I can give strong and reliable feedback, but it doesn't bother me that I do not have access either. What bugs me is that it seems like many of the people that have received PBE accounts do not realize that they are expected to give constructive feedback. Instead, it feels/looks like, they just think of it as some elite player community they get to be a part of. It is one thing to help catch bugs and report them, which is an extremely important part of the PBE, but they also want good educated feedback. I really do not see enough of that when I read the threads, posts, and replies on the PBE forums.

  I got on the PBE but refuse to use it anymore. Almost everyone on there is only there because you get all champions and skins on that account. They couldn't care less about actually Beta Testing and making Riot's patches more of a success. But I am pretty damn sure Riot has they own internal Private Beta Group that helps do what these 'Beta Tester' are supposed to do. At least I hope they do...

  Well I guess I'm in your minority, I try to test as much new content as I can, but I simply can't divide my little free time between that and live to test everything I want to. Mostly I just find bugs, and there are opinions stated that reflect the concerns of the later live playerbase, but when it comes down to it PBE =/= live. The small community, lack of truly competitive play and constant but inevitable bugs make getting a foreseeable trend very difficult for an individual.

  I disagree, if you know enough about the game it is possible to recognize what is healthy and unhealthy for the game. It takes quite a while to gain this knowledge and a great deal of passion for the game, something most players with PBE accounts don't seem to have.

  I agree it isn't impossible but it's unrealistic to expect that out of volunteers. The PBE accomplishes it's job through a shotgun effect of volume use and participants are chosen based on their patterns of exploration. Riot needs people to wander and experience every part of the game in the PBE, but that isn't expected out of every tester. I'll be the first to admit I myself am a little (okay, a lot) passionate about this game, but I'll never be able to test every aspect of the PBE. I actually used feral flare a lot myself in the PBE and didn't run into any &quot;this is OP&quot; moments simply because the games weren't competitive, as everyone was trying out the Rengar rework, Void Fizz and Atlantean Syndra. If the competitive elements are not there as much as live certain situations and hyperbolic cases are simply not commonly encountered. 
 The PBE testers on average can always be better, I completely agree, but I vehemently disagree that most of the PBE testers are not doing their job.

  I didn't say none of them were doing their job. I know for a fact from reading posts that some really are great PBE assets. You are right that to a certain extent PBE is a place to explore and not necessarily be competitive, but that doesn't often make that much of a difference. It is about knowing how much damage can be put out with certain items. When you can read the game in both numbers and experience/feel it is possible to catch the unhealthy elements. 
 I recognize that the level of competitiveness is not high on the PBE but it is still important to think about that while testing. You have to ask a bunch of questions to yourself when you test things. If i offended you by saying most PBE players do not have much passion for the game I am sorry. Most is not all though :P

  oh no, I make it a concerted effort never to be offended on the forums no worries! Apologies if I sounded like I was peeved, was not my intention. =)

  they do have internal testers but the amount they have to test is far greater than what is put on the PBE. They dont have the luxury to really seek out trends which is what the PBE is for. 
 I dont even see what the huge thrill people get by having all skins and champs. I have all the champs, all the runes, and a fair amount of skins... doesn't mean that makes me a better player for having them. Heck once a skin has its bugs worked out id just disable it on the PBE since further testing on it isnt all that necessary. Keep the PBE focused on what needs testing and not on just having a fully unlocked account. Even though the majority lose their account after their testing period is over, at least that way they couldn't get sidetracked on tested content.

    Miscellaneous 
    Guidelines 
    
    During the Community Beta well be making a variety of changes to the platform that will include the creation of many more focused Sub-Communities. For the short term as were continuing to open new Communities this Miscellaneous Sub-Community will act as a catch all for any topics that do not yet have an appropriate place in the Community Beta. Expect to see this Community spun down as the others grow to include all topics associated to League of Legends.

A
rune
is
an
enhancement
that
the
summoner
provides
for
their
champion
before
a
match
on
a
field
of
justice
begins
to
augment
the
champion's
abilities.

from

Each
rune
grants
a
small
bonus
in
a

category,
which
stack
upon
each
other
to
grant
larger
bonuses.
Glyphs,

Types
There
are
four
kinds
of
Runes,
with
three
levels
each,
a
Summoner
can
use:
Mark
:
Offensive.
Seal
:
Defensive.
Glyph
:
Magical.
Quintessence
:
Utility.
It
is
also
important
to
note
that
some
runes
are
&quot;primary&quot;,
while
others
are
called
&quot;secondary&quot;
and
provide
lesser
bonuses.
Given
a
certain
kind
of
rune,
it
will
be
primary
in
either
marks,
glyphs
or
seals,
and
secondary
in
the
other
two
rune
types.
So,
all
kind
of
runes
have
one
primary
type
for
them
and
two
secondary
types.
The
aura
shrouding
a
rune
of
a
certain
effect
will
denote
which
rune
type
it
is
considered
primary
-
for
example,
ability
power
runes
will
have
a
blue
aura
showing
that
it
is
Glyphs
that
specialise
in
them.

Quintessences
have
the
max
possible
effect,
you
may
only
have
three
instead
of
the
nine
marks,
seals,
or
glyphs
-
this
means
one
quintessence
should
be
equal
to
three
or
more
runes
in
order
to
qualify
as
a
&quot;Primary&quot;
Quintessence.
The
following
Quintessences
have
an

equal

or

The

of
a
rune
represents
its

(i.e.
the
extent
of
the
bonuses
it
offers),
and

visible
in
the

of
the

mousing
over
it.

runes
are
dark
and
faded
with
visible
scratches
and
chips
except
for
Quintessences,
which
are
simply
purple.
Tier
2
don't
have
prefixes,
they
are
slightly
brighter
and
are
not
tattered;
Quintessences
now
have
gold
faces
and
purple
backgrounds.
You
can
buy
them
starting
at
level
10.
Tier
3
or
&quot;Greater&quot;
runes
are
brightly
lit;
Quintessences
are
completely
covered
in
gold.
You
can
buy
them
starting
at
level
20.
It
is
important
to
note
that
you
cannot
buy
a
Tier
3
rune
before
you
reach
level
20,
and
that
you
can
acquire
random
ones
for
less
IP
than
buying
them
outright
by
using
the
Rune
Combiner.
Five
&quot;Lesser
Seals
of
Mana
Regeneration&quot;
cost
75
IP
(5

15
IP),
while
one
&quot;Seal
of
Replenishment&quot;
costs
80.
This
equates
to
a
saving
of
5
IP.
Likewise,
a
combined
Tier
3
rune
would
cost
375
IP
(25

15
=
5

75),
cheaper
than
Tier
3
runes
of
costs
from
410
to
2050
IP.
This
equates
to
a
saving
of
35
IP
minimum
and
1675
IP
maximum.
The
cheapest
Tier
3
rune
costs
205.
This
equates
to
a
170
IP
loss.
Keep
in
mind
that
combining
5
runes
of
one
type
will
not
guarantee
you
a
better
(Primary)
rune
of
that
same
type.
The
Rune
Combiner
may
also
give
you
a
Secondary
Rune.
It
is
possible
to
combine
runes
to
higher
tiers
and
use
them
freely
even
if
you
are
too
low
a
level
to
buy
them
directly.
However,
it
is
not
recommended,
as
most
runes
aren't
that
helpful
(e.g.
hybrid
penetration
runes,
which
are
very
specific,
or
secondary
runes),
thus
the
best
long
term
strategy
is
to
start
buying
them
at
level
20
and
saving
up
Influence
Points
before
then.
Usage
Summoners
are
able
to
use
a
rune
per
level
of
power
in
League
of
Legends
,
and
they
keep
their
Runes
in
a
tome
called
a
Runebook
.
Before
a
match
begins,
a
Summoner
will
be
able
to
choose
from
up
to
twenty
different
rune
configurations
they
have
previously
set
in
their
Runebook.
This
allows
the
Summoner
to
have
quick
flexibility
in
choosing
a
Runebook
configuration
best
suited
for
whatever
champion
they
might
use
in
any
of
Valoran's
Fields
of
Justice
.
