Lore
The
wintry
times
of
Snowdown
Showdown
and
the
Lunar
Revel
are
over,
and
all
the
denizens
of
Valoran
are
busy
making
preparations
for
the
spring.
And
what
better
way
to
welcome
the
worlds
wildlife
back
from
their
long
hibernation
than
with
a
massive
hunting
competition!
While
celebrated
by
all
major
city-states,
The
Great
Hunts
origins
lie
in
Bandle
City.
Renowned
for
their
tricks
and
cleverness,
youll
find
no
wilier
hunters
than
the
yordles
on
this
momentous
occasion.
Its
easy
to
see
why!
Yordle
Hunters
Teemo,
the
Swift
Scout
Teemo
always
remembers
to
pack
a
few
poison
mushrooms
and
blinding
darts
before
heading
off
on
a
dire
wolf
hunt.
Good
things
come
to
those
who
lie
in
wait!
Tristana,
the
Megling
Gunner
Tristana
hides
atop
a
tree
and
shoots
her
game
in
a
safe
zone.
Always
keep
a
safe
distance
from
your
targets!
Kennen,
the
Heart
of
the
Tempest
Kennen
runs
back
and
forth
on
the
wolves,
frying
them
with
his
lightning.
Chasing
is
a
breeze
when
you're
as
fast
as
lightning!
Lulu,
the
Fae
Sorceress
Lulu
puts
her
fairy
magic
to
the
test
out
on
the
hunting
grounds.
Even
the
most
dangerous
game
can
be
docile
as
a
squirrel
with
the
proper
application
of
whimsy.
Poppy,
the
Iron
Ambassador
Poppy
is
ready
to
dive
head
on
first
into
the
fray,
focusing
on
one
target
at
a
time
and
ignoring
the
rest.
The
Great
Hunt
is
no
place
for
those
who
can't
handle
the
heat
of
the
competition!
Amumu,
the
Sad
Mummy
Amumu
didn't
exactly
come
here
to
hunt
for
anyone
but
instead
came
here
to
catch
new
pets
to
keep
him
company.
It's
always
nice
to
have
a
new
person
to
your
circle
of
friends!
Veigar,
the
Tiny
Master
of
Evil
Veigar
calls
upon
the
black
arts
to
aid
him
on
his
trapping
expedition.
Its
easier
to
get
the
drop
on
prey
when
you
can
bend
space.
Ziggs,
the
Hexplosives
Expert
Ziggs
puts
his
angling
skills
to
the
test

aided
by
a
little
custom
bait
of
his
own
creation.
Not
all
fishermen
know
that
patience
is
a
virtue!
