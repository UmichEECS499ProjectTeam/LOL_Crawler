Friends

Rivals
Champion
As
a
young
teen,
Lee
Sin
was
intent
on
becoming
a
summoner
.
His
will
and
dedication
were
unmatched
by
any
of
his
peers,
and
his
skill
drew
the
attention
of
Reginald
Ashram,
the
League's
High
Councilor
at
the
time.
While
studying
at
the
Arcanum
Majoris,
Lee
Sin
became
frustrated
with
instruction
paced
for
the
other
students.
He
spent
his
free
time
researching
the
nuances
of
summoning
in
hopes
of
graduating
sooner.
He
made
amazing
advances
in
his
arcane
studies,
surpassing
all
other
students.
By
all
indications,
he
would
have
become
one
of
the
League's
greatest
summoners
were
it
not
for
one
terrible
mistake.
Too
impatient,
he
attempted
to
test
his
ability
by
summoning
a
beast
from
the
Plague
Jungles.
What
he
summoned
instead
was
a
young
boy,
but
not
in
one
piece.
He
barely
had
time
to
look
the
boy
in
what
was
once
his
face
before
the
jumbled
human
mass
fell
lifeless
to
the
floor.
A
League
investigation
later
revealed
that
the
boy's
entire
village
was
obliterated
by
feedback
from
the
ritual.
Lee
Sin's
talents
were
so
promising
that
the
League
was
willing
to
overlook
the
incident,
but
he
could
never
forgive
himself.
He
left
the
Institute
and
journeyed
to
the
Shojin
Monastery
for
eternal
repentance,
swearing
never
to
practice
magic
again.
Years
later,
hoping
to
atone
for
his
crime
with
martyrdom,
he
set
himself
ablaze
as
a
protest
of
the
Noxian
occupation
of
Ionia
.
He
remained
alive
in
this
state,
enduring
searing
agony
for
weeks.
His
actions
paved
the
way
for
a
League
match
wherein
Ionia
prevailed,
but
by
the
time
he
was
doused,
his
eyes
had
been
burned
completely
from
their
sockets.
Hailed
as
a
savior,
he
was
reborn,
and
his
will
to
act
invigorated.
He
joined
the
League
of
Legends
to
continue
his
atonement
with
sweat
and
blood,
a
true
monk's
only
possessions.
&quot;The
actions
of
one
may
sunder
the
world,
but
the
efforts
of
many
may
rebuild
it.&quot;

Lee
Sin
Protest
of
the
Shojin
Monk
Main
article:
Ionia
The
events
leading
up
to
the
Ionia
vs
Noxus
rematch
started
when
Lee
Sin,
a
monk
from
the
Shojin
Monastery,
set
himself
aflame
within
the
Ionian
Lotus
Garden.
He
would
not
allow
anyone
to
put
out
the
fire
until
the
three
regions
of
Southern
Ionia
were
freed
from
Noxus'
occupation.
[1]
Lee
Sin
remained
in
this
state
of
excruciating
pain
for
over
two
months.
After
Ionia
won
their
rematch
against
Noxus,
he
was
greeted
by
his
sister
from
the
now
liberated
Southern
provinces.
Only
then
did
Lee
Sin
allow
the
flames
to
be
extinguished.
Though
his
brethren
swiftly
brought
the
monk
back
to
the
monastery
for
treatment,
he
had
already
suffered
the
loss
of
his
eyes
due
to
the
intense
heat.

CLE
OBSERVATION
Lee
Sin
crosses
the
Great
Hall
with
an
aura
of
confidence
unusual
for
a
blind
man.
He
seems
to
gather
sensory
information
so
efficiently
it
makes
one
wonder
whether,
for
him,
blindness
is
a
weakness
or
a
strength.
His
physique
is
exceedingly
understated,
tuned
only
for
practical
use
by
years
of
martial
study.
What
he
lacks
in
size,
he
makes
up
for
with
presence.
His
conviction
is
absolute.
He
pads
straight
to
the
doors,
then
stomps
the
ground.
His
head
moves
up
the
door,
tracking
the
resulting
sound.
He
chuckles
at
the
inscription.
REFLECTION
A
damp
echo
trickled
outward
as
the
doors
thud
shut
behind
Lee
Sin,
painting
the
rooms
cramped
dimensions
in
his
mind.
The
sound
was
low
and
the
air
was
stuffy,
distorting
the
noise
and
accenting
his
mental
image
with
a
subtle
blur.
In
the
crannies
of
the
musty
stone,
fading
but
distinct
human
scents
lingered,
the
trace
pheromones
of
violent
emotion.
But
Lee
Sin
was
transfixed
on
the
overwhelming
stench
of
ready
magic.
Arcane
potential
loomed
in
the
air
around
him,
more
than
he
had
ever
sensed
before.
The
Reflecting
Chamber
swelled
with
it.
To
most,
it
would
be
imperceptible,
likely
misinterpreted
as
jitters
or
dread.
It
had
the
quality
of
the
calm
before
the
storm:
a
pregnant
stillness,
a
swindling
serenity.
Lee
Sin
knew
that
this
room,
in
its
current
state,
was
an
amplifier,
an
accelerant
for
sorcery.
He
could
taste
the
magical
anticipation,
like
a
static
charge
waiting
to
be
released.
The
aroma
of
fresh
pine
was
suddenly
everywhere.
He
stepped
back.
And
fire
engulfed
him.
The
sensation
was
familiar
more
than
anything
else.
Before
the
frantic
damage
reports
arrived
from
nerves
all
over
his
body,
he
shut
down
part
of
his
mind.
He
refused
the
pain
access.
Now
there
was
only
intensity
and
focus.
Here
he
was
again,
amidst
the
flames.
In
a
disturbing
way,
it
felt
like
home.
Five
months
had
passed
since
he
began
the
protest
of
the
Noxian
occupation
in
Ionia.
He
lit,
without
any
pretense
of
survival,
the
pyre
that
consumed
his
flesh
for
two
months.
In
that
time,
with
agony
tugging
at
his
sanity,
Lee
Sin
discovered
things
which
hid
deep
within
the
soul,
inner
truths
that
revealed
themselves
only
in
the
face
of
certain
annihilation.
Just
before
the
lapping
flames
were
to
claim
his
final
breath,
his
fellow
monks
arrived
with
the
news
that
Ionia
was
free.
It
was
a
cleansing
fire,
wasnt
it?
He
recognized
the
bold
timbre
of
his
former
mentor,
Reginald
Ashram,
as
acutely
as
the
blaze
surging
around
him.
Ashram
was
one
of
the
few
people
in
Valoran
privy
to
the
secrets
of
Lee
Sins
past.
Pain
does
not
heal
the
heart,
it
only
focuses
the
mind.
In
this
case,
it
focused
many
minds,
and
led
to
Noxus
withdrawal
from
Ionian
territory.
A
happy
turn
of
events.
Lee
Sin
smiled,
although
the
flickering
heat
on
his
face
made
him
wonder
if
Ashram
could
see
it.
But
you
still
havent
forgiven
yourself.
Lee
Sin
sank
to
a
meditative
pose
and
the
fire
billowed
in
return.
This,
ironically,
was
his
sanctuary.
The
past
remains,
no
act
will
undo
it.
His
tongue
knew
these
words
like
the
grooves
of
his
teeth.
Why
do
you
want
to
join
the
League,
Lee
Sin?
I
have
much
yet
to
do.
Explain.
Remaining
seated,
Lee
Sin
raised
one
hand
to
his
chest,
fire
dancing
upon
it.
He
swept
it
forward
so
sharply
that
the
pyre
flickered,
and
the
flames
on
his
arm
were
completely
extinguished.
A
decisive
strike
may
finish
a
battle,
He
paused
as
flames
crept
back
up
his
outstretched
arm,
but
the
evils
of
this
world
persist.
To
combat
them,
we
must
remain
diligent.
The
fire
reached
his
hand
again,
and
he
closed
it
with
such
force
that
a
shock
wave
rippled
out,
expunging
the
blaze
that
consumed
him.
The
wave
whipped
across
Ashram,
and
he
took
a
half-step
back.
How
did
you
survive
that
fire?
I
found
the
purpose
I
had
lost
so
long
ago.
And
what
is
that
purpose?
What
is
your
ultimate
goal?
There
was
an
urgency
in
Ashrams
voice,
a
hint
of
concern
that
puzzled
Lee
Sin.
Ashram
felt
threatened.
One
does
not
need
a
destination
to
have
direction.
Is
a
drop
of
water
finished
when
it
flows
from
the
brook
to
the
ocean?
Is
it
complete
when
it
rises
to
join
the
clouds?
Has
it
failed
when
it
falls
upon
the
land?
An
obliging
drop
of
sweat
rolled
down
his
forehead.
What
is
your
direction?
To
do
what
is
right.
To
protect
the
overlooked
things
which
matter
most.
The
drop
of
sweat
hovered
on
the
edge
of
his
brow.
You
can
find
them
in
the
bubbling
of
the
brook,
the
shade
of
the
passing
cloud,
or
the
coolness
of
the
rain.
On
cue,
the
drop
fell
to
his
waiting
palm.
Ashram
phrased
his
response
carefully.
Your
protest
moved
all
of
Valoran
to
action.
Nearly
to
military
action.
This
is
a
tremendous
amount
of
power
for
one
man
to
wield.
What
happens
if
that
one
mans
intentions
become
corrupt?
Then
I
hope
other
men
find
the
good
in
themselves
to
do
what
is
right.
The
inquisitor
reeked
of
frustration.
He
was
unused
to
vulnerability,
uncomfortable
with
all
that
Lee
Sin
could
perceive.
How
does
it
feel
to
expose
your
mind?
The
question
was
bitter
and
hollow,
deprived
of
its
usual
gravitas.
I
would
ask
you
the
same
question.
Silence
ensued.
Lee
Sin
knew
he
was
alone.
The
magical
potency
was
gone,
spent,
and
in
its
place
sat
an
atmosphere
of
somber
fatigue.
This
was
the
emotional
residue
of
those
who
had
completed
the
trial
before
him.
Its
flavor
was
bittersweet.
In
one
graceful,
fluid
motion,
Lee
Sin
was
on
his
feet.
His
clothes
and
skin
were
intact,
as
though
untouched
by
the
flames.
A
fresh
breeze
swept
through
the
room.
Lee
Sin
could
sense
the
shape
of
its
current
as
it
moved,
like
a
serpent
returning
to
coil
in
its
nest.
Lee
Sin
lingered
a
moment,
head
bowed
in
appreciation
of
the
champions
who
had
passed
this
threshold
before
him.
One
life
past,
one
life
ahead.
So
the
Blind
Monk
joined
the
League
of
Legends.

revealed
Blind
Monk's
true
name:
Lee
Sin
[4]
Blind
Monk's
model
was
used
in
WCG
for
the
spectator.
His
height
is
similar
to
that
of
Jax
,
basing
upon
his
concept
art.
It
was
said
that
he
was
remade
into
Udyr
The
Animal
Spirit
.
However,
Riot
Game
Designer
Guinsoo
hinted
that
this
was
not
the
case.
[3]
Hohums
later
confirmed
Guinsoo's
words.
[5]
It
has
been
strongly
implied
that
he
was
the
burning
monk
during
the
Ionia/Noxus
feud,
in
Issue
12
of
the
JoJ
,
stating
&quot;His
brethren
hastened
the
monks
blistered
body
swiftly
back
to
the
monastery
for
treatment.
While
it
was
clear
that
he
would
survive,
the
monk
had
suffered
the
loss
of
his
eyes
,
along
with
other
severe
injuries
from
the
intense
heat.&quot;
These
would
seem
to
corroborate
the
&quot;Mystic
Meditation&quot;
icon,
as
well
as
the
fact
that
flickers
of
flame
can
be
seen
in
its
portrait.
This
was
later
confirmed
in
his
League
Judgment,
and
Champion
Background.

Lee

is

monk
who

himself
as
an
act
of
protest
against
the
persecution
of
Buddhist
monks
during
the
Buddhist
crisis
in
South
Vietnam.
Ezreal
stated
that
the
blind
monk
has
been
deconfirmed
[1]
.
In
Maokai's
Art

towards
the
end
a
tab
is
shown
titled
&quot;blindmonk.psd&quot;,
which
could
mean
that
artwork
is
being
done
for
Lee
Sin,
that
the
Rioters
are
trying
to
tease
the
Blind-Monk
fanboys,
or
that
the
artist
in
question
just
likes
working
on
Blind
Monk
for
fun.
Also,
in

&quot;Brolaf,
the
King
of
Bromacia&quot;
the
name
&quot;Blind
Monk&quot;
can
be
seen
on

.
This
however
was
most
likely
done
as
a
joke
by
the
staff
as
in

there
are

Champion
Sneak

Announcement

:
Lee
Sin
Promo
Last
year,
around
this
time,
we
were
forced
to
say
our
goodbyes
to
a
loved
and
cherished
friend,
taken
from
us
so
tragically
and
so
senselessly
before
his
time.
On
April
1st
2010,
we
bid
farewell
to
Urf
the
Manatee.
It
was
a
trying
time
for
all
of
us
all,
and
many
came
forward
to
pour
their
hearts
out
and
memorialize
this
noble
prince
among
Sea
Cows.
If
theres
anything
that
the
death
of
Urf
the
Manatee
has
taught
us,
its
that
people
deal
with
grief
in
different
ways.
For
instance,
take
this
gentleman
here.
Lee
Sin
was
so
shaken
up
that
he
actually
ran
off
and
joined
a
monastery.
Now
hes
Lee
Sin
the
Blind
Monk.
Hey,
what
do
you
mean
youve
seen
him
before?
On

featuring

was

Trivia
Lee
Sin
was
designed
by
Coronach
.
Lee
Sin's
name
is
a
homophone
of
the
word
&quot;listen.&quot;
A
rough
translation
of
his
name
in
Spanish
is
&quot;no
reading&quot;.
His
name
written
in
Chinese/Japanese
is
,
which
literally
means
&quot;Plum
Azure/Blue/Green&quot;.
[1]
In
Japanese
is
it
pronounced
as
&quot;Ri
Sei&quot;
(Ree-say).
His
self-immolation
from
the
lore
is
a
reference
to
the
real
life
monk
who
publicly
set
himself
on
fire.
He
did
this
as
an
act
of
protest
against
the
persecution
of
Buddhism
in
South
Vietnam.
Lee
Sin
is
the
first
champion
to
feature
two
champion
spotlights,
a
real
one
and
a
fake
one
for
April
Fool's.
Lee
Sin
is
the
first
champion
to
use
energy
that
is
not
a
ninja
.
Though,
similar
to
the
other
ninjas
,
he
is
a
champion
that
hails
from
Ionia
.
Lee
Sin
shares
a
quote
with
Soraka
,
&quot;Where
am
I
needed?&quot;
Lee
Sin
is
one
of
five
champions
to
have
more
than
4
skills,
the
other
being
Nidalee
,
Jayce
,
Elise
and
Karma
.
Lee
Sin
was
the
second
champion
to
have
more
than
4
skills.
Lee
Sin
is
the
first
monk
type
champion
announced
but
the
second
to
be
released
after
Udyr
.
Lee
Sin
is
the
only
allegedly
cancelled
Champion
to
be
introduced
to
the
game
under
his
original
name.
Lee
Sin
was
a
cancelled
Champion
that
got
brought
back
by
community
popularity
and
support.
Lee
Sin's
dance
style
is
referenced
to
one
of
'Mighty
Steel
Legs'
moves
in
the
movie
Shaolin
Soccer.
A
side-by-side
comparison
can
be
seen
here
.
Lee
Sin
is
the
first
champion
to
be
re-designed
and
to
be
given
a
re-launch
skin
in
technicality
as
his
classic
skin
was
originally
the
Traditional
Lee
Sin
skin,
however
the
change
occured
before
his
release.
Skins
For
April
Fool's,
the
original
Classic
skin
artwork
used
to
have
the
deceased
champion
Urf,
the
Manatee
,
who
could
be
seen
at
the
bottom
left
of
the
artwork.
Traditional
Lee
Sin
resembles
how
he
looked
before
his
official
release
(seen
in
the
second
official
trailer).
Click
here
.
He
can
be
seen
at
around
0:11,
between
Jax
and
Teemo
.
Acolyte
Lee
Sin
was
meant
to
show
his
appearance
during
his
time
as
a
summoner
in
training.
Dragon
Fist
Lee
Sin
(Lunar
Revel
2012
event
release)
skin
is
a
tribute
to
Bruce
Lee,
the
famed
martial
artist/actor
of
1970's
action
movies.
The
skin
seems
to
be
specifically
referencing
his
trademark
look
first
seen
in
Enter
the
Dragon.
Dragon
Fist
Lee
Sin's
idle
animation
are
Bruce
Lee's
mannerisms
when
he
is
serious.
Lee
Sin
in
the
Chinese
servers
happens
to
also
have
the
same
character
written
for
his
last
name
()
as
Bruce
Lee's,
which
literally
means
&quot;plum&quot;,
and
with
it
being
a
common
Chinese
surname.
Muay
Thai
Lee
Sin
was
created
to
celebrate
the
launch
of
League
of
Legends
in
Thailand
and
pays
homage
to
Muay
Thai
,
a
combat
sport
native
to
the
country.
Muay
Thai
Lee
Sin
is
the
third
non-legendary
skin
to
have
a
different
dance
animation
from
the
original
skin,
prior
being
Jurrasic
Cho'Gath
and
Dynasty
Ahri
.
His
dance
is
referenced
from
the
movie
&quot;Ong
Bak&quot;.
A
side-by-side
comparison
can
be
seen
here
.
Muay
Thai
Lee
Sin
is
very
similar
to
Sagat's
outfit
from
the
fighting
game
series
Street
Fighter
.
In
the
Poolparty
Lee
Sin
splash
art,
you
can
see
Orianna
in
the
back
and
Lee
Sin
talking
to
Nidalee
.
You
can
also
see
a
Ward
Necklace
on
the
left
pole.
Relations
Lee
Sin
was
once
a
summoner-in-training
at
the
League
,
before

Trivia
Skill
usage
As
it
is
with
most
champions
,
the
key
to
becoming
a
skilled
Lee
Sin
player
is
to
adapt
your
strategy
to
maximize
his
passive
ability
.
Lee
Sin
can
burst
by
using
his
abilities
and
their
secondary
activations
in
rapid
succession
but
that
quickly
depletes
his
energy
.
Lee
Sin's
Flurry
adds
40%
attack
speed
to
the
two
basic
attacks
that
immediately
follow,
each
of
which
also
refund
15
energy
.
In
order
to
maximize
this
buff
's
effects,
stagger
(space
out)
your
abilities
with
autoattacks
in
between.
Sonic
Wave
/
Resonating
Strike
is
a
great
way
to
close
in
on
your
opponents.
You
can
use
Sonic
Wave
at
range
and
then
close
the
distance
with
Resonating
Strike
,
initiating
melee
combat.
Or,
if
you
are
already
in
melee
combat,
you
can
use
Sonic
Wave
as
you
fake
a
retreat,
hit
Resonating
Strike
,
and
re-enter
the
battle.
You
can
use
Sonic
Wave
/
Resonating
Strike
when
you
are
slowed,
go
through
some
walls,
and
chase
enemies
through
a
slowing
AoE
e.g.
Trundle's
Pillar
of
Ice
.
Be
careful
when
immediately
using
Resonating
Strike
after
Sonic
Wave
.
You
may
end
up
charging
right
into
a
turret
,
an
enemy
champion
in
the
brush
,
or
even
outnumbered
and
alone
if
you're
not
careful.
The
combo
of
Sonic
Wave
and
Resonating
Strike
plus
Safeguard
is
very
useful
for
hit-and-run
exchanges.
One
of
the
most
effective
methods
of
harassing
with
Lee
Sin
is
to
use
Resonating
Strike
to
attack
an
enemy
and
then
immediately
retreat
with
Safeguard
.
This
can
be
a
powerful
move
early
on
in
the
laning
phase.
You
can
begin
using
this
combo
as
early
as
Level
2
and
often
the
opposing
champion
(s)
have
limited
means
of
retaliation.
On
the
top
lane,
if
you
face
a
Champion
who
mainly
use
AOE
spells
to
harass
(e.g
Darius
and
his
Decimate
or
Renekton
and
his
Cull
the
Meek
),
You
can
force
him
to
push
the
minion
wave
without
getting
hit
by
using
the
method
mentioned
above
and
then
make
an
easy
gank
with
your
jungler.
Sonic
Wave
/
Resonating
Strike
and
Safeguard
is
also
effective
for
tower
diving
.
Smartcasting
Safeguard
might
be
just
enough
to
give
you
the
edge
you
need,
when
using
this
strategy,
to
dash
in
and
out
with
a
kill.
Safeguard
has
a
primary
defensive
use
but
it
can
be
effective
in
an
offensive
context
as
well.
If
an
enemy
champion
is
out
of
range
of
Sonic
Wave
,
but
is
in
melee
range
of
an
allied
minion
or
champion,
use
Safeguard
to
jump
right
in.
Safeguard
is
essential
to
have
&quot;leveled
up&quot;
when
you're
facing
off
against
a
bruiser
.
Safeguard
cannot
be
cast
while
snared,
even
if
Lee
Sin
targets
himself,
as
it
classified
as
a
dash/movement
ability.
If
you
are
engaging
an
enemy
that
has
a
snare
try
to
dodge
it
with
Sonic
Wave
/
Resonating
Strike
or
Safeguard
.
Alternatively
self
cast
the
Safeguard
preemptively
to
negate
(most
of)
the
snare's
damage.
Tempest
is
great
for
clearing
minion
waves
and
Lee
Sin
can
afford
to
spam
it.
Tempest
and
Sonic
Wave
is
a
great
combo
for
fighting
champions
with
stealth
or
those
trying
to
juke
or
hide
in
brush
.
Combining
both
skill
can
keep
an
enemy
revealed
for
up
to
7
seconds
and
at
higher
ranks
or
with
CDR
it's
enough
to
have
the
combo
ready
again.
If
Resonating
Strike
is
used,
the
target
will
no
longer
be
revealed.
However
using
Cripple
doesn't
stop
the
reveal
from
Tempest
.
Cripple
offers
great
utility.
Its
attack
speed
slow
is
useful
when
engaging
AD
enemies
with
Lee
Sin
and
the
movement
speed
slow
when
Lee
Sin
or
the
enemy
wishes
to
retreat.
Using
Dragon's
Rage
can
disrupt
the
enemy
team's
positioning
at
the
beginning
of
a
teamfight
.
Not
only
will
Dragon's
Rage
knock
an
enemy
back
(preferably
the
tank
or
bruiser
),
but
it
will
also
knock
up
the
champions
hiding
behind
him.
Dragon's
Rage
can
also
be
used
to
interrupt
a
channeling
ability
if
your
team
has
their
interrupts
on
cooldown.
During
a
team
engagement,
try
to
use
Dragon's
Rage
on
a
carry
who
overextends
to
isolate
them
from
their
team
and
pick
up
an
easy
kill.
You
can
also
use
Resonating
Strike
to
get
behind
the
carry
and
Dragon's
Rage
them
to
your
team,
temporarily
disabling
any
enemies
that
get
hit
by
their
own
carry.
Follow
it
up
with
a
Safeguard
to
get
back
to
your
team.
An
effective
method
of
picking
of
anyone
from
the
enemy
team
is
to
use
Sonic
Wave
on
the
target
champion,
followed
by
Safeguard
to
get
close,
followed
by
Tempest
and
Cripple
,
then
Dragon's
Rage
and
Resonating
Strike
into
your
team,
or
at
least
away
from
the
enemy.
This
applies
all
the
buffs
available
to
lee
sin,
as
well
as
quickly
bursting
down
the
select
champion,
getting
yourself
out
of
the
team
fight,
and
slowing
any
surrounding
enemies
from
following
you
afterwards
as
you
make
your
escape.
The
only
downfall
would
be
Lee
Sin
's
rapid
energy
depletion
during
this
combo,
though
if
well
timed
with
auto
attacks
can
be
very
effective
at
regenerating
Lee
Sin
's
energy,
as
well
as
picking
off
enemies
and
initiating.
It
is
not
advised
to
use
Dragon's
Rage
as
a
finisher,
as
one
incorrect
calculation
may
lead
to
the
target
escaping
instead.
You
have
to
make
sure
to
aim
Dragon's
Rage
correctly
as
this
can
prove
to
be
crucial
mistake
in
team
fights.
For
example:
kicking
an
enemy
champion
out
of
range
of
a
friendly
Amumu's
Curse
of
the
Sad
Mummy
.
A
cool
move
often
made
is
to
Sonic
Wave
+
Dragon's
Rage
and
then
Resonating
Strike
so
you
kick
the
champion
while
Sonic
Wave
's
mark
is
on
them
so
you
can
catch
up
with
Resonating
Strike
.
This
move
maximizes
your
damage-output,
since
Resonating
Strike
deals
damage
based
on
%
missing
health.
Lee
Sin
is
deceptively
resilient
in
fights,
and
as
such,
retreat
isn't
always
the
best
option
when
you're
losing.
Resonating
Strike
Does
significantly
more
damage
to
champions
with
lower
health,
which
is
usually
the
case
after
a
drawn
out
fight.
Using
Lee
Sin's
Sonic
Wave
followed
by
Dragon's
Rage
can
put
them
out
of
range
for
their
finisher,
allowing
you
to
easily
use
Lee
Sin's
Resonating
Strike
as
a
finisher.
Don't
forget
that
Iron
Will
heals
the
damage
you
do
with
your
abilities
including
Dragon's
Rage
healing
you
for
a
good
amount
of
health
when
cast
with
Iron
Will
active.
If
you
are
being
chased
by
2
or
more
foes,
wait
for
them
to
line
up
and
use
Dragon's
Rage
to
knock
up
the
chasers
Build
usage
As
all
of
Lee
Sin's
damaging
abilities
scale
only
on
bonus
attack
damage
,
attack
damage
items
are
crucial
to
his
build.
Depending
on
which
way
you
want
to
look
at
it,
either
Lee
Sin
's
damage
output
will
fall
off
as
the
game
progresses
without
attack
damage
items
or
Lee
Sin
scaling
well
into
late
game
with
attack
damage
items.
The
Bloodthirster
,
The
Black
Cleaver
,
or
Maw
of
Malmortius
are
good
choices
but
only
if
doing
well
or
pretty
late
in
the
game.
Getting
The
Bloodthirster
on
Lee
Sin
will
have
profound
effects
with
his
damage
output
and
regeneration.
Lee
Sin
requires
a
fair
amount
of
survivability
due
to
how
close
he
must
get
to
enemies
while
he
fights
and
the
time
it
takes
for
him
to
utilize
his
passive
,
getting
items
like
Wriggle's
Lantern
and
Hexdrinker
early
can
have
noticeable
results.
Building
Lee
Sin
tanky
is
important
because
to
use
his
ult
properly
he
needs
to
be
able
to
survive
being
in
the
middle
of
the
fight.
If
played
in
lane,
Atma's
Impaler
will
be
more
beneficial
than
Wriggle's
Lantern
,
especially
if
building
more
towards
the
tanky
side
of
tanky
DPS.
Randuin's
Omen
is
a
viable
item
for
Lee
Sin
,
complementing
his
ability
to
slow
movement
speed
and
attack
speed
.
Buying
an
Atma's
Impaler
is
generally
great
idea
for
a
Lee
Sin
building
health
and
consider
complementing
it
with
a
Frozen
Mallet
and/or
Warmog's
Armor
.
Getting
tanky
with
a
Frozen
Mallet
or
Warmog's
Armor
will
allow
you
survive
longer
and
eventually
give
you
more
attack
damage
if
you
get
Atma's
Impaler
and
increasing
maximum
health
.
Trinity
Force
is
a
good,
all-round
item
for
Lee
Sin
,
even
though
Lee
Sin
is
manaless
and
this
item
grants
mana
.
Since
he
has
7
skills,
he
can
constantly
proc
the
effects
of
Sheen
and
make
use
of
his
good
base
attack
damage
.
Coupled
with
his
passive
,
he
is
very
likely
to
proc
the
Phage
effect
giving
him
excellent
DPS
and
chasing.
Trinity
Force
will
also
provide
some
ability
power
to
slightly
improve
the
shield
from
Safeguard
without
sacrificing
an
item
spot
purely
on
AP,
in
addition
to
its
plethora
of
beneficial
effects
and
stats.
However,
given
his
strong
attack
damage
scaling
and
natural
squishiness,
it
is
best
to
get
Trinity
Force
late,
instead
going
for
attack
damage
/durability
items
such
as
Wriggle's
Lantern
,
Hexdrinker
,
Phage
,
or
a
few
Doran's
Blades
.
Lee
Sin
can
drop
a
tower
fast
if
he
has
Trinity
Force
because
his
low
CD
abilities
do
not
require
targets
to
cast,
allowing
him
proc
the
bonus
damage
every
2
seconds.
With
Youmuu's
Ghostblade
a
midgame
Lee
Sin
can
singlehandedly
push
a
turret.
When
playing
jungle
Lee
Sin
,
you
can
use
Wriggle's
Lantern
to
place
free
wards
for
not
only
vision
and
map
control,
but
also
for
synergy
with
Safeguard
.
This
allows
you
to
hop
over
walls
to
gank/escape
enemies.
Attack
speed
items
are
a
non-optimal
build
path
on
Lee
Sin
.
His
innate
Flurry
grants
him
natural
attack
speed
and
most
of
his
damage,
like
an
AD
caster
,
comes
from
attack
damage
scaling
abilities.
Jungling
Lee
Sin
is
one
of
the
best
junglers
having
both
great
clearing
speed
and
sustain
.
In
addition
to
the
above,
being
a
good
duelist
makes
him
a
great
counter
jungler
too.
Remember
to
use
Iron
Will
before
using
Smite
and/or
Sonic
Wave
,
as
it
restores
health
through
spell
vamp
.

Most
of
his
spells
deal
physical
damage
.
Investing
in
armor
items
will
mitigate
his
damage
output.
However
Tempest
does
magic
damage
with
1.0
AD
ratio.
Resonating
Strike
will
deal
a
lot
of
damage
when
you
are
low
on
health.
Try
to
dodge
his
Sonic
Wave
so
he
can't
use
Resonating
Strike
to
finish
you
off.
Cripple
will
only
slow
you
if
he
hits
you
with
Tempest
.
Make
sure
you
stay
away
from
the
ability's
AoE
in
order
to
avoid
the
slow.
Beware
when
committing
to
kill
Lee
Sin
.
With
wards
in
his
inventory
to
place
and
cast
Safeguard
on,
jungle
monsters
or
enemy
minions
to
hit
with
Sonic
Wave
and
Resonating
Strike
to,
and
having
Dragon's
Rage
available
to
knockback
enemies
a
large
distance
or
knock
them
up
into
the
air,
Lee
Sin
has
an
enormous
amount
of
potential
to
escape
and
evade
dogged
enemies,
causing
said
enemies
to
waste
a
large
amount
of
time
chasing
him
at
best.
Instead
of
battling
him
in
minion
wave,
try
to
fight
him
when
he
is
alone
so
he
can't
make
the
full
use
of
the
dash
from
his
Safeguard
.
Keep
in
mind
that
he
can
still
cast
Safeguard
on
himself
to
gain
its
shield,
plus
the
life
steal
and
spell
vamp
from
Iron
Will
.
Snares
also
stop
Safeguard
from
being
cast
at
all
within
their
duration.
When
playing
as
a
stealth
champion,
wait
until
Lee
Sin
uses
Sonic
Wave
and
Tempest
so
you
won't
get
revealed.
Lee
Sin's
Dragon's
Rage
will
knock
you
back
to
a
set
distance.
If
he
targets
you,
it's
better
to
run
away
in
the
direction
he
kicked
you
rather
than
running
through
Lee
Sin
to
escape.
Be
extremely
careful
not
to
use
Flash
to
escape
while
affected
by
Sonic
Wave
.
Lee
Sin
can
activate
Resonating
Strike
to
jump
to
you
from
a
long
distance
away,
as
its
range
is
1100.
Save
Flash
until
Sonic
Wave
wears
off
or
Lee
Sin
has
already
used
Resonating
Strike
.
Keep
in
mind
that
Lee
Sin
's
abilities
have
high
energy
costs
when
engaging
him.
He
will
be
vulnerable
and
unable
to
take
much
action
if
he
is
energy-starved.
Keep
your
team
spread
to
minimize
the
effect
of
his
Dragon's
Rage
.
Lee
Sin's
biggest
counter
is
time
since
his
damage
falls
off
greatly
late
game.
Play
carefully
early
game!
This
only
applies
if
Lee
Sin
does
not
affect
the
allied
carry's
late
game
and
does
not
build
AD
tank
items,
such
as
Atma's
Impaler
,
Frozen
Mallet
or
Maw
of
Malmortius
.
One
of
Lee
Sin
's
biggest
early
game
strengths
in
the
jungle
is
his
large
amount
of
sustain
using
Energy
and
his
dueling
ability
to
win
1v1
trades
every
champion
against
some
of
the
best
duelists
(early
game
Jax
,
Vi
,
Fiora
,
and
Xin
Zhao
),
most
assassins
(
Zed
,
Fizz
,
Akali
,
and
Talon
),
even
some
of
the
tankiest
junglers
(
Amumu
,
Rammus
,
and
Volibear
).
Please
keep
in
note
of
that
when
Lee
Sin
is
counter
jungling.

     Lee Sin performs a powerful roundhouse kick launching his target back, dealing physical damage to the target and any enemies they collide with. Enemies the target collides with are knocked into the air for a short duration. This technique was taught to him by Jesse Perring, although Lee Sin does not kick players off the map.
      
            
       Lee Sin performs a powerful roundhouse kick launching an enemy champion back, dealing 200/400/600 (+200% bonus Attack Damage) physical damage to the target and any enemies they collide with. Enemies the target collides with are knocked into the air for a short duration.

       As a young teen, Lee Sin was intent on becoming a summoner. His will and dedication were unmatched by any of his peers, and his skill drew the attention of Reginald Ashram, the League's High Councilor at the time. While studying at the Arcanum Majoris, Lee Sin became frustrated with instruction paced for the other students. He spent his free time researching the nuances of summoning in hopes of graduating sooner. He made amazing advances in his arcane studies, surpassing all other students. By all indications, he would have become one of the League's greatest summoners were it not for one terrible mistake. Too impatient, he attempted to test his ability by summoning a beast from the Plague Jungles. What he summoned instead was a young boy, but not in one piece. He barely had time to look the boy in what was once his face before the jumbled human mass fell lifeless to the floor. A League investigation later revealed that the boy's entire village was obliterated by feedback from the ritual. Lee Sin's talents were so promising that the League was willing to overlook the incident, but he could never forgive himself. He left the Institute and journeyed to the Shojin Monastery for eternal repentance, swearing never to practice magic again. Years later, hoping to atone for his crime with martyrdom, he set himself ablaze as a protest of the Noxian occupation of Ionia. He remained alive in this state, enduring searing agony for weeks. His actions paved the way for a League match wherein Ionia prevailed, but by the time he was doused, his eyes had been burned completely from their sockets. Hailed as a savior, he was reborn, and his will to act invigorated. He joined the League of Legends to continue his atonement with sweat and blood, a true monk's only possessions. ''The actions of one may sunder the world, but the efforts of many may rebuild it.'' - Lee Sin

Champion
As
a
young
teen,
Lee
Sin
was
intent
on
becoming
a
summoner
.
His
will
and
dedication
were
unmatched
by
any
of
his
peers,
and
his
skill
drew
the
attention
of
Reginald
Ashram,
the
League's
High
Councilor
at
the
time.
While
studying
at
the
Arcanum
Majoris,
Lee
Sin
became
frustrated
with
instruction
paced
for
the
other
students.
He
spent
his
free
time
researching
the
nuances
of
summoning
in
hopes
of
graduating
sooner.
He
made
amazing
advances
in
his
arcane
studies,
surpassing
all
other
students.
By
all
indications,
he
would
have
become
one
of
the
League's
greatest
summoners
were
it
not
for
one
terrible
mistake.
Too
impatient,
he
attempted
to
test
his
ability
by
summoning
a
beast
from
the
Plague
Jungles.
What
he
summoned
instead
was
a
young
boy,
but
not
in
one
piece.
He
barely
had
time
to
look
the
boy
in
what
was
once
his
face
before
the
jumbled
human
mass
fell
lifeless
to
the
floor.
A
League
investigation
later
revealed
that
the
boy's
entire
village
was
obliterated
by
feedback
from
the
ritual.
Lee
Sin's
talents
were
so
promising
that
the
League
was
willing
to
overlook
the
incident,
but
he
could
never
forgive
himself.
He
left
the
Institute
and
journeyed
to
the
Shojin
Monastery
for
eternal
repentance,
swearing
never
to
practice
magic
again.
Years
later,
hoping
to
atone
for
his
crime
with
martyrdom,
he
set
himself
ablaze
as
a
protest
of
the
Noxian
occupation
of
Ionia
.
He
remained
alive
in
this
state,
enduring
searing
agony
for
weeks.
His
actions
paved
the
way
for
a
League
match
wherein
Ionia
prevailed,
but
by
the
time
he
was
doused,
his
eyes
had
been
burned
completely
from
their
sockets.
Hailed
as
a
savior,
he
was
reborn,
and
his
will
to
act
invigorated.
He
joined
the
League
of
Legends
to
continue
his
atonement
with
sweat
and
blood,
a
true
monk's
only
possessions.
&quot;The
actions
of
one
may
sunder
the
world,
but
the
efforts
of
many
may
rebuild
it.&quot;

Protest
of
the
Shojin
Monk
Main
article:
Ionia
The
events
leading
up
to
the
Ionia
vs
Noxus
rematch
started
when
Lee
Sin,
a
monk
from
the
Shojin
Monastery,
set
himself
aflame
within
the
Ionian
Lotus
Garden.
He
would
not
allow
anyone
to
put
out
the
fire
until
the
three
regions
of
Southern
Ionia
were
freed
from
Noxus'
occupation.
[1]
Lee
Sin
remained
in
this
state
of
excruciating
pain
for
over
two
months.
After
Ionia
won
their
rematch
against
Noxus,
he
was
greeted
by
his
sister
from
the
now
liberated
Southern
provinces.
Only
then
did
Lee
Sin
allow
the
flames
to
be
extinguished.
Though
his
brethren
swiftly
brought
the
monk
back
to
the
monastery
for
treatment,
he
had
already
suffered
the
loss
of
his
eyes
due
to
the
intense
heat.

CLE
OBSERVATION
Lee
Sin
crosses
the
Great
Hall
with
an
aura
of
confidence
unusual
for
a
blind
man.
He
seems
to
gather
sensory
information
so
efficiently
it
makes
one
wonder
whether,
for
him,
blindness
is
a
weakness
or
a
strength.
His
physique
is
exceedingly
understated,
tuned
only
for
practical
use
by
years
of
martial
study.
What
he
lacks
in
size,
he
makes
up
for
with
presence.
His
conviction
is
absolute.
He
pads
straight
to
the
doors,
then
stomps
the
ground.
His
head
moves
up
the
door,
tracking
the
resulting
sound.
He
chuckles
at
the
inscription.
REFLECTION
A
damp
echo
trickled
outward
as
the
doors
thud
shut
behind
Lee
Sin,
painting
the
rooms
cramped
dimensions
in
his
mind.
The
sound
was
low
and
the
air
was
stuffy,
distorting
the
noise
and
accenting
his
mental
image
with
a
subtle
blur.
In
the
crannies
of
the
musty
stone,
fading
but
distinct
human
scents
lingered,
the
trace
pheromones
of
violent
emotion.
But
Lee
Sin
was
transfixed
on
the
overwhelming
stench
of
ready
magic.
Arcane
potential
loomed
in
the
air
around
him,
more
than
he
had
ever
sensed
before.
The
Reflecting
Chamber
swelled
with
it.
To
most,
it
would
be
imperceptible,
likely
misinterpreted
as
jitters
or
dread.
It
had
the
quality
of
the
calm
before
the
storm:
a
pregnant
stillness,
a
swindling
serenity.
Lee
Sin
knew
that
this
room,
in
its
current
state,
was
an
amplifier,
an
accelerant
for
sorcery.
He
could
taste
the
magical
anticipation,
like
a
static
charge
waiting
to
be
released.
The
aroma
of
fresh
pine
was
suddenly
everywhere.
He
stepped
back.
And
fire
engulfed
him.
The
sensation
was
familiar
more
than
anything
else.
Before
the
frantic
damage
reports
arrived
from
nerves
all
over
his
body,
he
shut
down
part
of
his
mind.
He
refused
the
pain
access.
Now
there
was
only
intensity
and
focus.
Here
he
was
again,
amidst
the
flames.
In
a
disturbing
way,
it
felt
like
home.
Five
months
had
passed
since
he
began
the
protest
of
the
Noxian
occupation
in
Ionia.
He
lit,
without
any
pretense
of
survival,
the
pyre
that
consumed
his
flesh
for
two
months.
In
that
time,
with
agony
tugging
at
his
sanity,
Lee
Sin
discovered
things
which
hid
deep
within
the
soul,
inner
truths
that
revealed
themselves
only
in
the
face
of
certain
annihilation.
Just
before
the
lapping
flames
were
to
claim
his
final
breath,
his
fellow
monks
arrived
with
the
news
that
Ionia
was
free.
It
was
a
cleansing
fire,
wasnt
it?
He
recognized
the
bold
timbre
of
his
former
mentor,
Reginald
Ashram,
as
acutely
as
the
blaze
surging
around
him.
Ashram
was
one
of
the
few
people
in
Valoran
privy
to
the
secrets
of
Lee
Sins
past.
Pain
does
not
heal
the
heart,
it
only
focuses
the
mind.
In
this
case,
it
focused
many
minds,
and
led
to
Noxus
withdrawal
from
Ionian
territory.
A
happy
turn
of
events.
Lee
Sin
smiled,
although
the
flickering
heat
on
his
face
made
him
wonder
if
Ashram
could
see
it.
But
you
still
havent
forgiven
yourself.
Lee
Sin
sank
to
a
meditative
pose
and
the
fire
billowed
in
return.
This,
ironically,
was
his
sanctuary.
The
past
remains,
no
act
will
undo
it.
His
tongue
knew
these
words
like
the
grooves
of
his
teeth.
Why
do
you
want
to
join
the
League,
Lee
Sin?
I
have
much
yet
to
do.
Explain.
Remaining
seated,
Lee
Sin
raised
one
hand
to
his
chest,
fire
dancing
upon
it.
He
swept
it
forward
so
sharply
that
the
pyre
flickered,
and
the
flames
on
his
arm
were
completely
extinguished.
A
decisive
strike
may
finish
a
battle,
He
paused
as
flames
crept
back
up
his
outstretched
arm,
but
the
evils
of
this
world
persist.
To
combat
them,
we
must
remain
diligent.
The
fire
reached
his
hand
again,
and
he
closed
it
with
such
force
that
a
shock
wave
rippled
out,
expunging
the
blaze
that
consumed
him.
The
wave
whipped
across
Ashram,
and
he
took
a
half-step
back.
How
did
you
survive
that
fire?
I
found
the
purpose
I
had
lost
so
long
ago.
And
what
is
that
purpose?
What
is
your
ultimate
goal?
There
was
an
urgency
in
Ashrams
voice,
a
hint
of
concern
that
puzzled
Lee
Sin.
Ashram
felt
threatened.
One
does
not
need
a
destination
to
have
direction.
Is
a
drop
of
water
finished
when
it
flows
from
the
brook
to
the
ocean?
Is
it
complete
when
it
rises
to
join
the
clouds?
Has
it
failed
when
it
falls
upon
the
land?
An
obliging
drop
of
sweat
rolled
down
his
forehead.
What
is
your
direction?
To
do
what
is
right.
To
protect
the
overlooked
things
which
matter
most.
The
drop
of
sweat
hovered
on
the
edge
of
his
brow.
You
can
find
them
in
the
bubbling
of
the
brook,
the
shade
of
the
passing
cloud,
or
the
coolness
of
the
rain.
On
cue,
the
drop
fell
to
his
waiting
palm.
Ashram
phrased
his
response
carefully.
Your
protest
moved
all
of
Valoran
to
action.
Nearly
to
military
action.
This
is
a
tremendous
amount
of
power
for
one
man
to
wield.
What
happens
if
that
one
mans
intentions
become
corrupt?
Then
I
hope
other
men
find
the
good
in
themselves
to
do
what
is
right.
The
inquisitor
reeked
of
frustration.
He
was
unused
to
vulnerability,
uncomfortable
with
all
that
Lee
Sin
could
perceive.
How
does
it
feel
to
expose
your
mind?
The
question
was
bitter
and
hollow,
deprived
of
its
usual
gravitas.
I
would
ask
you
the
same
question.
Silence
ensued.
Lee
Sin
knew
he
was
alone.
The
magical
potency
was
gone,
spent,
and
in
its
place
sat
an
atmosphere
of
somber
fatigue.
This
was
the
emotional
residue
of
those
who
had
completed
the
trial
before
him.
Its
flavor
was
bittersweet.
In
one
graceful,
fluid
motion,
Lee
Sin
was
on
his
feet.
His
clothes
and
skin
were
intact,
as
though
untouched
by
the
flames.
A
fresh
breeze
swept
through
the
room.
Lee
Sin
could
sense
the
shape
of
its
current
as
it
moved,
like
a
serpent
returning
to
coil
in
its
nest.
Lee
Sin
lingered
a
moment,
head
bowed
in
appreciation
of
the
champions
who
had
passed
this
threshold
before
him.
One
life
past,
one
life
ahead.
So
the
Blind
Monk
joined
the
League
of
Legends.

Blind

used
in

for
the
spectator.
His

It
was
said
that
he
was
remade
into

.
However,
Riot
Game

Guinsoo
hinted
that
this
was
not
the
case.
[3]
Hohums
later
confirmed
Guinsoo's
words.
[5]
It
has
been
strongly
implied
that
he
was
the
burning
monk
during
the
Ionia/Noxus
feud,
in
Issue
12
of
the
JoJ
,
stating
&quot;His
brethren
hastened
the
monks
blistered
body
swiftly
back
to
the
monastery
for
treatment.
While
it
was
clear
that
he
would
survive,
the
monk
had
suffered
the
loss
of
his
eyes
,
along
with
other
severe
injuries
from
the
intense
heat.&quot;
These
would
seem
to
corroborate
the
&quot;Mystic
Meditation&quot;
icon,
as
well
as
the
fact
that
flickers
of
flame
can
be
seen
in
its
portrait.
This
was
later
confirmed
in
his
League
Judgment,
and
Champion
Background.

end
a
tab
is
shown
titled
&quot;blindmonk.psd&quot;,
which
could
mean
that
artwork
is
being
done
for
Lee
Sin,
that
the
Rioters
are
trying
to
tease
the
Blind-Monk
fanboys,
or
that
the
artist
in
question
just
likes
working
on
Blind
Monk
for
fun.
Also,
in
the
video
&quot;Brolaf,
the
King
of
Bromacia&quot;
the
name
&quot;Blind
Monk&quot;
can
be
seen
on
the
New
Champions
Board
Here
.
This
however
was
most
likely
done
as
a
joke
by
the
staff
as
in
the
same
list
there
are
other
champions
Riot
has
long
stated
to
have
ceased
development.
April
Fool's
On
March
21st,
2011
Lee
Sin
was
re-confirmed
on
the
official
League
of
Legends
website
through
a
Champion
Sneak
Peek
.
On
March
22nd,
Riot
Games
released
art
via
their
YouTube
channel
which
includes
Urf,
The

.

On

24th,
the
&quot;A

article,
official
screenshots
of
Lee
Sin
can
be
seen.
Interestingly,
in
the
screenshots
the
deceased
champion
Urf,
The
Manatee,
can
be
seen
as
well.
On
March
28th,
Lee
Sin's
Champion
Spotlight
came
out
but
it
was
a
troll
video,
furthering
the
belief
that
he
wouldn't
actually
be
released.
However,
the
video
stated
that
he
wouldn't
be
released
with
the
V1.0.0.114
patch,
but
rather
on
April
1st
because
he
had
&quot;not
been
buffed
enough&quot;.
[2]
On
March
31st,
Lee
Sin's
actual
Champion
Spotlight
was
released,
once
again
stating
that
he
would
be
released
on
April
1st.
On
April
1st,
Lee
Sin
was
actually
released
and
became
available
to
buy
in
the
Store.
Champion
Sneak
Peek
Announcement
made
by
ByronicHero
on
22th
March
2011
[6]
:
Lee
Sin
Promo
Last
year,
around
this
time,
we
were
forced
to
say
our
goodbyes
to
a
loved
and
cherished
friend,
taken
from
us
so
tragically
and
so
senselessly
before
his
time.
On
April
1st
2010,
we
bid
farewell
to
Urf
the
Manatee.
It
was
a
trying
time
for
all
of
us
all,
and
many
came
forward
to
pour
their
hearts
out
and
memorialize
this
noble
prince
among
Sea
Cows.
If
theres
anything
that
the
death
of
Urf
the
Manatee
has
taught
us,
its
that
people
deal
with
grief
in
different
ways.
For
instance,
take
this
gentleman
here.
Lee
Sin
was
so
shaken
up
that
he
actually
ran
off
and
joined
a
monastery.
Now
hes
Lee
Sin
the
Blind
Monk.
Hey,
what
do
you
mean
youve
seen
him
before?
On
March
23rd
an
Art
Spotlight
featuring
him
was
added
to
the
Youtube
channel
of
Riot
showing
the
possible
final
concept
art
of
the
character.

Trivia
Lee
Sin
was
designed
by
Coronach

Lee
Sin's
name
is
a
homophone
of
the
word
&quot;listen.&quot;
A
rough
translation
of
his
name
in
Spanish
is
&quot;no
reading&quot;.
His
name
written
in
Chinese/Japanese
is
,
which
literally
means
&quot;Plum
Azure/Blue/Green&quot;.
[1]
In
Japanese
is
it
pronounced
as
&quot;Ri
Sei&quot;
(Ree-say).
His
self-immolation
from
the
lore
is
a
reference
to
the
real
life
monk
who
publicly
set
himself
on
fire.
He
did
this
as
an
act
of
protest
against
the
persecution
of
Buddhism
in
South
Vietnam.
Lee
Sin
is
the
first
champion
to
feature
two
champion
spotlights,
a
real
one
and
a
fake
one
for
April
Fool's.
Lee
Sin
is
the
first
champion
to
use
energy
that
is
not
a
ninja
.
Though,
similar
to
the
other
ninjas
,
he
is
a
champion
that
hails
from
Ionia
.
Lee
Sin
shares
a
quote
with
Soraka
,
&quot;Where
am
I
needed?&quot;
Lee
Sin
is
one
of
five
champions
to
have
more

.
Lee
Sin
was
the
second

to
have
more
than
4
skills.
Lee
Sin
is
the
first
monk
type
champion
announced

Sin
is
the
only
allegedly
cancelled
Champion
to
be
introduced
to
the
game
under
his
original
name.
Lee
Sin
was
a
cancelled
Champion
that
got
brought
back
by
community
popularity
and
support.
Lee
Sin's
dance
style
is
referenced
to
one
of
'Mighty
Steel
Legs'
moves
in
the
movie
Shaolin
Soccer.
A
side-by-side
comparison
can
be
seen
here
.
Lee
Sin
is
the
first
champion
to
be
re-designed
and
to
be
given
a
re-launch
skin
in
technicality
as
his
classic
skin
was
originally
the
Traditional
Lee
Sin
skin,
however
the
change
occured
before
his
release.
Skins
For
April
Fool's,
the
original
Classic
skin
artwork
used
to
have
the
deceased
champion
Urf,
the
Manatee
,
who
could
be
seen
at
the
bottom
left
of
the
artwork.
Traditional
Lee
Sin
resembles
how
he
looked
before
his
official
release
(seen
in
the
second
official
trailer).
Click
here
.
He
can
be
seen
at
around
0:11,
between
Jax
and
Teemo
.
Acolyte
Lee
Sin
was
meant
to
show
his
appearance
during
his
time
as
a
summoner
in
training.
Dragon
Fist
Lee
Sin
(Lunar
Revel
2012
event
release)
skin
is
a
tribute
to
Bruce
Lee,
the
famed
martial
artist/actor
of
1970's
action
movies.
The
skin
seems
to
be
specifically
referencing
his
trademark
look
first
seen
in
Enter
the
Dragon.
Dragon
Fist
Lee
Sin's
idle
animation
are
Bruce
Lee's
mannerisms
when
he
is
serious.
Lee
Sin
in
the
Chinese
servers
happens
to
also
have
the
same
character
written
for
his
last
name
()
as
Bruce
Lee's,
which
literally
means
&quot;plum&quot;,
and
with
it
being
a
common
Chinese
surname.
Muay
Thai
Lee
Sin
was
created
to
celebrate
the
launch
of
League

Legends
in
Thailand
and
pays
homage
to
Muay
Thai
,
a
combat
sport
native
to
the
country.

a
different
dance
animation

prior
being
Jurrasic
Cho'Gath
and
Dynasty
Ahri
.
His
dance
is
referenced
from
the
movie
&quot;Ong
Bak&quot;.
A
side-by-side
comparison
can
be
seen
here
.
Muay
Thai
Lee
Sin
is
very
similar
to
Sagat's
outfit
from
the
fighting
game
series
Street
Fighter
.
In
the
Poolparty
Lee
Sin
splash
art,
you
can
see

Lee
Sin
talking
to
Nidalee

Skill
usage
As
it
is
with
most
champions
,
the
key
to
becoming
a
skilled
Lee
Sin
player
is
to
adapt
your
strategy
to
maximize
his
passive
ability
.
Lee
Sin
can
burst
by
using
his
abilities
and
their
secondary
activations
in
rapid
succession
but
that
quickly
depletes
his
energy
.
Lee
Sin's
Flurry
adds
40%
attack
speed
to
the
two
basic
attacks
that
immediately
follow,
each
of
which
also
refund
15
energy
.
In
order
to
maximize
this
buff
's
effects,
stagger
(space
out)
your
abilities
with
autoattacks
in
between.
Sonic
Wave
/
Resonating
Strike
is
a
great
way
to
close
in
on
your
opponents.
You
can
use
Sonic
Wave
at
range
and
then
close
the
distance
with
Resonating
Strike
,
initiating
melee
combat.
Or,
if
you
are
already
in
melee
combat,
you
can
use
Sonic
Wave
as
you
fake
a
retreat,
hit
Resonating
Strike
,
and
re-enter
the
battle.
You
can
use
Sonic
Wave
/
Resonating
Strike
when
you
are
slowed,
go
through
some
walls,
and
chase
enemies
through
a
slowing
AoE
e.g.
Trundle's
Pillar
of
Ice
.
Be
careful
when
immediately
using
Resonating
Strike
after
Sonic
Wave
.
You
may
end
up
charging
right
into
a
turret
,
an
enemy
champion
in
the
brush
,
or
even
outnumbered
and
alone
if
you're
not
careful.
The
combo
of
Sonic
Wave
and
Resonating
Strike
plus
Safeguard
is
very
useful
for
hit-and-run
exchanges.
One
of
the
most
effective
methods
of
harassing
with
Lee
Sin
is
to
use
Resonating
Strike
to
attack
an
enemy
and
then
immediately
retreat
with
Safeguard
.
This
can
be
a
powerful
move
early
on
in
the
laning
phase.
You
can
begin
using
this
combo
as
early
as
Level
2
and
often
the
opposing
champion
(s)
have
limited
means
of
retaliation.
On
the
top
lane,
if
you
face
a
Champion
who
mainly
use
AOE
spells
to
harass
(e.g
Darius
and
his
Decimate
or
Renekton
and
his
Cull
the
Meek
),
You
can
force
him
to
push
the
minion
wave
without
getting
hit
by
using
the
method
mentioned
above
and
then
make
an
easy
gank
with
your
jungler.
Sonic
Wave
/
Resonating
Strike
and
Safeguard
is
also
effective
for
tower
diving
.
Smartcasting
Safeguard
might
be
just
enough
to
give
you
the
edge
you
need,
when
using
this
strategy,
to
dash
in
and
out
with
a
kill.
Safeguard
has
a
primary
defensive
use
but
it
can
be
effective
in
an
offensive
context
as
well.
If
an
enemy
champion
is
out
of
range
of
Sonic
Wave
,
but
is
in
melee
range
of
an
allied
minion
or
champion,
use
Safeguard
to
jump
right
in.
Safeguard
is
essential
to
have
&quot;leveled
up&quot;
when
you're
facing
off
against
a
bruiser
.
Safeguard
cannot
be
cast
while
snared,
even
if
Lee
Sin
targets
himself,
as
it
classified
as
a
dash/movement
ability.
If
you
are
engaging
an
enemy
that
has
a
snare
try
to
dodge
it
with
Sonic
Wave
/
Resonating
Strike
or
Safeguard
.
Alternatively
self
cast
the
Safeguard
preemptively
to
negate
(most
of)
the
snare's
damage.
Tempest
is
great
for
clearing
minion
waves
and
Lee
Sin
can
afford
to
spam
it.
Tempest
and
Sonic
Wave
is
a
great
combo
for
fighting
champions
with
stealth
or
those
trying
to
juke
or
hide
in
brush
.
Combining
both
skill
can
keep
an
enemy
revealed
for
up
to
7
seconds
and
at
higher
ranks
or
with
CDR
it's
enough
to
have
the
combo
ready
again.
If
Resonating
Strike
is
used,
the
target
will
no
longer
be
revealed.
However
using
Cripple
doesn't
stop
the
reveal
from
Tempest
.
Cripple
offers
great
utility.
Its
attack
speed
slow
is
useful
when
engaging
AD
enemies
with
Lee
Sin
and
the
movement
speed
slow
when
Lee
Sin
or
the
enemy
wishes
to
retreat.
Using
Dragon's
Rage
can
disrupt
the
enemy
team's
positioning
at
the
beginning
of
a
teamfight
.
Not
only
will
Dragon's
Rage
knock
an
enemy
back
(preferably
the
tank
or
bruiser
),
but
it
will
also
knock
up
the
champions
hiding
behind
him.
Dragon's
Rage
can
also
be
used
to
interrupt
a
channeling
ability
if
your
team
has
their
interrupts
on
cooldown.
During
a
team
engagement,
try
to
use
Dragon's
Rage
on
a
carry
who
overextends
to
isolate
them
from
their
team
and
pick
up
an
easy
kill.
You
can
also
use
Resonating
Strike
to
get
behind
the
carry
and
Dragon's
Rage
them
to
your
team,
temporarily
disabling
any
enemies
that
get
hit
by
their
own
carry.
Follow
it
up
with
a
Safeguard
to
get
back
to
your
team.
An
effective
method
of
picking
of
anyone
from
the
enemy
team
is
to
use
Sonic
Wave
on
the
target
champion,
followed
by
Safeguard
to
get
close,
followed
by
Tempest
and
Cripple
,
then
Dragon's
Rage
and
Resonating
Strike
into
your
team,
or
at
least
away
from
the
enemy.
This
applies
all
the
buffs
available
to
lee
sin,
as
well
as
quickly
bursting
down
the
select
champion,
getting
yourself
out
of
the
team
fight,
and
slowing
any
surrounding
enemies
from
following
you
afterwards
as
you
make
your
escape.
The
only
downfall
would
be
Lee
Sin
's
rapid
energy
depletion
during
this
combo,
though
if
well
timed
with
auto
attacks
can
be
very
effective
at
regenerating
Lee
Sin
's
energy,
as
well
as
picking
off
enemies
and
initiating.
It
is
not
advised
to
use
Dragon's
Rage
as
a
finisher,
as
one
incorrect
calculation
may
lead
to
the
target
escaping
instead.
You
have
to
make
sure
to
aim
Dragon's
Rage
correctly
as
this
can
prove
to
be
crucial
mistake
in
team
fights.
For
example:
kicking
an
enemy
champion
out
of
range
of
a
friendly
Amumu's
Curse
of
the
Sad
Mummy
.
A
cool
move
often
made
is
to
Sonic
Wave
+
Dragon's
Rage
and
then
Resonating
Strike
so
you
kick
the
champion
while
Sonic
Wave
's
mark
is
on
them
so
you
can
catch
up
with
Resonating
Strike
.
This
move
maximizes
your
damage-output,
since
Resonating
Strike
deals
damage
based
on
%
missing
health.
Lee
Sin
is
deceptively
resilient
in
fights,
and
as
such,
retreat
isn't
always
the
best
option
when
you're
losing.
Resonating
Strike
Does
significantly
more
damage
to
champions
with
lower
health,
which
is
usually
the
case
after
a
drawn
out
fight.
Using
Lee
Sin's
Sonic
Wave
followed
by
Dragon's
Rage
can
put
them
out
of
range
for
their
finisher,
allowing
you
to
easily
use
Lee
Sin's
Resonating
Strike
as
a
finisher.
Don't
forget
that
Iron
Will
heals
the
damage
you
do
with
your
abilities
including
Dragon's
Rage
healing
you
for
a
good
amount
of
health
when
cast
with
Iron
Will
active.
If
you
are
being
chased
by
2
or
more
foes,
wait
for
them
to
line
up
and
use
Dragon's
Rage
to
knock
up
the
chasers
Build
usage
As
all
of
Lee
Sin's
damaging
abilities
scale
only
on
bonus
attack
damage
,
attack
damage
items
are
crucial
to
his
build.
Depending
on
which
way
you
want
to
look
at
it,
either
Lee
Sin
's
damage
output
will
fall
off
as
the
game
progresses
without
attack
damage
items
or
Lee
Sin
scaling
well
into
late
game
with
attack
damage
items.
The
Bloodthirster
,
The
Black
Cleaver
,
or
Maw
of
Malmortius
are
good
choices
but
only
if
doing
well
or
pretty
late
in
the
game.
Getting
The
Bloodthirster
on
Lee
Sin
will
have
profound
effects
with
his
damage
output
and
regeneration.
Lee
Sin
requires
a
fair
amount
of
survivability
due
to
how
close
he
must
get
to
enemies
while
he
fights
and
the
time
it
takes
for
him
to
utilize
his
passive
,
getting
items
like
Wriggle's
Lantern
and
Hexdrinker
early
can
have
noticeable
results.
Building
Lee
Sin
tanky
is
important
because
to
use
his
ult
properly
he
needs
to
be
able
to
survive
being
in
the
middle
of
the
fight.
If
played
in
lane,
Atma's
Impaler
will
be
more
beneficial
than
Wriggle's
Lantern
,
especially
if
building
more
towards
the
tanky
side
of
tanky
DPS.
Randuin's
Omen
is
a
viable
item
for
Lee
Sin
,
complementing
his
ability
to
slow
movement
speed
and
attack
speed
.
Buying
an
Atma's
Impaler
is
generally
great
idea
for
a
Lee
Sin
building
health
and
consider
complementing
it
with
a
Frozen
Mallet
and/or
Warmog's
Armor
.
Getting
tanky
with
a
Frozen
Mallet
or
Warmog's
Armor
will
allow
you
survive
longer
and
eventually
give
you
more
attack
damage
if
you
get
Atma's
Impaler
and
increasing
maximum
health
.
Trinity
Force
is
a
good,
all-round
item
for
Lee
Sin
,
even
though
Lee
Sin
is
manaless
and
this
item
grants
mana
.
Since
he
has
7
skills,
he
can
constantly
proc
the
effects
of
Sheen
and
make
use
of
his
good
base
attack
damage
.
Coupled
with
his
passive
,
he
is
very
likely
to
proc
the
Phage
effect
giving
him
excellent
DPS
and
chasing.
Trinity
Force
will
also
provide
some
ability
power
to
slightly
improve
the
shield
from
Safeguard
without
sacrificing
an
item
spot
purely
on
AP,
in
addition
to
its
plethora
of
beneficial
effects
and
stats.
However,
given
his
strong
attack
damage
scaling
and
natural
squishiness,
it
is
best
to
get
Trinity
Force
late,
instead
going
for
attack
damage
/durability
items
such
as
Wriggle's
Lantern
,
Hexdrinker
,
Phage
,
or
a
few
Doran's
Blades
.
Lee
Sin
can
drop
a
tower
fast
if
he
has
Trinity
Force
because
his
low
CD
abilities
do
not
require
targets
to
cast,
allowing
him
proc
the
bonus
damage
every
2
seconds.
With
Youmuu's
Ghostblade
a
midgame
Lee
Sin
can
singlehandedly
push
a
turret.
When
playing
jungle
Lee
Sin
,
you
can
use
Wriggle's
Lantern
to
place
free
wards
for
not
only
vision
and
map
control,
but
also
for
synergy
with
Safeguard
.
This
allows
you
to
hop
over
walls
to
gank/escape
enemies.
Attack
speed
items
are
a
non-optimal
build
path
on
Lee
Sin
.
His
innate
Flurry
grants
him
natural
attack
speed
and
most
of
his
damage,
like
an
AD
caster
,
comes
from
attack
damage
scaling
abilities.
Jungling
Lee
Sin
is
one
of
the
best
junglers
having
both
great
clearing
speed
and
sustain
.
In
addition
to
the
above,
being
a
good
duelist
makes
him
a
great
counter
jungler
too.
Remember
to
use
Iron
Will
before
using
Smite
and/or
Sonic
Wave
,
as
it
restores
health
through
spell
vamp
.

Most
of
his
spells
deal

damage
.
Investing
in
armor
items
will
mitigate
his
damage
output.
However
Tempest
does
magic
damage
with
1.0
AD
ratio.
Resonating
Strike
will
deal
a
lot
of
damage
when
you
are
low
on
health.
Try
to
dodge
his
Sonic
Wave
so
he
can't
use
Resonating
Strike
to
finish
you
off.
Cripple
will
only
slow
you
if
he
hits
you
with
Tempest
.
Make
sure
you
stay
away
from
the
ability's
AoE
in
order
to
avoid
the
slow.
Beware
when
committing
to
kill
Lee
Sin
.
With
wards
in
his
inventory
to
place
and
cast
Safeguard
on,
jungle
monsters
or
enemy
minions
to
hit
with
Sonic
Wave
and
Resonating
Strike
to,
and
having
Dragon's
Rage
available
to
knockback
enemies
a
large
distance
or
knock
them
up
into
the
air,
Lee
Sin
has
an
enormous
amount
of
potential
to
escape
and
evade
dogged
enemies,
causing
said
enemies
to
waste
a
large
amount
of
time
chasing
him
at
best.
Instead
of
battling
him
in
minion
wave,
try
to
fight
him
when
he
is
alone
so
he
can't
make
the
full
use
of
the

from
his
Safeguard
.
Keep
in
mind
that
he
can
still
cast
Safeguard
on
himself
to
gain
its
shield,
plus
the
life
steal
and
spell
vamp
from
Iron
Will
.
Snares
also
stop
Safeguard
from
being
cast
at
all
within
their
duration.
When
playing
as
a
stealth
champion,
wait
until
Lee
Sin
uses
Sonic
Wave
and
Tempest
so
you
won't
get
revealed.
Lee
Sin's
Dragon's
Rage
will
knock
you
back
to
a
set
distance.
If
he
targets
you,
it's
better
to
run
away
in
the
direction
he
kicked
you
rather
than
running
through
Lee
Sin
to
escape.
Be
extremely
careful
not
to
use
Flash
to
escape
while
affected
by
Sonic
Wave
.
Lee
Sin
can
activate
Resonating
Strike
to
jump
to
you
from
a
long
distance
away,
as
its
range
is
1100.
Save
Flash
until
Sonic
Wave
wears
off
or
Lee
Sin
has
already
used
Resonating
Strike
.
Keep
in
mind
that
Lee
Sin
's
abilities
have
high
energy
costs
when
engaging
him.
He
will
be
vulnerable
and
unable
to
take
much
action
if
he
is
energy-starved.
Keep
your
team
spread
to
minimize
the
effect
of
his
Dragon's
Rage
.
Lee
Sin's
biggest
counter
is
time
since
his
damage
falls
off
greatly
late
game.
Play
carefully
early
game!
This
only
applies
if
Lee
Sin
does
not
affect
the
allied
carry's
late
game
and
does
not
build
AD
tank
items,
such
as
Atma's
Impaler
,
Frozen
Mallet
or
Maw
of
Malmortius
.
One
of
Lee
Sin
's
biggest
early
game
strengths
in
the
jungle
is
his
large
amount
of
sustain
using
Energy
and
his
dueling
ability
to
win
1v1
trades
every
champion
against
some
of
the
best
duelists
(early
game
Jax
,
Vi
,
Fiora
,
and
Xin
Zhao
),
most
assassins
(
Zed
,
Fizz
,
Akali
,
and
Talon
),
even
some
of
the
tankiest
junglers
(
Amumu
,
Rammus
,
and
Volibear
).
Please
keep
in
note
of
that
when
Lee
Sin
is
counter
jungling.
