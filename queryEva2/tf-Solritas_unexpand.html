         a &#x27;silly&#x27; build, though the Zhonya&#x27;s is certainly an interesting idea... I remember in my first year of solid playing I saw <b>TF</b> in the bot lane fairly frequently. Rarely played &#x2F;well&#x2F;, but he was a     ...  common enough pick. That does remind me that I need to play more <b>TF</b>, though... :P

    Make it Work! (An Off-Role Thought Experiment Game) 
   
   Not sure what your usual lane preference is, but have you tried playing Janna in top? Whether you went AP for crazy tornadoes or AD since her shield would be a free steroid, she has a lot of good tools to interrupt ganks and her ranged AAs would allow her to CS against some of the more aggro melee top laners. 
 If you went AD, I could see her doing pretty well with a Tri-Force or Iceborn Gauntlet. Shield someone, proc damage. Slow target, proc damage. Knock up enemy team, proc damage. Her values even when building for support mean her abilities should scale well enough to be useful on top of their utility even if your build weren't the 'normal' route.

    Make it Work! (An Off-Role Thought Experiment Game) 
   
   Heh, yeah, those two might cause some problems... But I had forgotten about the range boost! I'm one of those philistines who always goes for Death because I'm a DoT fanatic, but I need to remember that Viktor does actually have other options :P

   The laser-poke would probably be really nice down there, as would the shield-granting poke, but Gravity Well is a bit shorter range than some... It's be great if it worked, but it'd be a hell of a risk. Not to mention it's a lot of his supporting utility wrapped into a single ability, so once its on cooldown the enemy has an opening. Things to consider... 
 I imagine the damage output in that lane would be phenomenal, though. I'll add it to the list of things I need to try!

   Status Update! Just ran a AD Ryze/Support Tank Vi bot lane against a Jinx/Thresh. We won lane easily. Open your minds, people. The Meta is naught but a veil over your eyes!

   I... think I need to try this. I mean, minus the Cleaver that's more or less how I build Blitz, but I do love me some Urgot and the lane harass would be incredible! I like the way you think, sir!

   Makes me wonder if Team Builder might help to bring that back... He was really hampered by his short range, I think, and as Cait + Leona (and eventually Thresh) lanes came into prominence he just couldn't keep up anymore. With the right team to compensate and a decent chance the enemy team is playing something a bit off-meta, though? I think he could survive.

   Not sure if that exactly counts as a 'silly' build, though the Zhonya's is certainly an interesting idea... I remember in my first year of solid playing I saw TF in the bot lane fairly frequently. Rarely played /well/, but he was a common enough pick. That does remind me that I need to play more TF, though... :P

    [Champion Concept] Grak, the Vile Scavenger 
   
   Mostly because I'm still working through community college and haven't applied yet :P Should I ever get so lucky as to actually land a job in Riot, I'll be sure to bring this concept along with me! 
 Not to mention, I'm pretty sure this concept would be broke as hell and just a bit shallow if it was released as-is :P Gotta have some art and backstory and whatnot in there!

    [Champion Concept] Grak, the Vile Scavenger 
   
   As of 2/25/14: 
 
 Grak's W has been replaced entirely 
 Q now functions on a 'first hit marks' mechanic to make it more clear who is taking the damage and when 
 E's range is variable in both forms (Hook form based on distance charged, Saw form based on double-tap cancel function) 
 Ult has been turned into a targeted ability that snares. Were stats involved, damage would take a hit as a result.

   In all honesty, that ability is a hold-over from when this was a very different concept, and I liked the ability too much to get rid of it... You're right though, with how he's developed, it just doesn't fit anymore. I think I'll hold onto it until I can come up with something that really thematically meshes with that sort of mobility. 
 As for the ulti, I feel like it's overloaded already, but maybe that's just because I'm trying to go in too many different directions with it. The goal mechanically is to force the enemy team to decide between taking excess damage and splitting up, but once again I've deviated from that in terms of flavor and lore... I'll do some tweaking. Maybe it would work better as a charm-type effect or a snare? 
 You've given me some food for thought. Thanks especially for making it more apparent that I had strayed too far from my mechanics with my lore; I think in this case the flavor is the part worth salvaging, here.

   Huh... I hadn't considered him being in a support role, but I can totally see that being a viable option. He packs CC, some good poke threat, and it wouldn't be hard for him to get into poke range with stealth. 
 Interesting idea... Thanks for the +1!

    One Player's Last Shot 
   
   And with one last 57-minute loss, I think it's over... With my LP gains throttled down to the point of worthlessness, where a win could only get 2 points more than a loss took away, I think I'm simply too short on time... Four hours left, and 47 points to go. 
 Even if I managed to win the 8 games required to hit promotions in a row (assuming it didn't get lower as I got closer), there's no way I would have the time to play 3-5 promotional games alongside them in the time we have left... 
 So learn from my mistake, dear readers. If you think you will want whatever prizes the change of the season can grant you, start early! Hone your skills and master a few different lanes as soon as possible, for time and the perils of real life will have no mercy on you when the dreaded Time Crunch is upon us... 
 Congratulations to all who made Gold in time for the deadline. I hope to join you next season...

    One Player's Last Shot 
   
   First game of the night ended with only two kills on our team, both through tiny moments of the enemy simply not caring anymore. Nasus fed the Trynd, LeBlanc fed the Syndra, and the Ezreal I was supporting took more poke than he dealt damage over most of the course of the game... 
 It's not looking good for the poor little 'phish... I must try and keep my spirits up, or all is lost.

    -ou serious with this? That many icons will simply become -ing and it -y annoying to some people! You really ought to come up with your own of humor. It's not ex- -tly hard!

  2014 All-Star Challenge Game Mode Voting is now Live By Riot Shantzilla  The votes are in! You selected who you wanted to see competing in this year's All-Star Challenge, but that was only the beginning. Now that the player votes have been tallied and the rosters are being formed, it's time to kick your influence up a notch! 
 A while back , we told you that at this year's All-Star event we'd be showcasing the brand new All-Star Challenge. The new format will put you in control of some exciting and unique aspects of each days game modes. Well, the wait is over. 
 The first game mode is Hexakill! One match, two teams, and one giant six-player wrench thrown into the middle of it. How does your vote influence the game? 
 Starting April 13 through April 19, you'll be able to cast your vote for the sixth member of each Hexakill team. The five players eligible for your votes are: 
 Misaya China 
 Toyz Southeast Asia 
 Shushei Europe 
 Reapered Korea 
 Jatt North America 
 Remember, you can only vote once each week during the Game Mode votes, so make it count! You only have until 12:00AM PDT, April 19 to cast your vote for the Hexakill game mode, so don't waste any time. Head on over to vote.lolesports.com right now to tell us who you want to see slugging it out in the All-Star Hexakill!

  Go to the bug forums and whatever language you decide to use, use it properly if you want them to know what you are saying.

  Here's what i think Riot should do. Out of all the game modes we've had so far, riot should do a poll and see which one has the highest votes. The one with the highest vote gets to stay as a permanent game mode that is available to you. Just a suggestion Riot should take into account for the community for them to see which one the players liked the best.

      I myself only found out rather recently, and i couldnt help but wonder, Why? 
 Well i dont have the full list of banned skins, but i know of a few and why they are banned. 
 So apparently urfrider corki is not allowed to be played because his animations arent easily visible to spectators. 
 Underworld twisted fate is also banned. We all know that UW twisted fates cards are much smaller and harder to see/dodge than his classic skin. 
 Im just wondering, instead of banning these skins, shouldnt they just be fixed so that EVERYONE, not just lcs players/spectators, can play against them without being at a disadvantage? 
 I mean off the top of my head i can think of 2 other skins that have spell animations that are hard to read(santa gragas, steel legion lux) and could be improved. 
 Now i dont know how long, or how much resources would take up, but shouldnt this be fixed? Doesnt a certain skin having advantages in terms of gameplay basically make small elements of the game pay to win? Isnt this the exact opposite of what Riot wants?

  I know another one is iBlitzcrank. Though that's just an annoying skin in general. &quot;Hey let's make Blitz's distinct grab into a beam particle that has no readable hitbox because the hitbox ends at the fuzziest part of the animation which is super flashy btw, have fun dodging it!&quot; 
 I have issues with them allowing Wildfire Zyra because her roots are harder to see because they're dark red/black/orange as opposed to green, black, and red. Coming out of a bush it's pretty hard to see them since the flashiest part of the animation is from Zyra. However I'm not diamond so I can't say much. 
 Wandered through Reddit and found the beginnings of a list (link here: http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1vh9kp/banned_skins_in_the_lcs/cesepim 
) 
 Okay so here is the official list of banned Skins from the tournament realm, i expect them to be the same as the lcs ones, but i can't 100% confirm that:
Edit: People are saying that certain skins on the list were used in the lcs, so I will ask someone from Riot before cotinuing this list.

 I will continue this list after I slept if this gets enough upvotes since as you can see it's a huge ass list. 
 Have my doubts that these are ALL true (as the post is a month or so old) but most of these are accurate.

  Nice job finding a list like this. 
 The only thing is most of these skins are just not regularly available to buy anymore, i.e. Fiddlesticks' skins - Spectral(retired), Union Jack(limited) Pumpkinhead and Dark Candy (holiday). Correct me if I'm wrong, but these skins aren't available anyway on LAN because their tournament accounts are essentially &quot;new&quot; accounts with everything bought for them from the get-go. Not sure, but I think this is how it works.

  Steel legion lux is pretty cheaty. 
 The animation and sound for her snare are completely underplayed that I basically call out all steel legion lux players whenever I see them. 
 If you havent seen in, the animation plays a very subtle low tone instead of the typical sound we all know means dodge sideeays and the missile art for the rune is like this little spark that is very easy to not recognize. 
 All in all it means you spend the first couple trades losing because you got snared by something you really do know how to dodge. 
 But these people are starting to get rare seeing as they probably just bought drophacks

  Truth be told, light binding has always been a little sketchy to me even on her default skin (then again that might have been changed). Even at the pro level she can land a random Light Binding that you thought you dodged and land a free kill despite you having your flash up. Funny enough, on Steel Legion Lux I actually have a lot of difficulty landing her laser ult because the animation particle is wider than her classic... also I think it's a bit off-center so when someone has the ult PASS OVER THEIR MODEL and take no damage I just sigh and ff. 
 Lots of the classic skins have that, though. I know Classic Morg's Q animation looks much smaller than Blackthorn AND Ghost Bride because the outer ring of the animation is so darkly colored and fuzzy that it's no surprise people always give that shot a wide berth.

  Another unfair advantage skin is Justicar Syndra, the orbs are surprisingly difficult to see as their outline is almost non-existent. From my experience however the advantage gained is so small that it shouldn't have meaningful impact in online play. It's just (speculation) the fact that professional and tournament play involves money and that mean the possibility of lawsuits for any one-sided advantage no matter how small. 
 That being said I wouldn't mind having them 'balanced' myself.

  I do find I have similar issues. They're practically translucent and pretty impossible to see in bushes until they're almost spent.

  I agree. TF's very difficult to see cards and Santa Gragas's tiny Q's are the only one's i've personally found to be 'cheat skins' and i'd like to see them fixed up though for Gragas I doubt it'll be fixed up (assuming the rework didn't fix it, haven't seen that skin yet post rework) until they do a VU for him. Underworld TF is probably a case of not worth wasting the resources fixing it when so many other things need work, I just wish it'd been caught before release.

  Santa Grags is the most BS skin out there. I lost 3 games to that stupid tiny Q bag harass during the holidays... Took all that cheer right from me.

    Live Gameplay 
    Guidelines 
    
    As League of Legends continues to grow and change, we want to maintain a running dialogue on what goes into its evolution. 
 This subcommunity is focused on the live state of League of Legends. This is a den of discussion where we can openly share thoughts, ideas, feedback, analysis, and even criticisms of the live state of League of Legends. 
 Some guidelines to consider: 
 
 This is a place where due diligence is important: doing your homework before discussing live balance changes means that everyone can engage from a well-informed perspective. 
 Blatant misrepresentations of fact to make a point (or to get attention) probably won't get upvotes, but we'll reiterate here that they are also frowned upon. Draw out the real discussion and keep it constructive! 
 Change affecting your most beloved or most hated champion can be polarizing, but try not to let it cloud your voting. If a good point is made, don't downvote it just because you don't want to get nerfed. 
 Context is everything. League of Legends will constantly evolve through the seasons, so try to keep your discussions and suggestions framed in the present day. Remember this is the live game, so taking into account the state of the present is important!

  &quot;Hmmm, I think I see what's wrong,&quot; said Kennen M.D. (487 RP) . 
 &quot;What is it, doctor? Please, tell me!&quot; Replied Ezreal (440 RP), almost begging the doctor. 
 &quot;Well, it seems that URF's removal was just too painful for you. Trust me, it was painful for all of us.&quot; 
 &quot;I just don't get it!&quot; exclaimed Ezreal, &quot;this was a perfect mode to try out different strategies, combos, etc... Why not leave it at least in the custom games section?&quot; 
 &quot;Well,&quot; replied Kennen as he started removing his gloves, and cleaning up his desk, getting ready for his next patient, &quot;I guess that would be too much to ask.&quot; 
 Ezreal left the doctor's office, upset and annoyed. Gothic Orianna (260 RP) , who was Kennen's receptionist, greeted him with a cold, lifeless voice. Followed by her ball, which flew towards Ezreal at great speed in order to hand him the medical bill. He swiped his card on the ball, and then it flew back to Orianna. 
 &quot;Come again soon,&quot; her Glados-like voice replied. 
 As he stepped out into the streets, more annoyed than earlier, he heard a woman crying for help. 
 &quot;HELP!&quot; The woman cried. 
 Ezreal recognized that voice. It was Ahri (487 RP). Ezreal was a gentleman, so he knew he had to save her. 
 He used his arcane shift to move faster, but then he remembered URF was over. His cooldowns were back to normal, and so were his mana costs. 
 &quot;Damn it...&quot; he cursed under his breathe, as he tried running towards the damsel in distress. 
 &quot;Ezreal,&quot; said a voice beside him. Warring Kingdoms Jarvan IV (675 RP) was running beside him, &quot;you heard that too?&quot; 
 Ezreal nodded. 
 Soon, they saw Ahri nearby, running away and screaming. 
 Singed (292 RP) chased her with incredible speed, leaving puddles of poison as his trail. 
 Ezreal used his arcane shift and hit singed, then used his mystic shot. Both hits got the enemy's attention, who then started running at him. 
 &quot;Now!&quot; Ezreal yelled. 
 Jarvan leapt high up in the air, and then landed, smashing his spear on the ground, lifting a wall of rocks around them. 
 But Singed remained outside the rock. 
 &quot;What are you doing?&quot; Asked Ezreal. 
 &quot;I'm helping!&quot; He said. 
 &quot;Bring it down!&quot; 
 Singed laughed at this, as he tossed a bucket of his mega adhesive at them, and then continued chasing Ahri. 
 &quot;BRING IT DOWN!&quot; repeated Ezreal, &quot;just press R again!!!&quot; 
 &quot;Oh,&quot; replied Jarvan, as the walls around them crumbled into dust. 
 &quot;Screw this,&quot; said Ezreal, as he walked towards the opposite direction of the fight. 
 &quot;But...&quot; said Jarvan, &quot;the damsel in distress! We have to save her!&quot; 
 &quot;Well, that's what she gets for charming Singed,&quot; replied Ezreal without looking back. All he cared about now was going home, where dinner was probably ready by now, served in a bowl of rubies and a cup of emeralds.

          &quot;Hmmm, I think I see what's wrong,&quot; said [Kennen M.D. (487 RP)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuJFAdOEHcY).

&quot;What is it, doctor? Please, tell me!&quot; Replied Ezreal (440 RP), almost begging the doctor.

&quot;Well, it seems that URF's removal was just too painful for you. Trust me, it was painful for all of us.&quot;

&quot;I just don't get it!&quot; exclaimed Ezreal, &quot;this was a perfect mode to try out different strategies, combos, etc... Why not leave it at least in the custom games section?&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; replied Kennen as he started removing his gloves, and cleaning up his desk, getting ready for his next patient, &quot;I guess that would be too much to ask.&quot;

Ezreal left the doctor's office, upset and annoyed. [Gothic Orianna (260 RP)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KYuB_i5RgI), who was Kennen's receptionist, greeted him with a cold, lifeless voice. Followed by her ball, which flew towards Ezreal at great speed in order to hand him the medical bill. He swiped his card on the ball, and then it flew back to Orianna.

&quot;Come again soon,&quot; her Glados-like voice replied.

As he stepped out into the streets, more annoyed than earlier, he heard a woman crying for help.

&quot;HELP!&quot; The woman cried.

Ezreal recognized that voice. It was Ahri (487 RP). Ezreal was a gentleman, so he knew he had to save her.

He used his arcane shift to move faster, but then he remembered URF was over. His cooldowns were back to normal, and so were his mana costs.

&quot;Damn it...&quot; he cursed under his breathe, as he tried running towards the damsel in distress.

&quot;Ezreal,&quot; said a voice beside him. [Warring Kingdoms Jarvan IV (675 RP)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6MC_NRmDdE) was running beside him, &quot;you heard that too?&quot;

Ezreal nodded.

Soon, they saw Ahri nearby, running away and screaming.

Singed (292 RP) chased her with incredible speed, leaving puddles of poison as his trail.

Ezreal used his arcane shift and hit singed, then used his mystic shot. Both hits got the enemy's attention, who then started running at him.

&quot;Now!&quot; Ezreal yelled.

Jarvan leapt high up in the air, and then landed, smashing his spear on the ground, lifting a wall of rocks around them.

But Singed remained outside the rock.

&quot;What are you doing?&quot; Asked Ezreal.

&quot;I'm helping!&quot; He said.

&quot;Bring it down!&quot;

Singed laughed at this, as he tossed a bucket of his mega adhesive at them, and then continued chasing Ahri.

&quot;BRING IT DOWN!&quot; repeated Ezreal, &quot;just press R again!!!&quot;

&quot;Oh,&quot; replied Jarvan, as the walls around them crumbled into dust.

&quot;Screw this,&quot; said Ezreal, as he walked towards the opposite direction of the fight.

&quot;But...&quot; said Jarvan, &quot;the damsel in distress! We have to save her!&quot;

&quot;Well, that's what she gets for charming Singed,&quot; replied Ezreal without looking back. All he cared about now was going home, where dinner was probably ready by now, served in a bowl of rubies and a cup of emeralds.

  Not really. His stories are amazing, don't get me wrong, but the main reason most people come here is to see the sales, and consider buying the skins or champions. So spotlight links are more relevant to the majority of people who view these posts. 
 Although I still greatly enjoy moriuz's stories and come by for them on occasion. :P

  Yeah you are. 
 We're all just &quot;some guy&quot; or &quot;some girl&quot; on the internet. That's how it works. 
 Way to sound pretentious though.

  She is amazing, I agree, but this time she got screwed because she charmed Singed. 
 It's like when Blitzcrank pulls Fiddlesticks into the team right after he ults (I actually did that once, oh boy, was my team angry! XD)

  You should also post champion spotlights or guides or something, it would be nice for people who don't know how the champions on sale work. (Which is probably very uncommon, but it would still be cool.)

  Kennen is a Doctor, 
 a pretty good one too. 
 If you have a problem 
 he's sure to assist you. 
 Unless of course your problem, 
 involves URF's goodbye. 
 For problems of the heart 
 his profession's for nigh. 
 Warring Kingdom Jarvan, 
 with that armor on his back, 
 looks ready to go to War, 
 just to bring URF back. 
 Orianna decided 
 (like depression on Hoth) 
 that because URF is gone 
 she would become a goth. 
 But Ahri, she looks happy, 
 and ready for a fight. 
 Even with those cooldowns 
 she'll put you in a plight. 
 Ezreal is okay too. 
 I mean, his URF was fun, 
 but even without spamming 
 his Ultimate a ton 
 he finds the League to be 
 a pretty epic game. 
 Even though the matches 
 will never be the same. 
 And finally there's Singed, 
 though he always looks sad. 
 So I cant tell if URF's goodbye 
 has left him feeling mad. 
 Well, although URF has gone away, 
 there's no reason to fail 
 and rage quit inside of your life 
 cause this is a good sale. 
 Ad even if you think 
 this sale is crummy too, 
 well then all you sad people, 
 this poem is for you.

  Urf was a knock off mode, similar to Snowdown and one for all, where it was there to enjoy but falls off after a while.Instead of complaining I think more people should have been thanking Rito for keeping it more than the announced amount of time :/

   Do you take into consideration whether a champion will have line of sight after using a dash as a heuristic for how advantageous an ability is to use? 
 Out of curiosity what do you use for AI structure? It sounded like it was just a super simplified decision tree. I'm guessing it's a little more complex than that?

    @IronStylus @ohmikegoodness @FeralPony Thanks for PAX! 
   
   I ran into you probably 30 minutes before PAX ended on Sunday. I'm a guy and I was wearing a green shirt at the time with medium length brown hair. Probably had my backpack with me but so did everyone else.

    Who's going to be at PAX East? 
   
   My school got a booth for game dev majors so I'll be there presenting. I've never been so I don't have a clue what to expect.

    @Morello: An alternative to Marksman bot lane? 
   
   You also need to take into account the range of those champions. Ask yourself who you'd be comfortable taking shots at a tower with during a late siege. Immediately rule out all melee champions. Kog stands out with 710 range. The next highest is a group with 550 range. Eventually you get down to Teemo's range. 
 I don't think any item solution should force AS onto a hypothetical AP pusher's build. Thinking back to my original proposal I think that's a bad idea too. At least it is while ADCs don't have to go out of their build path to push towers. 
 Alternatively find a way to make ADCs worse at pushing towers, like making crit a stronger stat and AS a weaker stat since you can't crit towers. In that case I'd say it's fine to introduce a &quot;buy me to push&quot; item because it's not a &quot;you need to buy me to push while others don't&quot; item. Everybody would be on equal footing.

   That's why I said an additional percentage. 
 Lichbane is a great item for pushing towers because it can usually sneak its way into a kit without going out of your way. But yeah mages don't build attack speed. Why would they? It doesn't scale with anything in their kit. I'm saying mages need an item that scales their kit normally and can push towers. Or just bump up the existing 40% AP ratio to account for the lack of attack speed on mages.

    @Morello: An alternative to Marksman bot lane? 
   
   I really don't think you're going to make much headway with that until you address the fact that ADCs are OP at pushing compared to every other class. 
 Just a random thought, but to make APs push turrets harder lategame might you make an AP item with a passive that applies an additional percentage of your AP to turrets? 
 Theorycraft aside though, I really wanted to try a Cassy/Lulu bot lane since Cassy plays a lot like an ADC and Lulu has an AP Janna shield. Then you went and took away Lulu's AP buff. I want you to know I hold you personally responsible for that :(

    [4.6] Patch Forecast 
   
   Statikk you mentioned a problem with jungle tanks. Has Riot ever considered including/modifying jungle camps so that the camp isn't defeated by using only damage? For instance, a camp where the clear time is related to your defensive stats or utility abilities? I think that would open the jungle up to a wider variety of champions.

    I wonder when Riot will understand, SUPPORT ISN'T A BACK UP MID 
   
   &amp;lt;Continued from other post&amp;gt; 
 Try looking at this as an analogy to Renekton and Mundo. Renekton's generally known for having a strong early game, but he falls of lategame. Mundo is the opposite. You can still differentiate between an early game and late game support. Look at Soraka; she's strong late game. Compare a Janna whose shield AD scales starts low and scales to be huge vs a Janna where it starts decently but doesn't scale well. The former would be valued if you manage to get to the lategame, and the latter would be valued early game. 
 The difficulty in doing this arises when CC is thrown into the mix. CC puts you out of position, which even for a split second can mean your death in LoL. CC never really &quot;falls off,&quot; so there's really not much different between an early game CCer and late game CCer. Actually I'd say the scaling CC is worse because &quot;early game&quot; CC gets the job done and &quot;late game&quot; CC is overkill with a bad early game. It's like comparing a Blitz hook into 5 people to a Blitz hook and Morg snare into 5 people. Either way the person that got hooked is probably dead, so why bother with the snare? 
 The last thing I want to say is about LB &quot;support.&quot; I would call that a support only very loosely. I'd more just call that a duo lane with a mage with some utility. If a Nami went into a solo lane I'd still call her a support. She's just a richer support with nobody to support.

    I wonder when Riot will understand, SUPPORT ISN'T A BACK UP MID 
   
   
 You don't say BT is utility because it gives lifesteal, so why should Rylai's be utility because it grants a slow? 
 
 The item itself is not utility, it's what the item is used for. Though I would say that Rylai's has utility even if it isn't designed specifically for utility. Imagine if there was a support with a slow that scales hard with AD (and for the sake of argument AD doesn't contribute to this champion's AA). For that champion a Bloodthirster certainly would contribute to the champion's utility. My point is that it's how the champion uses the stat that determines what the stat is classified as. 
 As another example that's probably a lot cleaner that an AD scaling support... look at CDR. Let's say Ziggs gets CDR capped. He's going to be tossing out a ton of Qs for a ton of damage. In this case it's clearly a damage scaling. Now let's say Nami gets CDR capped. She's going to be tossing out a ton of Ws for a ton of healing. Now it's a utility scaling. Again, my point is that it depends on how your abilities scale that determine what the stat is for. 
 
 If all supports start picking up Rylai's, DFG, and Deathcap, wouldn't that be just as non-unique as everyone building SS, Ascension, Crucible? 
 
 I'm not annoyed about active items because they're cookie cutter. I do think cookie cutter builds are an issue, but a separate issue. I have two problems with support items; One problem is with actives and the other is specifically with the gold items. 
 My problem with actives I think I've said pretty clearly, but I could clarify it a little more. I understand this is opinion. It's more that I hate any active item rather than hating a cookie cutter build of active items. Cookie cutter builds are annoying because there's a dominant strategy in terms of build path. That's true of any cookie cutter build, active items or not. Active items have the addition problem of that each individual active takes away from the champion's identity. It takes away from my choice of champion if I know I will always be able to buy an item to remove CC, even if my champion was a minion. 
 
 I don't mind the fact that I'm &quot;required&quot; to get a sightstone. You really aren't required to get a gold generation item, I've done numerous games where I don't and can still keep up in gold by being smart about my activities and helping to make plays with my other purchases. You don't need to abuse AP items to be a useful support. I will always believe that a support that is providing solid vision for their team and working to deny enemy vision is drastically more helpful and impactful in a game then a &quot;support&quot; that is blatantly ignoring vision responsibilities to build AP trying to carry. 
 
 My problem with gold items is because gold items were an incomplete solution to lack of gold. Sure you can manage without a gold gen item, but you're not going to have the same gold as another teammate that doesn't need to go out of their way to have gold. 
 And I'm not at all debating that a ward bitch isn't impactful. It's that being a ward bitch, albeit less of a ward bitch than in S3, is playing a totally different game. Again, you're not being valued for your kit. You're being valued because you can buy an effect (vision) that everybody has access to. This problem is very intertwined with the vision system being implemented through (consumable) wards. Ideally I would like to see a vision system that cannot be optimized so that one player carries the majority of the burden. That way I could participate in vision &quot;responsibilities&quot; to the same degree as everyone else and build items that have synergy with my kit. 
 
 ...that should matter. Currently it still does, but constantly shifting everything to scaling will gradually reduce that relevance, ... 
 
 This isn't a problem with scaling existing. This is a problem with being able to obtain scaling even if you're shut down. 
 &amp;lt;Character limit reached. Will continue in another post&amp;gt;

    I wonder when Riot will understand, SUPPORT ISN'T A BACK UP MID 
   
   Don't take this personally but I could not disagree with you more. 
 First off let me ask you this: Why do you call AP items offensive items? Void staff is offensive, I'll give you that, but that's because pen is just messed up. All AP items do is scale something. It does not have to be an offensive scaling . That being said, it's fine if supports scale offensively. I think offensive damage scalings should not be on supports. 
 What I really don't understand is why people would rather be buying traditional support items over scaling items. It doesn't make you stronger by enhancing your kit. It makes you stronger by giving you an ability that anyone could have. It strips uniqueness away from supports. It's the difference between saying &quot;I can't wait to get money on Nami to make my heals huge&quot; and &quot;I can't wait to get money on Nami to buy an item that has nothing to do with my kit.&quot; I find nothing appealing about the latter, and I'm glad Morello shares my opinion. To be clear, buying AP items on supports does not make you selfish. You're scaling your ability to support. I would rather have a different stat than AP be used for utility scaling though. It would mean you get to balance items that supports and mages will be using separately. 
 I'll give you this: You're right that supports shouldn't need 3 huge items just to break even with where they were before the changes. But keep in mind that supports had huge base utility because they were expected to have no gold. Their base utility had to suffice. I think what you really don't like is that with a generic pickup of sightstone + gold gen item you're not getting anything out of your utility scalings. You pretty much have to get these items though. That's the massive disadvantage of trying to fix the gold issue with items. Supports are absolutely forced to get those items, which means they can't take advantage of their utility scalings. 
 To backtrack, I said that supports were given huge base utility because they were expected to not get gold. But everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked support changes came through. Actually that's not true. Leona (for the most part), Thresh, and Annie didn't change. Their utility still does not scale. Their abilities have the same base effect that they always had, which were purposely made strong to work without gold. Now they have gold and strong bases. That is why I suggested nerfing their bases and adding a scaling. You say the issue is that scalings in their own right are bad, but that's wrong. It's that depending on scalings is bad when your opponent does not depend on scalings. If you want to call something power creep it would be the state of support bases prior to the changes. Supports became less and less farm dependent until you ended up with supports like Thresh and Leona whose utility has no change regardless of whether they have 0 AP or 1000 AP. Now look who's consistently strong: the two supports who were given that huge base power, none of which was replaced with scalings. Until you get rid of that power creep then supports who depend on scalings will have a harder time.

    I wonder when Riot will understand, SUPPORT ISN'T A BACK UP MID 
   
   When you're comparing strong base utility with no scaling to scaling utility then of course it will be bad. It's because Riot put utility on so many champions - not just mages - that we're running into problems. 
 When Yasuo came out a Rioter said Riot was focusing more on personal mobility over CC for catching power. The reason is because CC is catching power for everyone, meaning you can stack them together. Personal mobility is only catching power for yourself and not stackable. 
 My point? Riot acknowledged that they really shouldn't be putting CC on everything. What's more is that anything that isn't a support shouldn't have scaling CC because it's not cohesive with the champion's purpose. The precedence is the complete opposite. Nobody had scaling utility, so of course anything that depends on a scaling is going to be comparatively bad. That's why I said put utility scalings on more thing and replace team utility with personal utility for those without scalings. 
 That aside, you're saying utility scalings are bad when supports still tend to focus on items that oftentimes don't scale their utility. Yes, I'm talking to you Sightstone, Crucible, and Talisman.

   I think the clear solution to that is to make mage/tank utility scale and nerf the base utility. Leona, Annie, and Thresh's utility doesn't change based on their income. The exception to this is CDR, but that applies to everyone. 
 For example, make Thresh's lantern distance shorter, but scale. Make his hook pull the target a shorter distance, but pull closer to him with a scaling. Basically it would scale from a bandage toss to a naut hook to a blitz hook given enough AP/whatever scaling. 
 The same thing goes for Leona, except her kit is difficult to give utility scalings without touching CC duration. And Riot said no on scaling CC duration.

    @FeralPony Self cast as an alternative to mouse target 
   
   
 ACTIVE (ON ENEMY CAST): Elise and her Spiderlings lift up into the air, becoming untargetable for 1 second and revealing nearby enemy targets for the duration. She then descends upon the target enemy. 
 ACTIVE (ON GROUND CAST): Elise and her Spiderlings lift up into the air, becoming untargetable for up to 2 seconds. During that time she can cast Rappel again to descend upon a targeted enemy. If no enemy is targeted within 2 seconds, she will descend at her original location. 
 
 I'm saying that self casting the ability will behave the same way as ground cast. There is nothing changing how the ability itself works. It's only her Rappel. It has nothing to do with her human form. I'm not sure why you think otherwise.

    @Feral Pony Questions about unpopular items 
   
   I'd have to try out different iterations of the item ofc, but you raise a good point. I think I would buy the item if lifesteal weren't already such a good counter that is in my core build path. That and sustain supports can be countered by a quick sustain item. So I think the problem is twofold: Sustain supports need to outscale a vamp scepter and there needs to be an item to counter the new, stronger sustain.

    @Feral Pony Questions about unpopular items 
   
   Why not make a weaker, cheap version as a lane counter and have it build into something better lategame? You might even make 2 upgrade branches: one with relatively good stats but a weaker GW effect and one with relatively poor stats and a strong GW effect. Make the passive mutually exclusive.

    [Item Reworks] Pyro's Item Overhaul 1 - Expanding Support: Talisman&amp;amp;Aegis Revamp and much more 
   
   Nesting limit is reached so this is intended for bruno. 
 I played s1 and s2, and I fail to see how this would cause any kind of relapse into s1/s2 state. Lowering the ridiculous item costs that ADCs have wouldn't change support gold at all.

   It changes nothing about their level of counterplay. Making ADCs less item dependent or making the items cheaper just means they have the same capabilities, but it doesn't take them half an hour of split pushing and taking all the farm to reach that point. ADCs are like that partly because their items are more expensive than items for other roles and partly because ADCs are so dependent on the multiplicative nature of the stats.

   That depends on how you split it. It doesn't need to be 50/50. It could be 70/70. Or Riot could just make ADCs not so ridiculously item dependent or make AS/Crit items cheaper.

    [Item Reworks] Pyro's Item Overhaul 1 - Expanding Support: Talisman&amp;amp;Aegis Revamp and much more 
   
   No I haven't, and to be brutally honest I don't care what other games have done. I dislike the concept in general. Like I said, item effects dilute the focus away from the champion. Talisman is still going to provide a ton of utility whether I'm playing Janna or a purple caster minion. 
 Supports in LoL throughout S3 were designed with lack of gold in mind. For the most part CC doesn't scale in LoL, so anyone that has CC is going to have access to their power regardless of how much money they have (Annie, Zyra, Leona, etc.) IMO that was a terrible design and I'm glad Riot did something to change it. 
 But granting money through items isn't a very fun way to patch the problem. Like I said before, I don't like most item effects. All of the gold gen items have actives on them which, like you said yourself, make you choose between the actives and the gold gen mechanic. Aside from that you're generally taking up 2 item slots (gold gen + sightstone) before you have any form of customization. Taking another item prior to that means you're not only delaying your &quot;core&quot; build, but you're delaying your income. 
 What I really don't like is that there's a much simpler, obvious solution, which is to just split gold between the last hitter and the closest ally in range. Again, the whole spiel is in the thread I linked.

    [Item Reworks] Pyro's Item Overhaul 1 - Expanding Support: Talisman&amp;amp;Aegis Revamp and much more 
   
   TBH I skimmed after a bit and read the TL;DR, but I think what I'm going to say is applicable. 
 I'm not a fan of any item based solutions for supports for a couple big reasons. 
 1) I dislike an item being valued over the support's kit. Talisman and old Aegis were my big offenders here. Regardless of who you're playing you can still give a sivir ult to your entire team. 
 2) Item based solutions mean you always have to buy those items in order to access the solution. This applies to junglers too. I'd so much rather see Riot fix the underlying mechanic that causes the problem than have a band-aid thrown on. 
 I posted a thread on GD about a week ago detailing what I don't like and how I'd go about fixing it if you're interested.

    [Champion Rework] Ashe, the Frost Archer 
   
   Out of all the Ashe reworks I've seen (and I've seen a lot) I think I like this one the best. Most Ashe reworks I hate, but you managed to keep everything about her theme and mechanics. 
 My only complaints come from the passive. First off, the slow falls off before Ashe can get a second AA off until she has &amp;gt; 1 AS. To outpace the 0.5 falloff she needs &amp;gt; 2 AS. Aside from that, attacking instantly after the slow falls off reapplies the slow, which means very carefully timed AAs can pretty much permaslow someone. But the cost is that it feels really clunky. I think you should either just make it an actual permaslow or change it into something meaningful that can't be abused into a permaslow. 
 Also the physical damage on her ult could be a bigger deal than you think. I see that you've brought down the damage to compensate for the scaling, but keep in mind that the physical damage is affected by armor pen.

    I think I've come up with a good Ashe Passive 
   
   I think you nailed what people don't like about the current passive, but I think your solution is a little too RNG early game. Ashe seriously lacks dueling potential in early lane, and depending entirely on RNG is risky. The annoying thing with probabilities is that the expected output is a probability. It's not guaranteed to occur. You might crit once every 10 AAs, you might crit once, you might not crit at all, or you might crit all 10. Small sample sizes, which lane trades are, are a poor example of the expected value. 
 If you look at her current passive it has zero randomness to it. You are guaranteed a crit at 100 stacks, and you're guaranteed to have your normal crit chance without 100 stacks. 
 After 10 trades with 2 AAs each there's a 72% chance to crit at least once. 
 Emphasis on the at least though. In those 10 trades there's also a 3.85% chance to crit 2 times in the same trade. Critting twice with a volley in 1 trade is pretty much a lane winner. I'm too lazy to calculate what the probability to crit any 2 of the 20 autos are, but you get the idea.

    I think I've come up with a good Ashe Passive 
   
   That's not how probability works. 
 P(crit OR crit) = Not (P(Not crit and not crit) =1-(1-P(crit)^2) [Assuming independence, which the events are] = 12.1% 
 After 5 trades you have roughly a 53% chance to have not crit. After 10 trades you have roughly a 28% chance to have not crit. 
 But that aside, you're right that she has no damage steroid. But that's not her only problem. Without her ult Ashe has terrible dueling potential. Her range and AS are her only strong stats. On top of that, her level 2 is really weak because she gains no combat prowess with a second ability.

    @Riot: CDR niche item suggestion for AA boosting ADC champions 
   
   Emphasis on some mana. Like 250 after upgrading. The reason muramana isn't a great item on ADCs that have mana problems is that it's incredibly overkill. It could synergize well with MM. 
 But regardless I think you're going to have a problem with it fitting in since ADCs need all their other items. Until that gets fixed I think any new item is just goign to suffer from either being OP or not good enough to replace IE+PD+LW+BT.

    @Riot: CDR niche item suggestion for AA boosting ADC champions 
   
   Not armor pen, but I like the idea. I'd rather see CDR, AD, crit, and some mana. Keep in mind the item's going to be contending with all those items ADCs can't live without atm. I'm assuming the passive is unique with IE?

    I'm Not Happy About Support Items and Here's Why 
   
   Back toward the end of season 3 I suggested a dedicated support stat a couple times. As soon as I mentioned scaling CC people flipped out. I think scaling CC - maybe not hard CCs - would definitely help supports out a lot. That being said, as long as there are stuns with base durations strong base durations like Annie's then they'll push out real supports.

    It's Time -You- Listen Riot: 
   
   That's not at all impossible in Reddit format. Just make it so Recent takes into account current activity as well as or instead of thread creation date. Just not to the point that one post or multiple posts from the same person makes the thread shoot back to the top (i.e., bumping).

    Runaan's Hurricane design is parasitic. 
   
   I think the biggest problem isn't that ADCs have better multiplicative scaling with AD/AS/Crit/ArPen, but that they need all of that multiplicative scaling to work well. Hurricane doesn't scale with crit, which automatically kills it because it because ADCs pretty much require crit. Not only that, but Hurricane contends with Shiv and PD for an item slot. Hurricane only gives AS. I'm not saying Hurricane should be another zeal item, but it lacks so much in comparison to what you're giving up. 
 On hit champions have historically been pretty weak. Items with on hit effects only scale off of attack speed. The sole exception to this is the new Nashor's Tooth. ADCs scale off multiple stats that all scale with each other. To top it off, on hit effects generally do not affect structures. 
 Another problem with on hit champions is that their stats and kits generally aren't really cohesive with an auto attack heavy playstyle. If you look at ADCs you usually find long range and/or some mobility. Kog has the range without any mobility. Teemo has some mobility and a pretty good kit for dueling ADCs, but severely lacks range and can overwrite his own dot with repeated attacks against the same target. TF has pretty lackluster range and no mobility. Kayle on the other hand has strong scalings with her abilities, can kite well with her Q despite her range, and doesn't lose damage like Teemo does. 
 With all of these problems together on hit just isn't a very effective mechanic. I think on hit as a mechanic needs to be reworked. More on hit items should scale with AP rather than by a flat amount, existing on hit AP scalings should be a little stronger, and on hit effects should apply to structures in more cases.

    Removing Lulu's AP Bonus from Whimsy lowered her skill cap 
   
   I doubt that's the case. Vlad's passive would have a similar problem and they made that work.

    Instead of Best/Recent use a slider 
   
   The most obvious time I'd want something like this is to look for new-ish posts that have gained traction. With Best I'm just going to get the all time best which are probably not going to change. With Recent I'm going to get anything new, regardless of popularity. With Hot you get some upvoted stuff, but most of it's just just newer posts. Sliding it 3/4 to Best would weight popularity heavily, but not discount novelty. 
 In terms of the math, I'm sure Riot already uses some numerical score for how recent or how popular a thread is. It's just a matter of weighting them by the slider amount.

   Anything in mind? My next feature to implement a navmesh along with path smoothing. 
 The only thing that immediately comes to mind is a wave defense kind of game where you need to hold off minions from different lanes, but that could take a while in its own right.

    Updated Patch Notes layout. Thoughts? 
   
   Strikethrough in general just makes it more strenuous to read, especially when combod with the red font. IMO something like this would be more appropriate for Kayle (nothing special about Kayle): 
 
  Kayle 
 We lowered Reckonings AP ratio while raising the AP ratio of Divine Blessings heal. We also added an AP ratio to Divine Blessings movement speed bonus and removed Interventions mana cost. 
 Once she gets ahead, Kayle's burst damage can be overwhelming to play against. While we're taking away some of Kayle's up-front burst, the utility scaling on Divine Blessing should help her and her team get INTO (and out of) THE FRAY. 
 
 Q - Reckoning 
 
 Reckoning's burst damage was too high so we reduced the AP ratio. 
 Ability power ratio: 
 
 Old :: 1.0 
 
 New :: 0.6 
 
 
 W - Divine Blessing 
 
 Divine Blessing's heal was too weak compared to other champions, and we wanted to extend the recent utility scaling changes to Kayle. 
 Heal/Ability power ratio: 
 
 Old :: 0.35 
 
 New :: 0.45 
 
 
 Movement speed bonus: 
 
 now scales with ability power (+7% per 100 ability power) 
 
 
 R - Intervention 
 
 Reason (I have no idea why she got this) 
 Mana cost: 
 
 Old :: 100 / 75 / 50 
 
 New :: 0 at all ranks 
 
 
 
 
 You're going to have to use your imagination here since I couldn't do everything I was trying with the formatting. Substitute the block quotes and list bullets for indents and decrease the vertical spacing between the header and the block quote(caused from the header format). Personally I think this is more readable and the reason for each specific change is available right next to the change. 
 Also as I was making that I noticed that the color and size of &quot;Ability Power Ratio : :&quot; made it kind of annoying to read. I'd suggest increasing the font size by a point or 2 and/or darkening the color just a little bit.

   I'm not a fan of the strikethrough format. It feels redundant and cluttered. Specifying that values were lowered at later ranks, for example, felt easier to read and showed your intent more clearly. 
 Also the ToC looks very scrambled (I know this hasn't changed). At a glance it's not obvious what the horizontal rules are separating. And having the larger headings share lines just looks awkward, especially when it means the headings with subsections get a single line while the ones without will share a line. 
 On a positive note the individual entries are very clear and look much better. The champion entries aren't cluttered anymore, nor are their abilities. Definitely an upgrade here IMO.

    any way to rewatch a game if i dont have lolreplay or anything like that? 
   
   If your computer can handle it you can use streaming software to record it. I use http://obsproject.com/ 
 to stream and analyze my games. You don't have to actually stream your games if you don't want, so if you just want to record a movie it'll do that. It's just a movie though, so you can't control the camera.

   Unfortunately as these games are basically just tests I don't think I'll be going back to make edits. That being said I definitely appreciate feedback and I'll take it into consideration in the future. 
 Also, I'm not an artist as you can probably tell ^_^ All of the art was done in MS Paint and made transparent/animated in GIMP. To put it in perspective the Nid game took me about 3 hours to make, 2 hours of which was spent doing &quot;art.&quot; Teemo Hunt took about 5 or 6 hours, at least 3 of which was spent on art.

    A New Talon Passive 
   
   2/3/4 are just numbers. It could just as easily be 1/1.5/2. 
 Also Talon's bleed DPS is very low, and it's pretty common to get out of his ultimate if Talon wants to use the stealth duration before reactivating it. You can be forced to not get the full 2.5 second stealth out of your ult. Not only that, but contracting your ult telegraphs exactly where you went. Giving him a small window to keep moving would let him R &amp;gt; R sooner without adding any extra power to his kit.

    Let's talk about Hawkshot 
   
   She needs to be in rework territory, but I was keeping this related to Hawkshot. I'd be fine taking away the gold passive and giving her a mana regen passive. Then lower the base damage on her ult and give her a steroid for her actual passive. 
 See this for a lot of existing Ashe discussion.

    Let's talk about Hawkshot 
   
   I'm not a fan of giving it true sight and making her niche, but I do have a suggestion I've tossed out before (copy pasta inc): 
 Give Hawkshot 1/2/3/4/5 mana regen per 5 for 10 seconds upon killing a unit in addition to its current passive. Ashe now has a reason to level it up earlier because she can have more mana in lane. More mana in lane means more volleys. More volleys means a stronger lane.
