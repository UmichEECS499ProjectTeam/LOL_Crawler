Champions
generally
fall
into
certain
categories
based
on
their
skills.
These
are
also

and
are
used
on
the
attributes

on
each

main
page

page.

Categories
Standard
tags
Those
categories
are
copied
exactly
from
the
game
client,
and
will
be
listed
on
each
champion
normal
page.
Note
that
some
champions
are
capable
of
more
than
just
the
role
or
roles
they
are
listed
under.
A
champion's
abilities,
items
they
gain
throughout
the
game,
and
one's
ability
to
fulfill
that
duty
determine
what
role
they
assume
in
gameplay.
As
of
V3.10
,
tags
for
secondary
attributes
are
no
longer
visible
in
the
game
client,
but
have
been
retained
here
for
information
purposes.
Primary
Attributes
Assassin
:
Champions
with
mediocre
auto-attacks
and
defense,
who
specialize
in
killing
their
enemies
quickly.
These
champions
usually
are
physical
attackers
and
are
DPS-based
(Damage
per
second)
or
are
AP
(ability
power)
burst
oriented.
Many
of
them
have
some
form
of
invisibility
or
blinking
ability
which
lets
them
choose
the
right
moment
to
step
in
or
out
of
a
fight.
They
should
focus
on
items
that
will
increase
the
damage
they
put
out
over
a
short
period
of
time.
In
fights,
they
play
a
role
as
sneak
attackers
of
key
targets
(like
the
marksman
or
the
mage),
who
pick
off
weak
enemies
and
carry
champions
at
the
right
time.
They
should
not
be
played
for
frontal
engagements
in
team
fights
since
they
lack
good
defense
compared
to
fighters
and
tanks.
Assassins
focus
on
timing
and
positioning,
rather
than
brute
strength
or
defense,
to
ensure
their
kills.
Assassins
usually
kill
marksmen,
supports,
and
most
mages
with
ease,
but
perform
worse
against
fighters
and
tanks.
Fighter
(also
known
as
Bruiser
or
Off-tank
):
Champions
that
blend
the
attributes
of
a
damager
and
tank,
combining
moderate
to
heavy
survivability
with
a
portion
of
the
damage
of
an
assassin
or
marksman
(essentially
half
tank,
half
DPS).
They
lack
the
front-loaded,
destructive
damage
of
their
pure
DPS
counterparts,
but
usually
have
abilities
which
increase
their
damage
output
or
abilities
with
high
damage
bases,
making
them
deadlier
in
the
early
game.
Fighters
can
build
to
be
extremely
survivable,
but
the
key
distinction
between
tanky
fighters
and
true
tanks
is
that
tanks
are
designed
to
draw
damage
and
disrupt
enemies,
while
fighters
deal
damage.
In
a
team
fight,
fighter
champions
can
surrogate
the
role
of
a
tank
or
assassin,
and
many
have
powerful
fight-initiation
abilities.
With
their
special
blend
of
defense,
damage,
and
mobility,
fighters
can
pierce
through
enemy
lines
to
reach
and
destroy
squishier
targets
while
withstanding
moderate
damage.
Fighters
can
usually
take
1v1
almost
any
other
role,
however
their
weakness
is
that
they
can't
dish
out
damage
as
reliably
as
a
marksman
or
as
quickly
as
a
mage
or
help
as
support;
usually,
their
role
in
late-game
is
more
to
defend
or
back
up
the
primary
damage
dealers
in
a
team
fight.
Most
fighters
fall
off
in
late
game
due
to
their
abilities
having
low
scaling
ratios
(but
very
high
bases).
Mage
:
(also
known
as
APC
:
Ability
Power
Carry
)
Mostly
ranged
champions
with
powerful
magic
damage
skills,
good
crowd
control
or
a
combination
of
both,
but
low
defense
and
weak
auto-attacks.
Some
are
meant
to
deal
a
high
amount
of
damage
in
a
short
period
of
time
(burst
casters/burst
mages)
while
others
usually
deal
damage
over
time;
however,
even
DoT
mages
tend
to
have
at
least
one
nuke.
Most
mages
present
the
user
with
a
flexible,
versatile,
and
powerful
skillset.
Like
marksman
champions,
they
can
bring
their
team
to
victory
due
to
their
ability
power
,
but
burst
based
mages
tend
to
fall
of
a
bit
at
late
game.
They
require
tanky
teammates
for
protection
since
they
lack
high
durability
as
they
are
capable
of
dishing
out
tremendous
damage
to
the
enemy
team
with
their
abilities.
Otherwise,
enemy
teams
can
easily
pick
them
off,
especially
since
few
mages
have
outstanding
mobility.
Mage
champions
easily
kill
marksmen,
other
mages
and
supports
(assasins
too,
but
they
have
to
get
caught
out
of
position
or
by
surprise),
and
a
few
mages
with
supreme
bursts
can
even
kill
fighters
1v1,
however,
the
large
majority
of
mages
can't
hit
hard
enough
to
kill
a
fighter
and
those
who
can
have
to
channel
a
combo(
Malzahar
)
or
take
a
while
to
fully
execute
their
skills
(
Syndra
,
Xerath
)
Some
mages
work
more
like
marksmen,
having
high
sustained
damage
rather
than
the
&quot;burst&quot;,
normally
associated
with
mages;
this
trait
allows
them
to
take
on
tanks
and
fighters
more
effectively,
though
mages
with
this
trait
are
less
effective
against
quick
damage
dealers
like
assassins.
Some
mages
have
abilities
with
high
base
damage,
and
if
they
are
doing
well,
they
can
get
somewhat
tankier
or
supportive
without
sacrificing
much
damage.
Range
between
mages
is
very
defining;
low
ranged
mages
have
to
build
tanky
ability
power
items,
otherwise
they
would
die
as
soon
as
they
enter
their
damage
range.
The
short
range
comes
with
rewards
however,
higher-than
usual
damage
(either
sustained
or
up-front
but
extremely
high)
(
Cassiopeia
,
Swain
,
LeBlanc
,
or
Vladimir
),
outstanding
crowd
control
(
Lissandra
)
or
naturally
increased
tankyness
and
survivality
(
Swain
,
or
Vladimir
).
The
long
ranged
ones
on
the
other
hand,
can
freely
build
&quot;glass
cannon&quot;
as
they
have
either
extremely
long
range
(
Xerath
)
or
are
very
hard
to
catch
or
kill
(
Lux
,
or
Nidalee
).
Marksman
:
(also
Known
as
ADC
:
Attack
Damage
Carry
or
just
Carry
)
Champions
with
high
auto-attack
damage,
usually
long
range,
but
low
defense.
Most
marksmen
have
skills,
passive
or
active,
that
scales
with
their
stats,
such
as
an
increase
in
Base
Damage
and
Attack
Speed
or
allowing
them
to
keep
themself
safe,
and
rely
on
their
auto-attack
to
dish
out
damage.
Marksman
champions
are
extremely
effective
late-game
at
&quot;carrying&quot;
the
team
to
victory,
either
by
killing
off
key
players
on
the
enemy
team
or
dealing
large
damage
in
team
fights
because
they
have
tremendous
damage
output,
but
low
defense.
Due
to
this,
they
are
key
champions
and
are
primary
targets
for
enemy
team
.
As
a
result,
they
require
tanky
teammates
like
fighters
and
tanks
for
protection
as
they
lack
survivability.
Some
marksmen
function
more
like
ranged
AD
casters
that
are
more
dependent
on
casting
skills
that
deal
high
amounts
of
burst
damage
than
autoattacking
(
Ezreal
,
Miss
Fortune
,
and
Graves
).
Other
marksmen
are
more
reliant
on
autoattacking
and
more
focused
on
building
attack
speed
,
Critical
chance,
items
that
boosts
their
autoattacks
(i.e.
Blade
of
the
Ruined
King
),
and
life
steal
instead
for
damage
per
second
(
Tristana
,
Vayne
,
and
Kog'Maw
)
Marksmen
can
only
usually
beat
supports
and
tanks
1v1
but
kill
everything
if
they
are
protected.
Due
to
their
low
health
marksmen
are
almost
always
beaten
by
the
high
burst
that
Mages
output.
Due
to
(most)
marksmen
not
being
all
too
reliant
on
abilities,
rather
using
autoattacks
to
deal
damage,
they
are
capable
of
dealing
a
lot
of
damage
over
a
longer
period
of
time
compared
to
mages.
Support
:
Champions
whose
skills
are
meant
to
directly
aid
the
rest
of
the
team.
They
can
either
babysit
a
champion
to
make
laning
easier
for
them
by
providing
healing,
buffing
allies,
applying
debuffs
to
the
enemy
team,
or
a
combination
of
the
above.
The
most
common
ability
for
a
support
champion
is
providing
an
ally
with
a
shield
of
some
kind
or
annoying
the
enemy
with
some
form
of
strong
crowd
control.
One
of
the
main
goals
of
a
support
is
to
let
their
lane
partner
farm
minions
for
gold,
as
supports
can
buy
key
gold+
items
to
get
gold
for
themselves,
as
well
as
controlling
the
map
with
wards,
warding
all
key
areas
of
the
map.
These
champions
usually
rely
on
their
skills
more
than
their
auto-attack.
Supports
can't
really
kill
anything
but
other
supports
on
their
own,
but
their
buffs
and
harsh
CC
makes
them
deadly
when
paired
along
with
any
other
role
but
tanks.
A
few
supports
have
ability
power
ratios
high
enough
to
let
them
become
mages,
and
a
few
mages
have
supportive
abilities/aggressive
crowd
control
which
lets
them
become
supports.
Supports
can
often
use
their
CC
to
interrupt
assassins
and
protect
nearby
mages
and
marksmen.
Tank
:
Champions
with
extremely
high
defense,
health,
and
crowd
control
abilities,
but
low
attack
damage
or
poor
ability
power
scaling.
Tanks
are
usually
champions
that
combine
high
amounts
of
health,
armor,
and
magic
resistance.
If
left
alone,
tanks
are
able
to
absorb
high
amounts
of
damage
or
create
disables
on
their
foes,
which
make
them
great
harassers
as
well.
In
battle,
this
type
of
champion
is
usually
expected
to
start/initiate
(or
at
least
be
in
the
front
of)
the
team
fight
;
soaking
up
damage,
and
helping
focus
certain
enemies
(marksman
and
mage
champions).
Due
to
their
low
damage
output,
they
must
rely
on
their
assassin,
marksman,
fighter,
and
mage
champions
to
finish
the
enemy
off
or
chase
them
down
when
they
initially
weakened
them.
As
a
result,
tanks
are
not
expected
to
gain
high
kills
but
more
assists.
Tank
champions
should
coordinate
team
fights
by
telling
the
team
to
retreat
or
advance
when
necessary
since
they
lead
the
charge.
They
are
also
meant
to
be
a
protector
of
the
team,
and
must
be
willing
to
sacrifice
themselves
for
vulnerable
allies
if
necessary.
Tanks
can
usually
kill
mages,
as
a
mage's
full
burst
will
rarely
take
the
tank
below
50%
health,
and
are
left
open
for
the
tank's
slow,
steady
damage
output;
however,
DoT
mages
might
be
harder
to
deal
with.
Some
tanks
have
very
high
ratios
on
their
abilities
and
if
they
are
doing
well
enough
they
can
leave
a
bit
their
tankiness
to
get
damage.
In
a
manner
similar
to
many
supports,
most
tanks
can
use
CC
to
interrupt
assasins,
but
they
can
also
use
them
to
lock
down
mages
or
marksmen
using
their
defenses
to
be
able
to
safely
position
themselves
within
the
enemy
lines.
Secondary
Attributes
Jungler
:
Champions
that
can
easily
farm
monsters
in
the
jungle
at
an
early
stage
in
the
game
and
can
typically
take
out
minions
waves
quickly.
They
usually
excel
at
taking
down
opponents
when
they
can
catch
them
off
guard
in
lane.
Some
champions
jungle
because
their
lane
phase
isn't
that
strong
(easily
harassed,
high
mana
dependency
early
on)
and
others
are
capable
of
both.
Many
fighters,
assassins
and
tanks
can
take
the
role
of
jungler;
though
it
is
generally
expected
that
the
champion
will
have
some
form
of
self
sustain
.
Melee
:
Champions
that
have
a
melee
basic
attack,
so
they
have
to
be
very
close
to
their
target
in
order
to
do
damage.
They
usually
have
more
health,
armor
and
magic
resistance
than
ranged
champions
as
well
as
heals.
Most
tanks
and
fighters
are
melee
combatants,
although
melee
mages
are
not
uncommon.
Pusher
:
Champions
that
can
quickly
kill
minion
waves
or
destroy
turrets
in
a
short
amount
of
time.
Typically,
pusher
champions
have
pets,
AoE
abilities,
or
a
high
amount
of
attack
speed.
Ranged
:
Champions
whose
basic
attack
can
cause
damage
at
a
distance
(see
range
),
allowing
them
to
avoid
many
harmful
risks
and
increasing
their
flee
capability.
Ranged
Champions
are
divided
into
two
sub-categories:
Mage
and
Marksmen
champions.
Mages
have
a
weak
auto-attack
and
focus
on
high
damage
spells
or
support,
while
marksmen
tend
to
focus
more
on
frequent,
powerful
auto-attacks.
Recommended
:
Champions
whose
skills
don't
involve
any
complicated
mechanics
and
playing
them
effectively
does
not
require
extensive
knowledge
of
the
other
champions.
They
are
all
1350
or
lower,
with
the
exception
of
Sona
,
Rammus
and
Katarina
,
who
cost
3150
.
There
is
usually
at
least
1
recommended
champion
every
free
week.
Stealth
:
Champions
that
possess
at
least
one
ability
that
allows
them
to
become
invisible
to
enemies
(other
than
when
near
turrets
and
vision
wards).
This
attribute
is
mainly
for
assassin
champions.

Note
that
some
champions
are
capable
of
more
than
just
the
role
or
roles
they
are
listed
under.
A
champion's
abilities,
items
they
gain
throughout
the
game,
and
one's
ability
to
fulfill
that
duty
determine
what
role
they
assume
in

As

are
no

the

but
have
been
retained
here
for
information
purposes.
Primary
Attributes
Assassin
:
Champions
with
mediocre
auto-attacks
and
defense,
who
specialize
in
killing
their
enemies
quickly.
These
champions
usually
are
physical
attackers
and
are
DPS-based
(Damage
per
second)
or
are
AP
(ability
power)
burst
oriented.
Many
of
them
have
some
form
of
invisibility
or
blinking
ability
which
lets
them
choose
the
right
moment
to
step
in
or
out
of
a
fight.
They
should
focus
on
items
that
will
increase
the
damage
they
put
out
over
a
short
period
of
time.
In
fights,
they
play
a
role
as
sneak
attackers
of
key
targets
(like
the
marksman
or
the
mage),
who
pick
off
weak
enemies
and
carry
champions
at
the
right
time.
They
should
not
be
played
for
frontal
engagements
in
team
fights
since
they
lack
good
defense
compared
to
fighters
and
tanks.
Assassins
focus
on
timing
and
positioning,
rather
than
brute
strength
or
defense,
to
ensure
their
kills.
Assassins
usually
kill
marksmen,
supports,
and
most
mages
with
ease,
but
perform
worse
against
fighters
and
tanks.
Fighter
(also
known
as
Bruiser
or
Off-tank
):
Champions
that
blend
the
attributes
of
a
damager
and
tank,
combining
moderate
to
heavy
survivability
with
a
portion
of
the
damage
of
an
assassin
or
marksman
(essentially
half
tank,
half
DPS).
They
lack
the
front-loaded,
destructive
damage
of
their
pure
DPS
counterparts,
but
usually
have
abilities
which
increase
their
damage
output
or
abilities
with
high
damage
bases,
making
them
deadlier
in
the
early
game.
Fighters
can
build
to
be
extremely
survivable,
but
the
key
distinction
between
tanky
fighters
and
true
tanks
is
that
tanks
are
designed
to
draw
damage
and
disrupt
enemies,
while
fighters
deal
damage.
In
a
team
fight,
fighter
champions
can
surrogate
the
role
of
a
tank
or
assassin,
and
many
have
powerful
fight-initiation
abilities.
With
their
special
blend
of
defense,
damage,
and
mobility,
fighters
can
pierce
through
enemy
lines
to
reach
and
destroy
squishier
targets
while
withstanding
moderate
damage.
Fighters
can
usually
take
1v1
almost
any
other
role,
however
their
weakness
is
that
they
can't
dish
out
damage
as
reliably
as
a
marksman
or
as
quickly
as
a
mage
or
help
as
support;
usually,
their
role
in
late-game
is
more
to
defend
or
back
up
the
primary
damage
dealers
in
a
team
fight.
Most
fighters
fall
off
in
late
game
due
to
their
abilities
having
low
scaling
ratios
(but
very
high
bases).
Mage
:
(also
known
as
APC
:
Ability
Power
Carry
)
Mostly
ranged
champions
with
powerful
magic
damage
skills,
good
crowd
control
or
a
combination
of
both,
but
low
defense
and
weak
auto-attacks.
Some
are
meant
to
deal
a
high
amount
of
damage
in
a
short
period
of
time
(burst
casters/burst
mages)
while
others
usually
deal
damage
over
time;
however,
even
DoT
mages
tend
to
have
at
least
one
nuke.
Most
mages
present
the
user
with
a
flexible,
versatile,
and
powerful
skillset.
Like
marksman
champions,
they
can
bring
their
team
to
victory
due
to
their
ability
power
,
but
burst
based
mages
tend
to
fall
of
a
bit
at
late
game.
They
require
tanky
teammates
for
protection
since
they
lack
high
durability
as
they
are
capable
of
dishing
out
tremendous
damage
to
the
enemy
team
with
their
abilities.
Otherwise,
enemy
teams
can
easily
pick
them
off,
especially
since
few
mages
have
outstanding
mobility.
Mage
champions
easily
kill
marksmen,
other
mages
and
supports
(assasins
too,
but
they
have
to
get
caught
out
of
position
or
by
surprise),
and
a
few
mages
with
supreme
bursts
can
even
kill
fighters
1v1,
however,
the
large
majority
of
mages
can't
hit
hard
enough
to
kill
a
fighter
and
those
who
can
have
to
channel
a
combo(
Malzahar
)
or
take
a
while
to
fully
execute
their
skills
(
Syndra
,
Xerath
)
Some
mages
work
more
like
marksmen,
having
high
sustained
damage
rather
than
the
&quot;burst&quot;,
normally
associated
with
mages;
this
trait
allows
them
to
take
on
tanks
and
fighters
more
effectively,
though
mages
with
this
trait
are
less
effective
against
quick
damage
dealers
like
assassins.
Some
mages
have
abilities
with
high
base
damage,
and
if
they
are
doing
well,
they
can
get
somewhat
tankier
or
supportive
without
sacrificing
much
damage.
Range
between
mages
is
very
defining;
low
ranged
mages
have
to
build
tanky
ability
power
items,
otherwise
they
would
die
as
soon
as
they
enter
their
damage
range.
The
short
range
comes
with
rewards
however,
higher-than
usual
damage
(either
sustained
or
up-front
but
extremely
high)
(
Cassiopeia
,
Swain
,
LeBlanc
,
or
Vladimir
),
outstanding
crowd
control
(
Lissandra
)
or
naturally
increased
tankyness
and
survivality
(
Swain
,
or
Vladimir
).
The
long
ranged
ones
on
the
other
hand,
can
freely
build
&quot;glass
cannon&quot;
as
they
have
either
extremely
long
range
(
Xerath
)
or
are
very
hard
to
catch
or
kill
(
Lux
,
or
Nidalee
).
Marksman
:
(also
Known
as
ADC
:
Attack
Damage
Carry
or
just
Carry
)
Champions
with
high
auto-attack
damage,
usually
long
range,
but
low
defense.
Most
marksmen
have
skills,
passive
or
active,
that
scales
with
their
stats,
such
as
an
increase
in
Base
Damage
and
Attack
Speed
or
allowing
them
to
keep
themself
safe,
and
rely
on
their
auto-attack
to
dish
out
damage.
Marksman
champions
are
extremely
effective
late-game
at
&quot;carrying&quot;
the
team
to
victory,
either
by
killing
off
key
players
on
the
enemy
team
or
dealing
large
damage
in
team
fights
because
they
have
tremendous
damage
output,
but
low
defense.
Due
to
this,
they
are
key
champions
and
are
primary
targets
for
enemy
team
.
As
a
result,
they
require
tanky
teammates
like
fighters
and
tanks
for
protection
as
they
lack
survivability.
Some
marksmen
function
more
like
ranged
AD
casters
that
are
more
dependent
on
casting
skills
that
deal
high
amounts
of
burst
damage
than
autoattacking
(
Ezreal
,
Miss
Fortune
,
and
Graves
).
Other
marksmen
are
more
reliant
on
autoattacking
and
more
focused
on
building
attack
speed
,
Critical
chance,
items
that
boosts
their
autoattacks
(i.e.
Blade
of
the
Ruined
King
),
and
life
steal
instead
for
damage
per
second
(
Tristana
,
Vayne
,
and
Kog'Maw
)
Marksmen
can
only
usually
beat
supports
and
tanks
1v1
but
kill
everything
if
they
are
protected.
Due
to
their
low
health
marksmen
are
almost
always
beaten
by
the
high
burst
that
Mages
output.
Due
to
(most)
marksmen
not
being
all
too
reliant
on
abilities,
rather
using
autoattacks
to
deal
damage,
they
are
capable
of
dealing
a
lot
of
damage
over
a
longer
period
of
time
compared
to
mages.
Support
:
Champions
whose
skills
are
meant
to
directly
aid
the
rest
of
the
team.
They
can
either
babysit
a
champion
to
make
laning
easier
for
them
by
providing
healing,
buffing
allies,
applying
debuffs
to
the
enemy
team,
or
a
combination
of
the
above.
The
most
common
ability
for
a
support
champion
is
providing
an
ally
with
a
shield
of
some
kind
or
annoying
the
enemy
with
some
form
of
strong
crowd
control.
One
of
the
main
goals
of
a
support
is
to
let
their
lane
partner
farm
minions
for
gold,
as
supports
can
buy
key
gold+
items
to
get
gold
for
themselves,
as
well
as
controlling
the
map
with
wards,
warding
all
key
areas
of
the
map.
These
champions
usually
rely
on
their
skills
more
than
their
auto-attack.
Supports
can't
really
kill
anything
but
other
supports
on
their
own,
but
their
buffs
and
harsh
CC
makes
them
deadly
when
paired
along
with
any
other
role
but
tanks.
A
few
supports
have
ability
power
ratios
high
enough
to
let
them
become
mages,
and
a
few
mages
have
supportive
abilities/aggressive
crowd
control
which
lets
them
become
supports.
Supports
can
often
use
their
CC
to
interrupt
assassins
and
protect
nearby
mages
and
marksmen.
Tank
:
Champions
with
extremely
high
defense,
health,
and
crowd
control
abilities,
but
low
attack
damage
or
poor
ability
power
scaling.
Tanks
are
usually
champions
that
combine
high
amounts
of
health,
armor,
and
magic
resistance.
If
left
alone,
tanks
are
able
to
absorb
high
amounts
of
damage
or
create
disables
on
their
foes,
which
make
them
great
harassers
as
well.
In
battle,
this
type
of
champion
is
usually
expected
to
start/initiate
(or
at
least
be
in
the
front
of)
the
team
fight
;
soaking
up
damage,
and
helping
focus
certain
enemies
(marksman
and
mage
champions).
Due
to
their
low
damage
output,
they
must
rely
on
their
assassin,
marksman,
fighter,
and
mage
champions
to
finish
the
enemy
off
or
chase
them
down
when
they
initially
weakened
them.
As
a
result,
tanks
are
not
expected
to
gain
high
kills
but
more
assists.
Tank
champions
should
coordinate
team
fights
by
telling
the
team
to
retreat
or
advance
when
necessary
since
they
lead
the
charge.
They
are
also
meant
to
be
a
protector
of
the
team,
and
must
be
willing
to
sacrifice
themselves
for
vulnerable
allies
if
necessary.
Tanks
can
usually
kill
mages,
as
a
mage's
full
burst
will
rarely
take
the
tank
below
50%
health,
and
are
left
open
for
the
tank's
slow,
steady
damage
output;
however,
DoT
mages
might
be
harder
to
deal
with.
Some
tanks
have
very
high
ratios
on
their
abilities
and
if
they
are
doing
well
enough
they
can
leave
a
bit
their
tankiness
to
get
damage.
In
a
manner
similar
to
many
supports,
most
tanks
can
use
CC
to
interrupt
assasins,
but
they
can
also
use
them
to
lock
down
mages
or
marksmen
using
their
defenses
to
be
able
to
safely
position
themselves
within
the
enemy
lines.
Secondary
Attributes
Jungler
:
Champions
that
can
easily
farm
monsters
in
the
jungle
at
an
early
stage
in
the
game
and
can
typically
take
out
minions
waves
quickly.
They
usually
excel
at
taking
down
opponents
when
they
can
catch
them
off
guard
in
lane.
Some
champions
jungle
because
their
lane
phase
isn't
that
strong
(easily
harassed,
high
mana
dependency
early
on)
and
others
are
capable
of
both.
Many
fighters,
assassins
and
tanks
can
take
the
role
of
jungler;
though
it
is
generally
expected
that
the
champion
will
have
some
form
of
self
sustain
.
Melee
:
Champions
that
have
a
melee
basic
attack,
so
they
have
to
be
very
close
to
their
target
in
order
to
do
damage.
They
usually
have
more
health,
armor
and
magic
resistance
than
ranged
champions
as
well
as
heals.
Most
tanks
and
fighters
are
melee
combatants,
although
melee
mages
are
not
uncommon.
Pusher
:
Champions
that
can
quickly
kill
minion
waves
or
destroy
turrets
in
a
short
amount
of
time.
Typically,
pusher
champions
have
pets,
AoE
abilities,
or
a
high
amount
of
attack
speed.
Ranged
:
Champions
whose
basic
attack
can
cause
damage
at
a
distance
(see
range
),
allowing
them
to
avoid
many
harmful
risks
and
increasing
their
flee
capability.
Ranged
Champions
are
divided
into
two
sub-categories:
Mage
and
Marksmen
champions.
Mages
have
a
weak
auto-attack
and
focus
on
high
damage
spells
or
support,
while
marksmen
tend
to
focus
more
on
frequent,
powerful
auto-attacks.
Recommended
:
Champions
whose
skills
don't
involve
any
complicated
mechanics
and
playing
them
effectively
does
not
require
extensive
knowledge
of
the
other
champions.
They
are
all
1350
or
lower,
with
the
exception
of
Sona
,
Rammus
and
Katarina
,
who
cost
3150
.
There
is
usually
at
least
1
recommended
champion
every
free
week.
Stealth
:
Champions
that
possess
at
least
one
ability
that
allows
them
to
become
invisible
to
enemies
(other
than
when
near
turrets
and
vision
wards).
This
attribute
is
mainly
for
assassin
champions.

Champions
generally

Those
categories
are
copied
exactly
from
the
game
client,
and
will
be
listed
on
each
champion
normal
page.
Note
that
some
champions
are
capable
of
more
than
just
the
role
or
roles
they
are
listed
under.
A
champion's
abilities,
items
they
gain
throughout
the
game,
and
one's
ability
to
fulfill
that
duty
determine
what
role
they
assume
in
gameplay.
As
of
V3.10
,
tags
for
secondary
attributes
are
no
longer
visible
in
the
game
client,
but
have
been
retained
here
for
information
purposes.
Primary
Attributes
Assassin
:
Champions
with
mediocre
auto-attacks
and
defense,
who
specialize
in
killing
their
enemies
quickly.
These
champions
usually
are
physical
attackers
and
are
DPS-based
(Damage
per
second)
or
are
AP
(ability
power)
burst
oriented.
Many
of
them
have
some
form
of
invisibility
or
blinking
ability
which
lets
them
choose
the
right
moment
to
step
in
or
out
of
a
fight.
They
should
focus
on
items
that
will
increase
the
damage
they
put
out
over
a
short
period
of
time.
In
fights,
they
play
a
role
as
sneak
attackers
of
key
targets
(like
the
marksman
or
the
mage),
who
pick
off
weak
enemies
and
carry
champions
at
the
right
time.
They
should
not
be
played
for
frontal
engagements
in
team
fights
since
they
lack
good
defense
compared
to
fighters
and
tanks.
Assassins
focus
on
timing
and
positioning,
rather
than
brute
strength
or
defense,
to
ensure
their
kills.
Assassins
usually
kill
marksmen,
supports,
and
most
mages
with
ease,
but
perform
worse
against
fighters
and
tanks.
Fighter
(also
known
as
Bruiser
or
Off-tank
):
Champions
that
blend
the
attributes
of
a
damager
and
tank,
combining
moderate
to
heavy
survivability
with
a
portion
of
the
damage
of
an
assassin
or
marksman
(essentially
half
tank,
half
DPS).
They
lack
the
front-loaded,
destructive
damage
of
their
pure
DPS
counterparts,
but
usually
have
abilities
which
increase
their
damage
output
or
abilities
with
high
damage
bases,
making
them
deadlier
in
the
early
game.
Fighters
can
build
to
be
extremely
survivable,
but
the
key
distinction
between
tanky
fighters
and
true
tanks
is
that
tanks
are
designed
to
draw
damage
and
disrupt
enemies,
while
fighters
deal
damage.
In
a
team
fight,
fighter
champions
can
surrogate
the
role
of
a
tank
or
assassin,
and
many
have
powerful
fight-initiation
abilities.
With
their
special
blend
of
defense,
damage,
and
mobility,
fighters
can
pierce
through
enemy
lines
to
reach
and
destroy
squishier
targets
while
withstanding
moderate
damage.
Fighters
can
usually
take
1v1
almost
any
other
role,
however
their
weakness
is
that
they
can't
dish
out
damage
as
reliably
as
a
marksman
or
as
quickly
as
a
mage
or
help
as
support;
usually,
their
role
in
late-game
is
more
to
defend
or
back
up
the
primary
damage
dealers
in
a
team
fight.
Most
fighters
fall
off
in
late
game
due
to
their
abilities
having
low
scaling
ratios
(but
very
high
bases).
Mage
:
(also
known
as
APC
:
Ability
Power
Carry
)
Mostly
ranged
champions
with
powerful
magic
damage
skills,
good
crowd
control
or
a
combination
of
both,
but
low
defense
and
weak
auto-attacks.
Some
are
meant
to
deal
a
high
amount
of
damage
in
a
short
period
of
time
(burst
casters/burst
mages)
while
others
usually
deal
damage
over
time;
however,
even
DoT
mages
tend
to
have
at
least
one
nuke.
Most
mages
present
the
user
with
a
flexible,
versatile,
and
powerful
skillset.
Like
marksman
champions,
they
can
bring
their
team
to
victory
due
to
their
ability
power
,
but
burst
based
mages
tend
to
fall
of
a
bit
at
late
game.
They
require
tanky
teammates
for
protection
since
they
lack
high
durability
as
they
are
capable
of
dishing
out
tremendous
damage
to
the
enemy
team
with
their
abilities.
Otherwise,
enemy
teams
can
easily
pick
them
off,
especially
since
few
mages
have
outstanding
mobility.
Mage
champions
easily
kill
marksmen,
other
mages
and
supports
(assasins
too,
but
they
have
to
get
caught
out
of
position
or
by
surprise),
and
a
few
mages
with
supreme
bursts
can
even
kill
fighters
1v1,
however,
the
large
majority
of
mages
can't
hit
hard
enough
to
kill
a
fighter
and
those
who
can
have
to
channel
a
combo(
Malzahar
)
or
take
a
while
to
fully
execute
their
skills
(
Syndra
,
Xerath
)
Some
mages
work
more
like
marksmen,
having
high
sustained
damage
rather
than
the
&quot;burst&quot;,
normally
associated
with
mages;
this
trait
allows
them
to
take
on
tanks
and
fighters
more
effectively,
though
mages
with
this
trait
are
less
effective
against
quick
damage
dealers
like
assassins.
Some
mages
have
abilities
with
high
base
damage,
and
if
they
are
doing
well,
they
can
get
somewhat
tankier
or
supportive
without
sacrificing
much
damage.
Range
between
mages
is
very
defining;
low
ranged
mages
have
to
build
tanky
ability
power
items,
otherwise
they
would
die
as
soon
as
they
enter
their
damage
range.
The
short
range
comes
with
rewards
however,
higher-than
usual
damage
(either
sustained
or
up-front
but
extremely
high)
(
Cassiopeia
,
Swain
,
LeBlanc
,
or
Vladimir
),
outstanding
crowd
control
(
Lissandra
)
or
naturally
increased
tankyness
and
survivality
(
Swain
,
or
Vladimir
).
The
long
ranged
ones
on
the
other
hand,
can
freely
build
&quot;glass
cannon&quot;
as
they
have
either
extremely
long
range
(
Xerath
)
or
are
very
hard
to
catch
or
kill
(
Lux
,
or
Nidalee
).
Marksman
:
(also
Known
as
ADC
:
Attack
Damage
Carry
or
just
Carry
)
Champions
with
high
auto-attack
damage,
usually
long
range,
but
low
defense.
Most
marksmen
have
skills,
passive
or
active,
that
scales
with
their
stats,
such
as
an
increase
in
Base
Damage
and
Attack
Speed
or
allowing
them
to
keep
themself
safe,
and
rely
on
their
auto-attack
to
dish
out
damage.
Marksman
champions
are
extremely
effective
late-game
at
&quot;carrying&quot;
the
team
to
victory,
either
by
killing
off
key
players
on
the
enemy
team
or
dealing
large
damage
in
team
fights
because
they
have
tremendous
damage
output,
but
low
defense.
Due
to
this,
they
are
key
champions
and
are
primary
targets
for
enemy
team
.
As
a
result,
they
require
tanky
teammates
like
fighters
and
tanks
for
protection
as
they
lack
survivability.
Some
marksmen
function
more
like
ranged
AD
casters
that
are
more
dependent
on
casting
skills
that
deal
high
amounts
of
burst
damage
than
autoattacking
(
Ezreal
,
Miss
Fortune
,
and
Graves
).
Other
marksmen
are
more
reliant
on
autoattacking
and
more
focused
on
building
attack
speed
,
Critical
chance,
items
that
boosts
their
autoattacks
(i.e.
Blade
of
the
Ruined
King
),
and
life
steal
instead
for
damage
per
second
(
Tristana
,
Vayne
,
and
Kog'Maw
)
Marksmen
can
only
usually
beat
supports
and
tanks
1v1
but
kill
everything
if
they
are
protected.
Due
to
their
low
health
marksmen
are
almost
always
beaten
by
the
high
burst
that
Mages
output.
Due
to
(most)
marksmen
not
being
all
too
reliant
on
abilities,
rather
using
autoattacks
to
deal
damage,
they
are
capable
of
dealing
a
lot
of
damage
over
a
longer
period
of
time
compared
to
mages.
Support
:
Champions
whose
skills
are
meant
to
directly
aid
the
rest
of
the
team.
They
can
either
babysit
a
champion
to
make
laning
easier
for
them
by
providing
healing,
buffing
allies,
applying
debuffs
to
the
enemy
team,
or
a
combination
of
the
above.
The
most
common
ability
for
a
support
champion
is
providing
an
ally
with
a
shield
of
some
kind
or
annoying
the
enemy
with
some
form
of
strong
crowd
control.
One
of
the
main
goals
of
a
support
is
to
let
their
lane
partner
farm
minions
for
gold,
as
supports
can
buy
key
gold+
items
to
get
gold
for
themselves,
as
well
as
controlling
the
map
with
wards,
warding
all
key
areas
of
the
map.
These
champions
usually
rely
on
their
skills
more
than
their
auto-attack.
Supports
can't
really
kill
anything
but
other
supports
on
their
own,
but
their
buffs
and
harsh
CC
makes
them
deadly
when
paired
along
with
any
other
role
but
tanks.
A
few
supports
have
ability
power
ratios
high
enough
to
let
them
become
mages,
and
a
few
mages
have
supportive
abilities/aggressive
crowd
control
which
lets
them
become
supports.
Supports
can
often
use
their
CC
to
interrupt
assassins
and
protect
nearby
mages
and
marksmen.
Tank
:
Champions
with
extremely
high
defense,
health,
and
crowd
control
abilities,
but
low
attack
damage
or
poor
ability
power
scaling.
Tanks
are
usually
champions
that
combine
high
amounts
of
health,
armor,
and
magic
resistance.
If
left
alone,
tanks
are
able
to
absorb
high
amounts
of
damage
or
create
disables
on
their
foes,
which
make
them
great
harassers
as
well.
In
battle,
this
type
of
champion
is
usually
expected
to
start/initiate
(or
at
least
be
in
the
front
of)
the
team
fight
;
soaking
up
damage,
and
helping
focus
certain
enemies
(marksman
and
mage
champions).
Due
to
their
low
damage
output,
they
must
rely
on
their
assassin,
marksman,
fighter,
and
mage
champions
to
finish
the
enemy
off
or
chase
them
down
when
they
initially
weakened
them.
As
a
result,
tanks
are
not
expected
to
gain
high
kills
but
more
assists.
Tank
champions
should
coordinate
team
fights
by
telling
the
team
to
retreat
or
advance
when
necessary
since
they
lead
the
charge.
They
are
also
meant
to
be
a
protector
of
the
team,
and
must
be
willing
to
sacrifice
themselves
for
vulnerable
allies
if
necessary.
Tanks
can
usually
kill
mages,
as
a
mage's
full
burst
will
rarely
take
the
tank
below
50%
health,
and
are
left
open
for
the
tank's
slow,
steady
damage
output;
however,
DoT
mages
might
be
harder
to
deal
with.
Some
tanks
have
very
high
ratios
on
their
abilities
and
if
they
are
doing
well
enough
they
can
leave
a
bit
their
tankiness
to
get
damage.
In
a
manner
similar
to
many
supports,
most
tanks
can
use
CC
to
interrupt
assasins,
but
they
can
also
use
them
to
lock
down
mages
or
marksmen
using
their
defenses
to
be
able
to
safely
position
themselves
within
the
enemy
lines.
Secondary
Attributes
Jungler
:
Champions
that
can
easily
farm
monsters
in
the
jungle
at
an
early
stage
in
the
game
and
can
typically
take
out
minions
waves
quickly.
They
usually
excel
at
taking
down
opponents
when
they
can
catch
them
off
guard
in
lane.
Some
champions
jungle
because
their
lane
phase
isn't
that
strong
(easily
harassed,
high
mana
dependency
early
on)
and
others
are
capable
of
both.
Many
fighters,
assassins
and
tanks
can
take
the
role
of
jungler;
though
it
is
generally
expected
that
the
champion
will
have
some
form
of
self
sustain
.
Melee
:
Champions
that
have
a
melee
basic
attack,
so
they
have
to
be
very
close
to
their
target
in
order
to
do
damage.
They
usually
have
more
health,
armor
and
magic
resistance
than
ranged
champions
as
well
as
heals.
Most
tanks
and
fighters
are
melee
combatants,
although
melee
mages
are
not
uncommon.
Pusher
:
Champions
that
can
quickly
kill
minion
waves
or
destroy
turrets
in
a
short
amount
of
time.
Typically,
pusher
champions
have
pets,
AoE
abilities,
or
a
high
amount
of
attack
speed.
Ranged
:
Champions
whose
basic
attack
can
cause
damage
at
a
distance
(see
range
),
allowing
them
to
avoid
many
harmful
risks
and
increasing
their
flee
capability.
Ranged
Champions
are
divided
into
two
sub-categories:
Mage
and
Marksmen
champions.
Mages
have
a
weak
auto-attack
and
focus
on
high
damage
spells
or
support,
while
marksmen
tend
to
focus
more
on
frequent,
powerful
auto-attacks.
Recommended
:
Champions
whose
skills
don't
involve
any
complicated
mechanics
and
playing
them
effectively
does
not
require
extensive
knowledge
of
the
other
champions.
They
are
all
1350
or
lower,
with
the
exception
of
Sona
,
Rammus
and
Katarina
,
who
cost
3150
.
There
is
usually
at
least
1
recommended
champion
every
free
week.
Stealth
:
Champions
that
possess
at
least
one
ability
that
allows
them
to
become
invisible
to
enemies
(other
than
when
near
turrets
and
vision
wards).
This
attribute
is
mainly
for
assassin
champions.

Champion

Trivia
Skill
usage
Power
Chord
has
three
distinct
effects
based
on
Sona's
currently
active
aura.
Power
Chord
-
Staccato
will
deal
double
the
damage
of
Power
Chords
base
damage.
Charging
Power
Chord
three
times
with
Hymn
of
Valor
at
the
start
of
the
game
can
lead
to
an
advantage
fighting
in
the
brush
at
level
1.
(Use
Hymn
of
Valor
between
the
first
two
auto
attacks)
Power
Chord
-
Staccato
makes
Sona
a
good
early
game
harasser
.
Power
Chord
-
Diminuendo
will
apply
a
20%
damage
reduction
debuff
upon
a
target.
In
a
battle
using
Aria
of
Perseverance
along
with
Power
Chord
to
hit
the
enemy's
carry
can
help
turn
the
tides
of
the
fight.
Aria
of
Perseverance's
Power
Chord
also
affects
Dragon
.
Power
Chord
-
Tempo
will
apply
a
40%
slow
for
2
seconds.
Do
not
underestimate
the
movement
speed
buff
of
Song
of
Celerity
.
The
passive
aura
combined
with
its
AoE
active
can
give
a
very
large
speed
boost
to
Sona's
team.
This
combined
with
its
slow
from
Song
of
Celerity's
Power
Chord
can
make
it
very
difficult
to
catch/run
away
from
her
and
her
team.

Sona's
Hymn
of
Valor
is
very
strong
if
leveled
up
quickly.
However,
because
of
her
lack
of
escape
mechanisms
or
survivability
skills,
she
should
still
be
played
as
a
support
champion.
Leveling
first
is
great
for
aggressive
bot
lanes
due
to
Hymn
of
Valor's
passive
aura
granting
additional
AD
and
AP
as
well
as
providing
decent
harass
during
the
laning
phase.
In
a
passive
support
lane,
encourage
your
carry
to
trade
blows
with
the
opponent,
and
do
the
same
with
Hymn
of
Valor
and
Power
Chord
.
Afterwards,
heal
yourself
and
your
partner
with
Aria
of
Perseverance
.
This
will
wear
down
the
enemy
and
force
them
out
of
lane
in
less
time
and
mana
than
just
poking
with
Hymn
of
Valor
.
Use
Aria
of
Perseverance
when
an
ally
is
being
focused
in
order
to
take
advantage
of
the
bonus
armor
and
magic
resistance
.
Aria
of
Perseverance's
passive
aura
is
great
for
a
more
defensive
lane
and
also
for
team
fights
when
paired
with
Aegis
of
the
Legion
Stay
with
the
team.
Sona
makes
an
excellent
healer
,
Crescendo
is
best
used
when
the
whole
team
can
take
advantage
of
it,
and
Song
of
Celerity
lets
the
entire
team
kite.
Without
a
teammate
around,
Sona
is
little
more
than
an
easy
gank.
Early
game,
be
wary
of
constant
spell
rotation,
as
it
will
quickly
drain
her
mana.
However,
this
can
also
be
a
large
problem
mid
to
late
game
without
proper
itemization.
Crescendo
coupled
with
allies'
channeled
abilities
can
devastate
the
opposing
team,
as
while
stunned,
they
can't
interrupt
the
channel.
Build
usage
Being
a
support,
Sona
should
focus
on
supporting
her
AD
carry
early
game
by
warding
and
keeping
him/her
safe.
If
your
carry
can
get
last
hits,
you'll
want
to
leave
them
for
him/her.
You
can
offset
your
lack
of
farm
by
buying
Ancient
Coin
or
Spellthief's
Edge
for
more
sustain,
better
healing,
and
Gp10.
If
you
go
Sona
midlane,
you
usualy
need
to
keep
your
wards
up,
as
chance
to
escape
ganks,
when
not
warded,
is
limited,
and
basicaly
impossible
if
your
flash
is
down.
Getting
fast
Sheen
is
recomended,
as
well
as
getting
Chalice
of
Harmony
right
afterwards.
You
also
want
to
rotate
your
abilities,
in
order
to
have
2
stacks
of
your
passive
always
ready
to
punish
any
overextending
champion
with
Hymn
of
Valor
+
Sheen
+
Power
Chord
.
A
valuable
build
for
Sona
is
stacking
auras,
as
all
it
takes
is
Sona's
presence
for
her
to
be
useful
and
most
of
the
aura
items
you
should
be
getting
are
relatively
cheap.
The
combination
of
lvl
5
Hymn
of
Valor
and
Zeke's
Herald
gives
up
to
40
AD
and
10%
life
steal
to
her
close
allies.
The
combination
of
lvl
5
Aria
of
Perseverance
and
Aegis
of
the
Legion
gives
a
total
of
10
armor
and
30
MR
to
her
close
allies,
or
20
armor
and
40
MR
to
both
allies
while
Active.
Another
defensive
Aura
is
Frozen
Heart
.
Its
debuff
over
enemies
decreases
DPS
damage
output
of
enemy
team,
specially
from
enemy
AD
Carry.
It
can
be
used
in
combination
with
Power
Chord
-
Diminuendo
and
Exhaust
.
Other
offensive
Aura
is
Abyssal
Scepter
.
Its
debuff
over
enemies
increases
the
magic
damage
output
of
your
whole
team.
With
her
Song
of
Celerity
and
a
Talisman
of
Ascension
,
Sona
can
make
it
nearly
impossible
for
the
enemy
to
catch
a
dying
teammate
or
escape
from
her
team
during
a
chase.
These
two
things
also
allow
her
team
to
traverse
great
distances
very
quickly,
such
as
quickly
running
to
a
tower/inhibitor
after
an
ace
to
take
it
down
before
the
enemy
team
revives
or
moving
to
a
friendly
tower/inhib
to
prevent
it
from
being
taken.
All
of
Sona's
skills
(including
her
passive)
scale
with
AP
,
but
support
Sona
should
prioritize
cooldowns
over
AP
.
So
to
maximize
the
utility
of
her
skills,
passive
and
AoE
stun
of
Crescendo
Ionian
Boots
of
Lucidity
,
Fiendish
Codex
,
Athene's
Unholy
Grail
,
Banner
of
Command
,
Morellonomicon
,
Kindlegem
,
Zeke's
Herald
,
Locket
of
the
Iron
Solari
,
Frozen
Heart
and
Talisman
of
Ascension
are
good
options.
With
40%
cooldown
reduction
,
the
cooldown
of
Hymn
of
Valor
,
Aria
of
Perseverance
and
Song
of
Celerity
are
4,2
sec.
and
lvl
3
Crescendo
cooldown
is
60
sec.
As
midlaner,
on
the
other
hand,
AP
items
with
side
utility
should
be
prioritized,
while
getting
CDR
as
close
to
40%
as
possible.
Athene's
Unholy
Grail
is
a
must,
while
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
and
Liandry's
Torment
are
good
to
have
items
to
make
you
both
slightly
more
durable,
and
increase
power
of
your
poke.
Lich
Bane
,
another
useful
item,
is
however
ignored
by
some
in
order
to
achieve
higher
AP
and
therefore
stronger
teamfight
impact,
sacrifying
personal
power
for
stronger
supportive
power.
Sona
is
extremely
valuable
in
group
pushes,
but
sustained
aura
rotation
can
deplete
her
mana
pool
quickly
if
not
equipped
properly,
consider
mana
regeneration
glyphs
per
level
to
make
sure
she
never
runs
out
of
mana.
Because
Sona
has
generally
low
cooldowns
,
low
mana
costs,
and
needs
to
constantly
switch
abilities,
she
charges
up
Seraph's
Embrace
faster
than
almost
any
other
champion.
This
also
helps
her,
as
it
provides
one
of
the
highest
mana
regens
in
the
game,
allows
her
to
stay
in
long
team
pushes
for
much
longer,
and
gives
her
a
small
shield
for
incoming
burst.
Mejai's
Soulstealer
,
while
not
always
viable,
generally
charges
up
quickly
as
long
as
you
stay
safe.
As
long
as
she
has
an
aura
active,
Sona
gets
assists
for
simply
being
at
teamfights.
With
40%
Cooldown
Reduction,
Sona
can
keep
stacks
of
Guinsoo's
Rageblade
up
easily.
Lich
Bane
can
add
a
significant
amount
of
damage
to
her
autoattack.
Combined
with
Power
Chord
it
can
provide
decent
burst
damage.

Sona
is
fairly
squishy
throughout
the
game,
especially
at
level
1.
Work
with
your
allies
to
kill
her
fast.
When
laning
against
Sona
,
be
sure
to
play
safe
as
she
can
boost
her
partner
with
her
supporting
spells.
All
of
Sona
's
active
stances
are
AoE
,
meaning
that
you
can
avoid
her
spells
by
moving
away
from
her.
Do
not
overextend
when
chasing
an
enemy
that
is
accompanied
with
Sona
.
Her
Song
of
Celerity
allows
her
to
outrun
you
very
quickly.
During
teamfights
try
to
kill
Sona
first,
since
she
provides
consistent
damage/defense
boosting
auras
through
the
teamfight,
as
well
as
an
AoE
stun.

usage
Power
Chord
has
three
distinct
effects
based
on
Sona's
currently
active
aura.
Power
Chord
-
Staccato
will
deal
double
the
damage
of
Power
Chords
base
damage.
Charging
Power
Chord
three
times
with
Hymn
of
Valor
at
the
start
of
the
game
can
lead
to
an
advantage
fighting
in
the
brush
at
level
1.
(Use
Hymn
of
Valor
between
the
first
two
auto
attacks)
Power
Chord
-
Staccato
makes
Sona
a
good
early
game
harasser
.
Power
Chord
-
Diminuendo
will
apply
a
20%
damage
reduction
debuff
upon
a
target.
In
a
battle
using
Aria
of
Perseverance
along
with
Power
Chord
to
hit
the
enemy's
carry
can
help
turn
the
tides
of
the
fight.
Aria
of
Perseverance's
Power
Chord
also
affects
Dragon
.
Power
Chord
-
Tempo
will
apply
a
40%
slow
for
2
seconds.
Do
not
underestimate
the
movement
speed
buff
of
Song
of
Celerity
.
The
passive
aura
combined
with
its
AoE
active
can
give
a
very
large
speed
boost
to
Sona's
team.
This
combined
with
its
slow
from
Song
of
Celerity's
Power
Chord
can
make
it
very
difficult
to
catch/run
away
from
her
and
her
team.

Sona's
Hymn
of
Valor
is
very
strong
if
leveled
up
quickly.
However,
because
of
her
lack
of
escape
mechanisms
or
survivability
skills,
she
should
still
be
played
as
a
support
champion.
Leveling
first
is
great
for
aggressive
bot
lanes
due
to
Hymn
of
Valor's
passive
aura
granting
additional
AD
and
AP
as
well
as
providing
decent
harass
during
the
laning
phase.
In
a
passive
support
lane,
encourage
your
carry
to
trade
blows
with
the
opponent,
and
do
the
same
with
Hymn
of
Valor
and
Power
Chord
.
Afterwards,
heal
yourself
and
your
partner
with
Aria
of
Perseverance
.
This
will
wear
down
the
enemy
and
force
them
out
of
lane
in
less
time
and
mana
than
just
poking
with
Hymn
of
Valor
.
Use
Aria
of
Perseverance
when
an
ally
is
being
focused
in
order
to
take
advantage
of
the
bonus
armor
and
magic
resistance
.
Aria
of
Perseverance's
passive
aura
is
great
for
a
more
defensive
lane
and
also
for
team
fights
when
paired
with
Aegis
of
the
Legion
Stay
with
the
team.
Sona
makes
an
excellent
healer
,
Crescendo
is
best
used
when
the
whole
team
can
take
advantage
of
it,
and
Song
of
Celerity
lets
the
entire
team
kite.
Without
a
teammate
around,
Sona
is
little
more
than
an
easy
gank.
Early
game,
be
wary
of
constant
spell
rotation,
as
it
will
quickly
drain
her
mana.
However,
this
can
also
be
a
large
problem
mid
to
late
game
without
proper
itemization.
Crescendo
coupled
with
allies'
channeled
abilities
can
devastate
the
opposing
team,
as
while
stunned,
they
can't
interrupt
the
channel.
Build
usage
Being
a
support,
Sona
should
focus
on
supporting
her
AD
carry
early
game
by
warding
and
keeping
him/her
safe.
If
your
carry
can
get
last
hits,
you'll
want
to
leave
them
for
him/her.
You
can
offset
your
lack
of
farm
by
buying
Ancient
Coin
or
Spellthief's
Edge
for
more
sustain,
better
healing,
and
Gp10.
If
you
go
Sona
midlane,
you
usualy
need
to
keep
your
wards
up,
as
chance
to
escape
ganks,
when
not
warded,
is
limited,
and
basicaly
impossible
if
your
flash
is
down.
Getting
fast
Sheen
is
recomended,
as
well
as
getting
Chalice
of
Harmony
right
afterwards.
You
also
want
to
rotate
your
abilities,
in
order
to
have
2
stacks
of
your
passive
always
ready
to
punish
any
overextending
champion
with
Hymn
of
Valor
+
Sheen
+
Power
Chord
.
A
valuable
build
for
Sona
is
stacking
auras,
as
all
it
takes
is
Sona's
presence
for
her
to
be
useful
and
most
of
the
aura
items
you
should
be
getting
are
relatively
cheap.
The
combination
of
lvl
5
Hymn
of
Valor
and
Zeke's
Herald
gives
up
to
40
AD
and
10%
life
steal
to
her
close
allies.
The
combination
of
lvl
5
Aria
of
Perseverance
and
Aegis
of
the
Legion
gives
a
total
of
10
armor
and
30
MR
to
her
close
allies,
or
20
armor
and
40
MR
to
both
allies
while
Active.
Another
defensive
Aura
is
Frozen
Heart
.
Its
debuff
over
enemies
decreases
DPS
damage
output
of
enemy
team,
specially
from
enemy
AD
Carry.
It
can
be
used
in
combination
with
Power
Chord
-
Diminuendo
and
Exhaust
.
Other
offensive
Aura
is
Abyssal
Scepter
.
Its
debuff
over
enemies
increases
the
magic
damage
output
of
your
whole
team.
With
her
Song
of
Celerity
and
a
Talisman
of
Ascension
,
Sona
can
make
it
nearly
impossible
for
the
enemy
to
catch
a
dying
teammate
or
escape
from
her
team
during
a
chase.
These
two
things
also
allow
her
team
to
traverse
great
distances
very
quickly,
such
as
quickly
running
to
a
tower/inhibitor
after
an
ace
to
take
it
down
before
the
enemy
team
revives
or
moving
to
a
friendly
tower/inhib
to
prevent
it
from
being
taken.
All
of
Sona's
skills
(including
her
passive)
scale
with
AP
,
but
support
Sona
should
prioritize
cooldowns
over
AP
.
So
to
maximize
the
utility
of
her
skills,
passive
and
AoE
stun
of
Crescendo
Ionian
Boots
of
Lucidity
,
Fiendish
Codex
,
Athene's
Unholy
Grail
,
Banner
of
Command
,
Morellonomicon
,
Kindlegem
,
Zeke's
Herald
,
Locket
of
the
Iron
Solari
,
Frozen
Heart
and
Talisman
of
Ascension
are
good
options.
With
40%
cooldown
reduction
,
the
cooldown
of
Hymn
of
Valor
,
Aria
of
Perseverance
and
Song
of
Celerity
are
4,2
sec.
and
lvl
3
Crescendo
cooldown
is
60
sec.
As
midlaner,
on
the
other
hand,
AP
items
with
side
utility
should
be
prioritized,
while
getting
CDR
as
close
to
40%
as
possible.
Athene's
Unholy
Grail
is
a
must,
while
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
and
Liandry's
Torment
are
good
to
have
items
to
make
you
both
slightly
more
durable,
and
increase
power
of
your
poke.
Lich
Bane
,
another
useful
item,
is
however
ignored
by
some
in
order
to
achieve
higher
AP
and
therefore
stronger
teamfight
impact,
sacrifying
personal
power
for
stronger
supportive
power.
Sona
is
extremely
valuable
in
group
pushes,
but
sustained
aura
rotation
can
deplete
her
mana
pool
quickly
if
not
equipped
properly,
consider
mana
regeneration
glyphs
per
level
to
make
sure
she
never
runs
out
of
mana.
Because
Sona
has
generally
low
cooldowns
,
low
mana
costs,
and
needs
to
constantly
switch
abilities,
she
charges
up
Seraph's
Embrace
faster
than
almost
any
other
champion.
This
also
helps
her,
as
it
provides
one
of
the
highest
mana
regens
in
the
game,
allows
her
to
stay
in
long
team
pushes
for
much
longer,
and
gives
her
a
small
shield
for
incoming
burst.
Mejai's
Soulstealer
,
while
not
always
viable,
generally
charges
up
quickly
as
long
as
you
stay
safe.
As
long
as
she
has
an
aura
active,
Sona
gets
assists
for
simply
being
at
teamfights.
With
40%
Cooldown
Reduction,
Sona
can
keep
stacks
of
Guinsoo's
Rageblade
up
easily.
Lich
Bane
can
add
a
significant
amount
of
damage
to
her
autoattack.
Combined
with
Power
Chord
it
can
provide
decent
burst
damage.

Sona
is
fairly
squishy
throughout
the
game,
especially
at
level
1.
Work
with
your
allies
to
kill
her
fast.
When
laning
against
Sona
,
be
sure
to
play
safe
as
she
can
boost
her
partner
with
her
supporting
spells.
All
of
Sona
's
active
stances
are
AoE
,
meaning
that
you
can
avoid
her
spells
by
moving
away
from
her.
Do
not
overextend
when
chasing
an
enemy
that
is
accompanied
with
Sona
.
Her
Song
of
Celerity
allows
her
to
outrun
you
very
quickly.
During
teamfights
try
to
kill
Sona
first,
since
she
provides
consistent
damage/defense
boosting
auras
through
the
teamfight,
as
well
as
an
AoE
stun.

Skill
usage
Thundering
Shuriken
can
be
used
to
detect
enemies
hiding
in
the
brush,
as
a
sound
effect
will
play
if
it
impacts
a
target.
Thundering
Shuriken
is
very
effective
for
harassment
.
Taking
more
than
one
point
in
it
early
game
allows
you
to
harass
the
enemy
really
hard
while
not
being
in
range
to
take
damage.
Using
Electrical
Surge
after
players
have
2
stacks
of
Mark
of
the
Storm
is
an
easy
way
to
stun.
Don't
forget
that
Electrical
Surge
has
a
passive
component,
try
to
save
the
passive
mark
applying
attack
for
combos
or
harass.
Kennen
is
a
great
farmer
if
you
use
Lightning
Rush
combined
with
Electrical
Surge
.
Using
Lightning
Rush
to
dodge
skillshots
and
run
away
is
a
good
idea.
Lightning
Rush
can
be
used
to
initiate
fights
with
its
energy
return
component,
allowing
him
to
use
other
abilities
afterward.
While
in
Lightning
Rush
form,
Kennen
cannot
perform
normal
attacks,
but
can
use
all
of
his
abilities.
Lightning
Rush
can
be
coupled
with
the
summoner
spell
Ghost
to
move
at
very
high
speeds,
with
Kennen's
stun
this
is
excellent
for
chasing.
Lightning
Rush
can
be
used
to
get
back
to
lane
quicker.
After
a
team
fight
has
initiated,
use
Lightning
Rush
to
apply
marks
to
as
many
enemies
as
possible,
followed
by
Electrical
Surge
and
Slicing
Maelstrom
.
This
combo
adds
two
marks
initially,
followed
by
one
mark
for
the
stun,
and
then
adds
an
additional
two
marks,
leaving
any
runners
ready
to
be
stunned
with
Thundering
Shuriken
.
Alternatively,
saving
energy
and
waiting
for
a
second
Electrical
Surge
will
result
in
a
second
AoE
stun.
A
good
skill
sequence
to
harass
an
enemy
or
to
scare
them
off
is
Lightning
Rush
,
Electrical
Surge
,
and
Thundering
Shuriken
(if
possible).
The
reason
why
this
combo
can
scare
enemy's
is
because
it
can
stun
or
get
ready
to
stun.
Kennen
is
a
champion
who
relies
heavily
on
combos.
Some
simple
combos
are:
Lightning
Rush
+
Electrical
Surge
+
Electrical
Surge
(passive)
+
Thundering
Shuriken
-
this
combo
works
extremely
well
from
levels
3-5
(ie
before
Slicing
Maelstrom
is
learned).
At
level
2,
Kennen
can
do
a
Electrical
Surge
+
Electrical
Surge
(passive)
+
Thundering
Shuriken
combo
to
result
in
a
highly
damaging
stun
and
a
few
auto
attacks
during
the
stun.
Once
reaching
level
6,
Kennen
gains
the
ability
to
stun
an
opponent
twice
using
a
Lightning
Rush
+
Electrical
Surge
+
Electrical
Surge
(passive)
+
Slicing
Maelstrom
+
Thundering
Shuriken
combo.
For
this
combo,
wait
the
longest
time
possible
between
the
Electrical
Surge
(passive)
(which
completes
the
1st
stun)
and
your
Slicing
Maelstrom
(which
completes
the
second
stun)
to
regenerate
Energy,
land
free
auto
attacks,
and
position
yourself
behind
the
enemy.
The
key
to
playing
well
is
learning
how
to
chain
his
combos
together
to
be
able
to
land
free
damage
on
the
enemy
while
keeping
them
in
a
disadvantageous
position.
A
good
way
to
build
Kennen
is
a
balanced
build,
which
focus
on
building
tankiness
as
well
as
damage.
With
all
three
skills
at
rank
2,
Kennen
becomes
a
powerful
enemy.
Kennen's
Slicing
Maelstrom
is
amazing
for
turning
team
fights
around.
It
is
key
that
his
R
is
used
as
much
as
possible
against
multiple
opponents,
but
only
at
the
right
time.
Kennen
tends
to
be
an
initiator
or
to
follow
immediately
behind
an
initiator
thanks
to
Slicing
Maelstrom
.
Using
Slicing
Maelstrom
wisely
in
a
team
fight,
in
conjunction
with
Lightning
Rush
and
Electrical
Surge
,
nearly
guarantees
a
viable
amount
of
energy
gained
from
Mark
of
the
Storm
because
Kennen's
cooldowns
tend
to
end
more
quickly
than
Kennen's
energy
regenerates.
Remember
that
Lightning
Rush
also
provides
you
with
a
great
boost
of
your
armor
and
magic
resistance
meaning
it
can
save
you
from
fatal
situations
like
Karthus'
Requiem
or
skills
that
do
damage
over
time,
notice
however
that
it
won't
reduce
true
damage.
One
of
Kennen
's
biggest
strengths
is
his
flexibility
of
item
builds
in
any
given
situation.
Kennen
can
easily
be
built
either
as
an
attack
damage
carry
or
an
ability
power
based
carry.
He's
also
a
very
powerful
top
laner
in
both
attack
damage
and
ability
power
based
builds
due
to
his
decent
attack
damage
scaling
and
Electrical
Surge
passive
and
split
pushing
ability
because
his
Lightning
Rush
can
serve
as
a
good
escape
mechanism
in
sticky
situations
as
well
as
serving
a
good
pushing
skill
in
conjunction
to
his
Electrical
Surge
active.
Ability
Power
build
strongly
utilizes
his
Thundering
Shuriken
,
Electrical
Surge
's
active,
and
Slicing
Maelstrom
.
The
ability
power
build
brings
more
teamfight
presence
and
large
crowd
control
stuns
on
the
enemy
teams
who
tend
to
be
grouped
together.
Because
Kennen
needs
to
be
in
the
frontlines
to
utilize
his
ultimate,
he
needs
to
built
a
bit
tanky
in
addition
to
ability
power
since
he
will
most
likely
be
focused
on.
The
ability
power
build
synergizes
well
with
champions
who
have
heavy
area
of
effect
damage
(i.e.
Ezreal
,
Ziggs
,
Amumu
,
and
Nunu
)
or
dive
heavy
team
compositions.
Attack
damage
builds
are
almost
similar
to
an
attack
damage
carry
where
he
puts
more
emphasis
on
autoattacking
because
of
his
Electrical
Surge
passive
scales
in
attack
damage
and
his
strong
self
crowd
control
and
utility
ability
with
his
Mark
of
the
Storm
,
something
that
most
attack
damage
carries
lack
with
a
few
exceptions
like
Ashe
and
Varus
.
Because
Kennen
uses
Energy
rather
than
mana,
he
has
better
sustain
than
many
other
attack
damage
carries
except
Sivir
.
Building
Kennen
as
an
attack
damage
carry
is
recommended
for
those
who
have
difficulty
landing
his
Thundering
Shuriken
,
laning
with
supports
who
lack
any
forms
of
healing
or
sustaining
the
attack
damage
carry
like
Lulu
,
Blitzcrank
,
Leona
,
and
Thresh
,
or
team
compositions
who
tend
to
focus
on
a
single
target.
Keep
in
note
that
attack
damage
carry
Kennen
tends
to
fall
flat
late
game
against
other
late
game
oriented
attack
damage
carries
like
(
Tristana
and
Kog'Maw
)
because
he
is
really
reliant
on
autoattacking
where
his
range
is
equivalent
to
Vayne
and
lacks
good
attack
speed/damage
steroid
unless
he
is
fed
early.
Build
usage
Getting
double
Doran's
Blade
early
game
allows
Kennen
to
be
a
strong
lane
bully
with
the
passive
of
Electrical
Surge
as
well
as
give
a
little
survivability.
Sheen
and
Lich
Bane
are
effective
items
on
Kennen.
If
Kennen
is
played
as
a
caster,
Lich
Bane
is
useful
for
increasing
the
amount
of
damage
he
does,
especially
since
his
Thundering
Shuriken
can
be
used
every
4
seconds
at
rank
5.
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
can
be
very
good
with
his
Lightning
Rush
,
since
you
can
get
very
fast
to
any
opponent
and
slow
him
this
way,
and
once
slowed
your
target
can
be
comboed
easily.
Since
Kennen
usually
relies
on
being
in
the
middle
of
their
team
an
Abyssal
Scepter
can
provide
you
with
more
damage
and
survivability
while
the
negative
aura
will
also
boost
the
damage
of
your
allied
magic
damage
dealers.
Since
Kennen
does
sustained
damage
using
energy,
building
an
early
Hextech
Revolver
is
a
good
idea
for
him,
particularly
if
you
are
facing
a
champion
who
has
their
own
built-in
sustain
like
Renekton
,
Vladimir
,
and
Yorick
.
When
upgrading
Hextech
Revolver
,
a
Hextech
Gunblade
is
far
superior
item
than
Will
of
the
Ancients
despite
being
more
expensive
for
several
reasons.
First,
the
spell
vamp
procs
in
all
of
his
abilities,
including
his
Electrical
Surge
's
passive.
Second,
Hextech
Gunblade
grants
attack
damage
and
life
steal
,
which
greatly
enhances
his
sustain
when
autoattacks
with
Electrical
Surge
passive.
Finally,
Kennen
does
not
benefit
from
Will
of
the
Ancients
's
mana
regeneration,
as
he
uses
energy
as
his
resource
instead
of
mana.
Because
most
of
the
foes
will
be
stunned,
Liandry's
Torment
is
a
good
item
to
build
on
Kennen
for
the
item's
passive.
Liandry's
Torment
also
procs
with
Kennen's
Electrical
Surge
passive
as
well.
It's
recommended
to
build
AP
along
with
defensive
items
as
Kennen's
full
combo
requires
getting
close
to
enemy
champions
and
therefore
survivability
will
be
a
must
during
teamfights.
As
Slicing
Maelstrom
is
not
a
channeled
ability,
you
can
use
it
in
conjunction
with
Zhonya's
Hourglass
or
Wooglet's
Witchcap
for
a
powerful
combo.
Giving
Kennen
Nashor's
Tooth
is
good
for
the
passive
effect
of
his
Electrical
Surge
as
it
gives
him
some
AP
to
deal
more
damage
with
spells.
Other
attack
speed
items
such
as
Wit's
End
,
Blade
of
the
Ruined
King
,
Statikk
Shiv
,
and
Runaan's
Hurricane
are
good
items
to
build
in
his
kit.
Much
like
Lulu
,
Fizz
,
Kayle
,
Kassadin
,
Nidalee
,
Orianna
,
and
Teemo
,
Kennen
is
one
of
the
few
champions
that
greatly
benefits
by
mixing
attack
speed
with
AP.
Statikk
Shiv
and
Runaan's
Hurricane
greatly
increases
Kennen's
wave
clearing
capacity,
particularly
the
later
where
he
can
quickly
gain
Electrical
Surge
stacks
for
his
passive.
While
a
niche
option,
because
of
Kennen's
high
attack
speed
growth,
a
decent
attack
damage
growth,
and
the
utilization
of
his
Electrical
Surge
;
Kennen
can
effectively
be
built
as
an
attack
damage
carry
in
a
similar
sense
like
Ezreal
.
Items
like
Phantom
Dancer
,
Trinity
Force
,
Statikk
Shiv
,
Blade
of
the
Ruined
King
,
Wit's
End
,
Runaan's
Hurricane
,
and
Nashor's
Tooth
can
allow
his
Electrical
Surge
passive's
Mark
of
the
Storm
trigger
more
quickly.
Because
his
Electrical
Surge's
passive
damage
is
scaled
in
attack
damage.
items
like
Infinity
Edge
,
The
Black
Cleaver
,
Last
Whisper
,
and
The
Bloodthirster
are
good
items
to
utilize.
The
attack
damage
carry
build
path
is
recommended
to
players
who
are
new
in
playing
Kennen,
or
those
who
have
difficulty
landing
his
Thundering
Shuriken
skill.

Countering
When
you
have
two
stacks
of
Mark
of
the
Storm
,
move
away
from
Kennen
until
the
debuff
wears
off
to
avoid
his
stun.
Moving
erratically
or
taking
cover
behind
minions
can
hinder
you
from
getting
hit
by
his
Thundering
Shuriken
.
Do
not
overextend
when
chasing
him
as
Lightning
Rush
also
boosts
his
armor
and
magic
resistance
.
If
Kennen
chases
you
and
fails
to
hit
with
his
Lightning
Rush
,
he
won't
gain
energy.
Use
this
as
your
advantage
since
Lightning
Rush
consumes
a
lot
of
energy.
Quickly
using
a
knockback
on
Kennen
while
Slicing
Maelstrom
is
active
can
cause
him
to
waste
the
ability.
Be
aware
Zhonya's
Hourglass
is
a
common
item
on
Kennen
to
avoid
such
a
possibility.
Kennen
primarily
deals
magic
damage.
Investing
in
magic
resistance
items
will
reduce
his
damage
output.
That
said,
Kennen
can
also
be
built
as
attack
damage
carry.
Pay
attention
to
his
build
to
counter
him
properly.
For
example,
reducing
his
attack
speed
will
lower
his
damage
and
stun
output.

Skill
usage
Thundering
Shuriken
can
be
used
to
detect
enemies
hiding
in
the
brush,
as
a
sound
effect
will
play
if
it
impacts
a
target.
Thundering
Shuriken
is
very
effective
for
harassment
.
Taking
more
than
one
point
in
it
early
game
allows
you
to
harass
the
enemy
really
hard
while
not
being
in
range
to
take
damage.
Using
Electrical
Surge
after
players
have
2
stacks
of
Mark
of
the
Storm
is
an
easy
way
to
stun.
Don't
forget
that
Electrical
Surge
has
a
passive
component,
try
to
save
the
passive
mark
applying
attack
for
combos
or
harass.
Kennen
is
a
great
farmer
if
you
use
Lightning
Rush
combined
with
Electrical
Surge
.
Using
Lightning
Rush
to
dodge
skillshots
and
run
away
is
a
good
idea.
Lightning
Rush
can
be
used
to
initiate
fights
with
its
energy
return
component,
allowing
him
to
use
other
abilities
afterward.
While
in
Lightning
Rush
form,
Kennen
cannot
perform
normal
attacks,
but
can
use
all
of
his
abilities.
Lightning
Rush
can
be
coupled
with
the
summoner
spell
Ghost
to
move
at
very
high
speeds,
with
Kennen's
stun
this
is
excellent
for
chasing.
Lightning
Rush
can
be
used
to
get
back
to
lane
quicker.
After
a
team
fight
has
initiated,
use
Lightning
Rush
to
apply
marks
to
as
many
enemies
as
possible,
followed
by
Electrical
Surge
and
Slicing
Maelstrom
.
This
combo
adds
two
marks
initially,
followed
by
one
mark
for
the
stun,
and
then
adds
an
additional
two
marks,
leaving
any
runners
ready
to
be
stunned
with
Thundering
Shuriken
.
Alternatively,
saving
energy
and
waiting
for
a
second
Electrical
Surge
will
result
in
a
second
AoE
stun.
A
good
skill
sequence
to
harass
an
enemy
or
to
scare
them
off
is
Lightning
Rush
,
Electrical
Surge
,
and
Thundering
Shuriken
(if
possible).
The
reason
why
this
combo
can
scare
enemy's
is
because
it
can
stun
or
get
ready
to
stun.
Kennen
is
a
champion
who
relies
heavily
on
combos.
Some
simple
combos
are:
Lightning
Rush
+
Electrical
Surge
+
Electrical
Surge
(passive)
+
Thundering
Shuriken
-
this
combo
works
extremely
well
from
levels
3-5
(ie
before
Slicing
Maelstrom
is
learned).
At
level
2,
Kennen
can
do
a
Electrical
Surge
+
Electrical
Surge
(passive)
+
Thundering
Shuriken
combo
to
result
in
a
highly
damaging
stun
and
a
few
auto
attacks
during
the
stun.
Once
reaching
level
6,
Kennen
gains
the
ability
to
stun
an
opponent
twice
using
a
Lightning
Rush
+
Electrical
Surge
+
Electrical
Surge
(passive)
+
Slicing
Maelstrom
+
Thundering
Shuriken
combo.
For
this
combo,
wait
the
longest
time
possible
between
the
Electrical
Surge
(passive)
(which
completes
the
1st
stun)
and
your
Slicing
Maelstrom
(which
completes
the
second
stun)
to
regenerate
Energy,
land
free
auto
attacks,
and
position
yourself
behind
the
enemy.
The
key
to
playing
well
is
learning
how
to
chain
his
combos
together
to
be
able
to
land
free
damage
on
the
enemy
while
keeping
them
in
a
disadvantageous
position.
A
good
way
to
build
Kennen
is
a
balanced
build,
which
focus
on
building
tankiness
as
well
as
damage.
With
all
three
skills
at
rank
2,
Kennen
becomes
a
powerful
enemy.
Kennen's
Slicing
Maelstrom
is
amazing
for
turning
team
fights
around.
It
is
key
that
his
R
is
used
as
much
as
possible
against
multiple
opponents,
but
only
at
the
right
time.
Kennen
tends
to
be
an
initiator
or
to
follow
immediately
behind
an
initiator
thanks
to
Slicing
Maelstrom
.
Using
Slicing
Maelstrom
wisely
in
a
team
fight,
in
conjunction
with
Lightning
Rush
and
Electrical
Surge
,
nearly
guarantees
a
viable
amount
of
energy
gained
from
Mark
of
the
Storm
because
Kennen's
cooldowns
tend
to
end
more
quickly
than
Kennen's
energy
regenerates.
Remember
that
Lightning
Rush
also
provides
you
with
a
great
boost
of
your
armor
and
magic
resistance
meaning
it
can
save
you
from
fatal
situations
like
Karthus'
Requiem
or
skills
that
do
damage
over
time,
notice
however
that
it
won't
reduce
true
damage.
One
of
Kennen
's
biggest
strengths
is
his
flexibility
of
item
builds
in
any
given
situation.
Kennen
can
easily
be
built
either
as
an
attack
damage
carry
or
an
ability
power
based
carry.
He's
also
a
very
powerful
top
laner
in
both
attack
damage
and
ability
power
based
builds
due
to
his
decent
attack
damage
scaling
and
Electrical
Surge
passive
and
split
pushing
ability
because
his
Lightning
Rush
can
serve
as
a
good
escape
mechanism
in
sticky
situations
as
well
as
serving
a
good
pushing
skill
in
conjunction
to
his
Electrical
Surge
active.
Ability
Power
build
strongly
utilizes
his
Thundering
Shuriken
,
Electrical
Surge
's
active,
and
Slicing
Maelstrom
.
The
ability
power
build
brings
more
teamfight
presence
and
large
crowd
control
stuns
on
the
enemy
teams
who
tend
to
be
grouped
together.
Because
Kennen
needs
to
be
in
the
frontlines
to
utilize
his
ultimate,
he
needs
to
built
a
bit
tanky
in
addition
to
ability
power
since
he
will
most
likely
be
focused
on.
The
ability
power
build
synergizes
well
with
champions
who
have
heavy
area
of
effect
damage
(i.e.
Ezreal
,
Ziggs
,
Amumu
,
and
Nunu
)
or
dive
heavy
team
compositions.
Attack
damage
builds
are
almost
similar
to
an
attack
damage
carry
where
he
puts
more
emphasis
on
autoattacking
because
of
his
Electrical
Surge
passive
scales
in
attack
damage
and
his
strong
self
crowd
control
and
utility
ability
with
his
Mark
of
the
Storm
,
something
that
most
attack
damage
carries
lack
with
a
few
exceptions
like
Ashe
and
Varus
.
Because
Kennen
uses
Energy
rather
than
mana,
he
has
better
sustain
than
many
other
attack
damage
carries
except
Sivir
.
Building
Kennen
as
an
attack
damage
carry
is
recommended
for
those
who
have
difficulty
landing
his
Thundering
Shuriken
,
laning
with
supports
who
lack
any
forms
of
healing
or
sustaining
the
attack
damage
carry
like
Lulu
,
Blitzcrank
,
Leona
,
and
Thresh
,
or
team
compositions
who
tend
to
focus
on
a
single
target.
Keep
in
note
that
attack
damage
carry
Kennen
tends
to
fall
flat
late
game
against
other
late
game
oriented
attack
damage
carries
like
(
Tristana
and
Kog'Maw
)
because
he
is
really
reliant
on
autoattacking
where
his
range
is
equivalent
to
Vayne
and
lacks
good
attack
speed/damage
steroid
unless
he
is
fed
early.
Build
usage
Getting
double
Doran's
Blade
early
game
allows
Kennen
to
be
a
strong
lane
bully
with
the
passive
of
Electrical
Surge
as
well
as
give
a
little
survivability.
Sheen
and
Lich
Bane
are
effective
items
on
Kennen.
If
Kennen
is
played
as
a
caster,
Lich
Bane
is
useful
for
increasing
the
amount
of
damage
he
does,
especially
since
his
Thundering
Shuriken
can
be
used
every
4
seconds
at
rank
5.
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
can
be
very
good
with
his
Lightning
Rush
,
since
you
can
get
very
fast
to
any
opponent
and
slow
him
this
way,
and
once
slowed
your
target
can
be
comboed
easily.
Since
Kennen
usually
relies
on
being
in
the
middle
of
their
team
an
Abyssal
Scepter
can
provide
you
with
more
damage
and
survivability
while
the
negative
aura
will
also
boost
the
damage
of
your
allied
magic
damage
dealers.
Since
Kennen
does
sustained
damage
using
energy,
building
an
early
Hextech
Revolver
is
a
good
idea
for
him,
particularly
if
you
are
facing
a
champion
who
has
their
own
built-in
sustain
like
Renekton
,
Vladimir
,
and
Yorick
.
When
upgrading
Hextech
Revolver
,
a
Hextech
Gunblade
is
far
superior
item
than
Will
of
the
Ancients
despite
being
more
expensive
for
several
reasons.
First,
the
spell
vamp
procs
in
all
of
his
abilities,
including
his
Electrical
Surge
's
passive.
Second,
Hextech
Gunblade
grants
attack
damage
and
life
steal
,
which
greatly
enhances
his
sustain
when
autoattacks
with
Electrical
Surge
passive.
Finally,
Kennen
does
not
benefit
from
Will
of
the
Ancients
's
mana
regeneration,
as
he
uses
energy
as
his
resource
instead
of
mana.
Because
most
of
the
foes
will
be
stunned,
Liandry's
Torment
is
a
good
item
to
build
on
Kennen
for
the
item's
passive.
Liandry's
Torment
also
procs
with
Kennen's
Electrical
Surge
passive
as
well.
It's
recommended
to
build
AP
along
with
defensive
items
as
Kennen's
full
combo
requires
getting
close
to
enemy
champions
and
therefore
survivability
will
be
a
must
during
teamfights.
As
Slicing
Maelstrom
is
not
a
channeled
ability,
you
can
use
it
in
conjunction
with
Zhonya's
Hourglass
or
Wooglet's
Witchcap
for
a
powerful
combo.
Giving
Kennen
Nashor's
Tooth
is
good
for
the
passive
effect
of
his
Electrical
Surge
as
it
gives
him
some
AP
to
deal
more
damage
with
spells.
Other
attack
speed
items
such
as
Wit's
End
,
Blade
of
the
Ruined
King
,
Statikk
Shiv
,
and
Runaan's
Hurricane
are
good
items
to
build
in
his
kit.
Much
like
Lulu
,
Fizz
,
Kayle
,
Kassadin
,
Nidalee
,
Orianna
,
and
Teemo
,
Kennen
is
one
of
the
few
champions
that
greatly
benefits
by
mixing
attack
speed
with
AP.
Statikk
Shiv
and
Runaan's
Hurricane
greatly
increases
Kennen's
wave
clearing
capacity,
particularly
the
later
where
he
can
quickly
gain
Electrical
Surge
stacks
for
his
passive.
While
a
niche
option,
because
of
Kennen's
high
attack
speed
growth,
a
decent
attack
damage
growth,
and
the
utilization
of
his
Electrical
Surge
;
Kennen
can
effectively
be
built
as
an
attack
damage
carry
in
a
similar
sense
like
Ezreal
.
Items
like
Phantom
Dancer
,
Trinity
Force
,
Statikk
Shiv
,
Blade
of
the
Ruined
King
,
Wit's
End
,
Runaan's
Hurricane
,
and
Nashor's
Tooth
can
allow
his
Electrical
Surge
passive's
Mark
of
the
Storm
trigger
more
quickly.
Because
his
Electrical
Surge's
passive
damage
is
scaled
in
attack
damage.
items
like
Infinity
Edge
,
The
Black
Cleaver
,
Last
Whisper
,
and
The
Bloodthirster
are
good
items
to
utilize.
The
attack
damage
carry
build
path
is
recommended
to
players
who
are
new
in
playing
Kennen,
or
those
who
have
difficulty
landing
his
Thundering
Shuriken
skill.

Countering
When
you
have
two
stacks
of
Mark
of
the
Storm
,
move
away
from
Kennen
until
the
debuff
wears
off
to
avoid
his
stun.
Moving
erratically
or
taking
cover
behind
minions
can
hinder
you
from
getting
hit
by
his
Thundering
Shuriken
.
Do
not
overextend
when
chasing
him
as
Lightning
Rush
also
boosts
his
armor
and
magic
resistance
.
If
Kennen
chases
you
and
fails
to
hit
with
his
Lightning
Rush
,
he
won't
gain
energy.
Use
this
as
your
advantage
since
Lightning
Rush
consumes
a
lot
of
energy.
Quickly
using
a
knockback
on
Kennen
while
Slicing
Maelstrom
is
active
can
cause
him
to
waste
the
ability.
Be
aware
Zhonya's
Hourglass
is
a
common
item
on
Kennen
to
avoid
such
a
possibility.
Kennen
primarily
deals
magic
damage.
Investing
in
magic
resistance
items
will
reduce
his
damage
output.
That
said,
Kennen
can
also
be
built
as
attack
damage
carry.
Pay
attention
to
his
build
to
counter
him
properly.
For
example,
reducing
his
attack
speed
will
lower
his
damage
and
stun
output.

a
target.
Thundering
Shuriken
is
very
effective
for
harassment
.
Taking
more
than
one
point
in
it
early
game
allows
you
to
harass
the
enemy
really
hard
while
not
being
in
range
to
take
damage.
Using
Electrical
Surge
after
players
have
2
stacks
of
Mark
of
the
Storm
is
an
easy
way
to
stun.
Don't
forget
that
Electrical
Surge
has
a
passive
component,
try
to
save
the
passive
mark
applying
attack
for
combos
or
harass.
Kennen
is
a
great
farmer
if
you
use
Lightning
Rush
combined
with
Electrical
Surge
.
Using
Lightning
Rush
to
dodge
skillshots
and
run
away
is
a
good
idea.
Lightning
Rush
can
be
used
to
initiate
fights
with
its
energy
return
component,
allowing
him
to
use
other
abilities
afterward.
While
in
Lightning
Rush
form,
Kennen
cannot
perform
normal
attacks,
but
can
use
all
of
his
abilities.
Lightning
Rush
can
be
coupled
with
the
summoner
spell
Ghost
to
move
at
very
high
speeds,
with
Kennen's
stun
this
is
excellent
for
chasing.
Lightning
Rush
can
be
used
to
get
back
to
lane
quicker.
After
a
team
fight
has
initiated,
use
Lightning
Rush
to
apply
marks
to
as
many
enemies
as
possible,
followed
by
Electrical
Surge
and
Slicing
Maelstrom
.
This
combo
adds
two
marks
initially,
followed
by
one
mark
for
the
stun,
and
then
adds
an
additional
two
marks,
leaving
any
runners
ready
to
be
stunned
with
Thundering
Shuriken
.
Alternatively,
saving
energy
and
waiting
for
a
second
Electrical
Surge
will
result
in
a
second
AoE
stun.
A
good
skill
sequence
to
harass
an
enemy
or
to
scare
them
off
is
Lightning
Rush
,
Electrical
Surge
,
and
Thundering
Shuriken
(if
possible).
The
reason
why
this
combo
can
scare
enemy's
is
because
it
can
stun
or
get
ready
to
stun.
Kennen
is
a
champion
who
relies
heavily
on
combos.
Some
simple
combos
are:
Lightning
Rush
+
Electrical
Surge
+
Electrical
Surge
(passive)
+
Thundering
Shuriken
-
this
combo
works
extremely
well
from
levels
3-5
(ie
before
Slicing
Maelstrom
is
learned).
At
level
2,
Kennen
can
do
a
Electrical
Surge
+
Electrical
Surge
(passive)
+
Thundering
Shuriken
combo
to
result
in
a
highly
damaging
stun
and
a
few
auto
attacks
during
the
stun.
Once
reaching
level
6,
Kennen
gains
the
ability
to
stun
an
opponent
twice
using
a
Lightning
Rush
+
Electrical
Surge
+
Electrical
Surge
(passive)
+
Slicing
Maelstrom
+
Thundering
Shuriken
combo.
For
this
combo,
wait
the
longest
time
possible
between
the
Electrical
Surge
(passive)
(which
completes
the
1st
stun)
and
your
Slicing
Maelstrom
(which
completes
the
second
stun)
to
regenerate
Energy,
land
free
auto
attacks,
and
position
yourself
behind
the
enemy.
The
key
to
playing
well
is
learning
how
to
chain
his
combos
together
to
be
able
to
land
free
damage
on
the
enemy
while
keeping
them
in
a
disadvantageous
position.
A
good
way
to
build
Kennen
is
a
balanced
build,
which
focus
on
building
tankiness
as
well
as
damage.
With
all
three
skills
at
rank
2,
Kennen
becomes
a
powerful
enemy.
Kennen's
Slicing
Maelstrom
is
amazing
for
turning
team
fights
around.
It
is
key
that
his
R
is
used
as
much
as
possible
against
multiple
opponents,
but
only
at
the
right
time.
Kennen
tends
to
be
an
initiator
or
to
follow
immediately
behind
an
initiator
thanks
to
Slicing
Maelstrom
.
Using
Slicing
Maelstrom
wisely
in
a
team
fight,
in
conjunction
with
Lightning
Rush
and
Electrical
Surge
,
nearly
guarantees
a
viable
amount
of
energy
gained
from
Mark
of
the
Storm
because
Kennen's
cooldowns
tend
to
end
more
quickly
than
Kennen's
energy
regenerates.
Remember
that
Lightning
Rush
also
provides
you
with
a
great
boost
of
your
armor
and
magic
resistance
meaning
it
can
save
you
from
fatal
situations
like
Karthus'
Requiem
or
skills
that
do
damage
over
time,
notice
however
that
it
won't
reduce
true
damage.
One
of
Kennen
's
biggest
strengths
is
his
flexibility
of
item
builds
in
any
given
situation.
Kennen
can
easily
be
built
either
as
an
attack
damage
carry
or
an
ability
power
based
carry.
He's
also
a
very
powerful
top
laner
in
both
attack
damage
and
ability
power
based
builds
due
to
his
decent
attack
damage
scaling
and
Electrical
Surge
passive
and
split
pushing
ability
because
his
Lightning
Rush
can
serve
as
a
good
escape
mechanism
in
sticky
situations
as
well
as
serving
a
good
pushing
skill
in
conjunction
to
his
Electrical
Surge
active.
Ability
Power
build
strongly
utilizes
his
Thundering
Shuriken
,
Electrical
Surge
's
active,
and
Slicing
Maelstrom
.
The
ability
power
build
brings
more
teamfight
presence
and
large
crowd
control
stuns
on
the
enemy
teams
who
tend
to
be
grouped
together.
Because
Kennen
needs
to
be
in
the
frontlines
to
utilize
his
ultimate,
he
needs
to
built
a
bit
tanky
in
addition
to
ability
power
since
he
will
most
likely
be
focused
on.
The
ability
power
build
synergizes
well
with
champions
who
have
heavy
area
of
effect
damage
(i.e.
Ezreal
,
Ziggs
,
Amumu
,
and
Nunu
)
or
dive
heavy
team
compositions.
Attack
damage
builds
are
almost
similar
to
an
attack
damage
carry
where
he
puts
more
emphasis
on
autoattacking
because
of
his
Electrical
Surge
passive
scales
in
attack
damage
and
his
strong
self
crowd
control
and
utility
ability
with
his
Mark
of
the
Storm
,
something
that
most
attack
damage
carries
lack
with
a
few
exceptions
like
Ashe
and
Varus
.
Because
Kennen
uses
Energy
rather
than
mana,
he
has
better
sustain
than
many
other
attack
damage
carries
except
Sivir
.
Building
Kennen
as
an
attack
damage
carry
is
recommended
for
those
who
have
difficulty
landing
his
Thundering
Shuriken
,
laning
with
supports
who
lack
any
forms
of
healing
or
sustaining
the
attack
damage
carry
like
Lulu
,
Blitzcrank
,
Leona
,
and
Thresh
,
or
team
compositions
who
tend
to
focus
on
a
single
target.
Keep
in
note
that
attack
damage
carry
Kennen
tends
to
fall
flat
late
game
against
other
late
game
oriented
attack
damage
carries
like
(
Tristana
and
Kog'Maw
)
because
he
is
really
reliant
on
autoattacking
where
his
range
is
equivalent
to
Vayne
and
lacks
good
attack
speed/damage
steroid
unless
he
is
fed
early.
Build
usage
Getting
double
Doran's
Blade
early
game
allows
Kennen
to
be
a
strong
lane
bully
with
the
passive
of
Electrical
Surge
as
well
as
give
a
little
survivability.
Sheen
and
Lich
Bane
are
effective
items
on
Kennen.
If
Kennen
is
played
as
a
caster,
Lich
Bane
is
useful
for
increasing
the
amount
of
damage
he
does,
especially
since
his
Thundering
Shuriken
can
be
used
every
4
seconds
at
rank
5.
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
can
be
very
good
with
his
Lightning
Rush
,
since
you
can
get
very
fast
to
any
opponent
and
slow
him
this
way,
and
once
slowed
your
target
can
be
comboed
easily.
Since
Kennen
usually
relies
on
being
in
the
middle
of
their
team
an
Abyssal
Scepter
can
provide
you
with
more
damage
and
survivability
while
the
negative
aura
will
also
boost
the
damage
of
your
allied
magic
damage
dealers.
Since
Kennen
does
sustained
damage
using
energy,
building
an
early
Hextech
Revolver
is
a
good
idea
for
him,
particularly
if
you
are
facing
a
champion
who
has
their
own
built-in
sustain
like
Renekton
,
Vladimir
,
and
Yorick
.
When
upgrading
Hextech
Revolver
,
a
Hextech
Gunblade
is
far
superior
item
than
Will
of
the
Ancients
despite
being
more
expensive
for
several
reasons.
First,
the
spell
vamp
procs
in
all
of
his
abilities,
including
his
Electrical
Surge
's
passive.
Second,
Hextech
Gunblade
grants
attack
damage
and
life
steal
,
which
greatly
enhances
his
sustain
when
autoattacks
with
Electrical
Surge
passive.
Finally,
Kennen
does
not
benefit
from
Will
of
the
Ancients
's
mana
regeneration,
as
he
uses
energy
as
his
resource
instead
of
mana.
Because
most
of
the
foes
will
be
stunned,
Liandry's
Torment
is
a
good
item
to
build
on
Kennen
for
the
item's
passive.
Liandry's
Torment
also
procs
with
Kennen's
Electrical
Surge
passive
as
well.
It's
recommended
to
build
AP
along
with
defensive
items
as
Kennen's
full
combo
requires
getting
close
to
enemy
champions
and
therefore
survivability
will
be
a
must
during
teamfights.
As
Slicing
Maelstrom
is
not
a
channeled
ability,
you
can
use
it
in
conjunction
with
Zhonya's
Hourglass
or
Wooglet's
Witchcap
for
a
powerful
combo.
Giving
Kennen
Nashor's
Tooth
is
good
for
the
passive
effect
of
his
Electrical
Surge
as
it
gives
him
some
AP
to
deal
more
damage
with
spells.
Other
attack
speed
items
such
as
Wit's
End
,
Blade
of
the
Ruined
King
,
Statikk
Shiv
,
and
Runaan's
Hurricane
are
good
items
to
build
in
his
kit.
Much
like
Lulu
,
Fizz
,
Kayle
,
Kassadin
,
Nidalee
,
Orianna
,
and
Teemo
,
Kennen
is
one
of
the
few
champions
that
greatly
benefits
by
mixing
attack
speed
with
AP.
Statikk
Shiv
and
Runaan's
Hurricane
greatly
increases
Kennen's
wave
clearing
capacity,
particularly
the
later
where
he
can
quickly
gain
Electrical
Surge
stacks
for
his
passive.
While
a
niche
option,
because
of
Kennen's
high
attack
speed
growth,
a
decent
attack
damage
growth,
and
the
utilization
of
his
Electrical
Surge
;
Kennen
can
effectively
be
built
as
an
attack
damage
carry
in
a
similar
sense
like
Ezreal
.
Items
like
Phantom
Dancer
,
Trinity
Force
,
Statikk
Shiv
,
Blade
of
the
Ruined
King
,
Wit's
End
,
Runaan's
Hurricane
,
and
Nashor's
Tooth
can
allow
his
Electrical
Surge
passive's
Mark
of
the
Storm
trigger
more
quickly.
Because
his
Electrical
Surge's
passive
damage
is
scaled
in
attack
damage.
items
like
Infinity
Edge
,
The
Black
Cleaver
,
Last
Whisper
,
and
The
Bloodthirster
are
good
items
to
utilize.
The
attack
damage
carry
build
path
is
recommended
to
players
who
are
new
in
playing
Kennen,
or
those
who
have
difficulty
landing
his
Thundering
Shuriken
skill.

When
you
have
two
stacks
of
Mark
of
the
Storm
,
move
away
from
Kennen
until
the
debuff
wears
off
to
avoid
his
stun.
Moving
erratically
or
taking
cover
behind
minions
can
hinder
you
from
getting
hit
by
his
Thundering
Shuriken
.
Do
not
overextend
when
chasing
him
as
Lightning
Rush
also
boosts
his
armor
and
magic
resistance
.
If
Kennen
chases
you
and
fails
to
hit
with
his
Lightning
Rush
,
he
won't
gain
energy.
Use
this
as
your
advantage
since
Lightning
Rush
consumes
a
lot
of
energy.
Quickly
using
a
knockback
on
Kennen
while
Slicing
Maelstrom
is
active
can
cause
him
to
waste
the
ability.
Be
aware
Zhonya's
Hourglass
is
a
common
item
on
Kennen
to
avoid
such
a
possibility.
Kennen
primarily
deals
magic
damage.
Investing
in
magic
resistance
items
will
reduce
his
damage
output.
That
said,
Kennen
can
also
be
built
as
attack
damage
carry.
Pay
attention
to
his
build
to
counter
him
properly.
For
example,
reducing
his
attack
speed
will
lower
his
damage
and
stun
output.

The
team

one
of
the
six
competitors
in
Garena
Premier
League
Season

which
took
place
on
May
18th
2012.
They
are
living
like
shadows
in
her
cobijo
like
a
wherever
you
are.
Winners
of
season
one
and
two
in
a
row
arrow
in
the
face
like
Ashe
when
hit
six,
you
know.
The
team
was
ruled
out
from
the
Season
2
World
Championship
qualification
by
Saigon
Jokers
in
the
Grand
Final
of
Season
Two
South
East
Asia
Regional
Finals

Da
Nang,Vietnam.
At
the
end
of
November,

competed
in
the
IGN

They
were
defeated
by
the
Taipei
Assasins
in
Round

and
was
placed
10th
in
9-12th
overrall.
Roster
Changes
One
major
twist
from
the
team,
dubbed
Singapore
Sentinels
v2.0
,
reshuffled
roles
to
accommodate
the
new
line-up
of
the
team
and
was
used
against
the
Taipei
Assassins
during
the
Garena
Premier
League.
The
reshuffled
roles
was
due
to
ToFuBoi's
leave
for
compulsory
military
service.
SGS
Equivocal
anounced
his
leave
on
December
21st
2012
due
to
personal
reasons
and
recruited
hyhy
on
the
January
10th
2013
to
play
as
AD
Carry.
