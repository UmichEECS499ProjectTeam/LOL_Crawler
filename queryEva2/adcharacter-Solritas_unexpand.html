Guinsoo
Feak
is
one
of
the
original
creators
of
DotA-Allstars,
which
is
a
mod
of
Warcraft
3
played
by
over
10
million
people
worldwide.
Despite
this,
Steve
is
a
modest
man
from
humble
beginnings.
He
was
born
under
a
haystack
in
Wisconsin
and
enjoys
spending
time
with
his
girlfriend,
eating
good
old
American
food,
and
playing
with
his
cat.
He
is
also
a
diehard
Brewers,
Packers,
and
Bucks
fan.
As
a
gamer,
Steve
has
a
special
place
in
his
heart
for
World
of
Warcraft,
Counter-Strike,
Diablo
2,
DotA,
and
old-school
RPGs.
Special
Ability

:
Guinsoo
solves
a
Rubiks
cube
with
a
few
deft
flicks
of
the
wrists
and
enters
a
deep
calm
visualizing
a
new
character
being
played
in-game.
Using
this
vision,
Guinsoo
pieces
together
spell
building
blocks
and
design
ideas
to
bring
the
character
to
life.
DotA:
Allstars
Main
article:
Defense
of
the
Ancients:
Allstars
Feak
was
the
previous
designer
of
the
popular
Warcraft
III:
the
Frozen
Throne
custom
map,
DotA:
Allstars.
Using
the
original
DotA
created
by
Eul
(the
original
Defense
of
the
Ancients
map
for
Warcraft
III:
Reign
Of
Chaos
as
a
base,
Feak
made
DotA:
Allstars
by
adding
his
own
mix
of
content.
Among
the
DotA
variants
created
in
the
wake
of
Eul's
map,
Allstars
become
the
most
popular
version
of
the
map.
Feak
said
when
he
began
developing
Allstars
he
had
no
idea
how
popular
the
game
would
eventually
become;
the
emerging
success
of
the
game
type
inspired
him
to
design
a
new
title
around
what
he
considered
an
emerging
game
genre.
Feak
added
a
recipe
system
for
items
so
that
player's
equipment
would
scale
as
they
grew
more
powerful,
as
well
as
a
powerful
boss
character
called
Roshan
(named
after
his
bowling
ball)
who
required
an
entire
team
to
defeat.
Feak
used
a
Battle.net
chat
channel
as
a
place
for
DotA
players
to
congregate,
but
DotA:
Allstars
had
no
official
site
for
discussions
and
hosting.
The
leaders
of
the
DotA:
Allstars
CLAN,
TDA,
proposed
that
a
dedicated
web
site
be
created
to
replace
the
various
online
alternatives
that
were
infrequently
updated
or
improperly
maintained.
Towards
the
end
of
his
association
with
the
map,
Feak
primarily
worked
on
optimizing
the
map,
then
he
left
development
with
version
6.01,
passing
it
to
the
current
developer,
Icefrog.

Steve
Guinsoo
Feak
is
one
of
the
original
creators
of
DotA-Allstars,
which
is
a
mod
of
Warcraft
3
played
by
over
10
million
people
worldwide.
Despite
this,
Steve
is
a
modest
man
from
humble
beginnings.
He
was
born
under
a
haystack
in
Wisconsin
and
enjoys
spending
time
with
his
girlfriend,
eating
good
old
American
food,
and
playing
with
his
cat.
He
is
also
a
diehard
Brewers,
Packers,
and
Bucks
fan.
As
a
gamer,
Steve
has
a
special
place
in
his
heart
for
World
of
Warcraft,
Counter-Strike,
Diablo
2,
DotA,
and
old-school
RPGs.
Special
Ability
Clairvoyance
:
Guinsoo
solves
a
Rubiks
cube
with
a
few
deft
flicks
of
the
wrists
and
enters
a
deep
calm
visualizing
a
new
character
being
played
in-game.
Using
this
vision,
Guinsoo
pieces
together
spell
building
blocks
and
design
ideas
to
bring
the
character
to
life.
DotA:
Allstars
Main
article:
Defense
of
the
Ancients:
Allstars
Feak
was
the
previous
designer
of
the
popular
Warcraft
III:
the
Frozen
Throne
custom
map,
DotA:
Allstars.
Using
the
original
DotA
created
by
Eul
(the
original
Defense
of
the
Ancients
map
for
Warcraft
III:
Reign
Of
Chaos
as
a
base,
Feak
made
DotA:
Allstars
by
adding
his
own
mix
of
content.
Among
the
DotA
variants
created
in
the
wake
of
Eul's
map,
Allstars
become
the
most
popular
version
of
the
map.
Feak
said
when
he
began
developing
Allstars
he
had
no
idea
how
popular
the
game
would
eventually
become;
the
emerging
success
of
the
game
type
inspired
him
to
design
a
new
title
around
what
he
considered
an
emerging
game
genre.
Feak
added
a
recipe
system
for
items
so
that
player's
equipment
would
scale
as
they
grew
more
powerful,
as
well
as
a
powerful
boss
character
called
Roshan
(named
after
his
bowling
ball)
who
required
an
entire
team
to
defeat.
Feak
used
a
Battle.net
chat
channel
as
a
place
for
DotA
players
to
congregate,
but
DotA:
Allstars
had
no
official
site
for
discussions
and
hosting.
The
leaders
of
the
DotA:
Allstars
CLAN,
TDA,
proposed
that
a
dedicated
web
site
be
created
to
replace
the
various
online
alternatives
that
were
infrequently
updated
or
improperly
maintained.
Towards
the
end
of
his
association
with
the
map,
Feak
primarily
worked
on
optimizing
the
map,
then
he
left
development
with
version
6.01,
passing
it
to
the
current
developer,
Icefrog.

made
DotA:
Allstars
by
adding
his
own
mix
of
content.
Among
the
DotA
variants
created
in
the
wake
of
Eul's
map,
Allstars
become
the
most
popular
version
of
the
map.
Feak
said
when
he
began
developing
Allstars
he
had
no
idea
how
popular
the
game
would
eventually
become;
the
emerging
success
of
the
game
type
inspired
him
to
design
a
new
title
around
what
he
considered
an
emerging
game
genre.
Feak
added
a
recipe
system
for
items
so
that
player's
equipment
would
scale
as
they
grew
more
powerful,
as
well
as
a
powerful
boss
character
called
Roshan
(named
after
his
bowling
ball)
who
required
an
entire
team
to
defeat.
Feak
used
a
Battle.net
chat
channel
as
a
place
for
DotA
players
to
congregate,
but
DotA:
Allstars
had
no
official
site
for
discussions
and
hosting.
The
leaders
of
the
DotA:
Allstars
CLAN,
TDA,
proposed
that
a
dedicated
web
site
be
created
to
replace
the
various
online
alternatives
that
were
infrequently
updated
or
improperly
maintained.
Towards
the
end
of
his
association
with
the
map,
Feak
primarily
worked
on
optimizing
the
map,
then
he
left
development
with

to
the

name
and
past

Comics
character
Bruce
Wayne,
the
Batman

be
a
reference
to
the

the
the

some
resemblance
to
the
main
character
from
the
game

Bolts
,

a
reference
to

have
a
quote
play
out
when
learning
a
skill.
Vayne's
quote
&quot;On
wings
of
night.&quot;
is
similar
to
Shyvana's
quote
&quot;On
wings
of
fury.&quot;
Vayne's
quote
when
using
her
ultimate,
&quot;The
die
is
cast&quot;

Skins
In
the
background
of
Classic
Vayne's
splash
art,
there

a
tombstone
labeled
&quot;URF&quot;
in
reference
to
Urf,
the
Manatee
,

Yorick's
shovel.
Vindicator
Vayne

likely
a
reference
to
the
Death
Dealers
from
the
Underworld
film
series.
Vayne
in
her
Aristocrat
skin
is
wearing
Steampunk-styled
clothing.
Heartseeker
Vayne

shown
shot
down
in
the
background
with
a
bouquet
of
roses,
and
Vayne
herself
is
reading
a
macaroni
card
made
by
him.
In
its
Chinese
artwork,
Jack
of
Hearts
Twisted
Fate

be
seen
in
the
background.

is
speculation
that

activities
of
LeBlanc
and
the
Black
Rose
organization.

Trivia
Vayne's
first
name
is
Shauna.
Like
many
other
hunters
of
the
supernatural,
Vayne's
character
concept
is
inspired
by
Abraham
van
Helsing
,
the
protagonist
from
Bram
Stoker's
1897
novel,
Dracula
.
Vayne's
name
and
past
are
possible
references
to
DC
Comics
character
Bruce
Wayne,
the
Batman
.
Vayne
may
also
be
a
reference
to
the
DC
Comics
character
Huntress
,
due
to
the
the
similarities
between
their
weapons
and
pasts.
Vayne
bears
some
resemblance
to
the
main
character
from
the
game
Bayonetta
.
Vayne's
Silver
Bolts
,
is
a
reference
to
the
belief
that
supernatural
creatures,
particularly
werewolves
,
are
vulnerable
to
weapons
made
from
silver.
Vayne
is
the
only
champion
to
currently
have
a
defense
rating
of
1.
Vayne's
dance
is
inspired
by
the
Gun
Kata
.
A
side-by-side
comparison
can
be
seen
here
.
Vayne
is
the
first
champion
who
shares
her
title
with
a
skill
name
,
followed
by
Zyra
.
Quotes
Vayne
is
the
first
champion
to
always
have
a
quote
play
out
when
learning
a
skill.
Vayne's
quote
&quot;On
wings
of
night.&quot;
is
similar
to
Shyvana's
quote
&quot;On
wings
of
fury.&quot;
Vayne's
quote
when
using
her
ultimate,
&quot;The
die
is
cast&quot;
is
a
reference
to
Julius'
Caesar
phrase
&quot;Alea
Iacta
Est&quot;
.
[1]
Skins
In
the
background
of
Classic
Vayne's
splash
art,
there
is
a
tombstone
labeled
&quot;URF&quot;
in
reference
to
Urf,
the
Manatee
,
and
Yorick's
shovel.
Vindicator
Vayne
is
likely
a
reference
to
the
Death
Dealers
from
the
Underworld
film
series.
Vayne
in
her
Aristocrat
skin
is
wearing
Steampunk-styled
clothing.
Heartseeker
Vayne
is
a
tribute
to
Valentine's
Day.
In
her
Heartseeker
skin,
Dr.
Mundo
is
shown
shot
down
in
the
background
with
a
bouquet
of
roses,
and
Vayne
herself
is
reading
a
macaroni
card
made
by
him.
In
its
Chinese
artwork,
Jack
of
Hearts
Twisted
Fate
can
be
seen
in
the
background.
Relations
There
is
speculation
that
Vayne
is
secretly
investigating
the
activities
of
LeBlanc
and
the
Black

organization.

Orianna
has
two
different
emote
animations
depending
on
if
The
Ball
is
attached
to
her
or
not.
Orianna&#x27;s
automaton
concept

strikingly

to
Olimpia,
a
<b>character</b>
in
E.T.A.
Hoffmann
&#x27;s     ... 
of

Mac
Version
of
League
of
Legends.
Quotes
Orianna&#x27;s
joke
&quot;When
you
fall,
you
get
right
back
up.&quot;
coincides
with
Aigis
&#x27;
line.
Aigis
is
a
female
robot
<b>character</b>
from
the
game
Persona
3
who
says     ... 
these
words
when
she
is
hit
by
an
attack
she
is
weak
against.
The
quote
&quot;I
know
what
makes
them
tick.
I
know
how
to
make
the
ticking
stop.&quot;
is
a
paraphrased
reference
to
the
<b>character</b>
Sylar

Trivia
Orianna
was
developed
by
Xypherous
.
[1]
Orianna
is
voiced
by
Heather
Pennington.
Orianna
bears
some
similarities
to
GLaDOS
from
the
Portal
series,
both
in
voice
acting
and
in
personality.
The
word
&quot;Orianna&quot;
is
a
European
name
and
has
a
few
possible
origins.
They
all
seem
to
refer
to
the
&quot;golden
color
of
the
sun&quot;:
&quot;Orianna&quot;
is
the
Irish
meaning
of
&quot;Blonde&quot;
or
&quot;Golden&quot;.
The
name
may
also
be
from
the
medieval
Spanish
and
Portuguese
word
&quot;Oroana/Ouroana&quot;
(which
also
means
&quot;Golden&quot;).
Another
possible
origin
is
from
the
Latin
meaning
of
&quot;Rising&quot;
(as
in,
&quot;Sunrise&quot;).
The
term
&quot;
Clockwork
&quot;
refers
to
the
inner
workings
of
either
a
mechanical
clock
or
a
device
that
operates
in
a
similar
fashion.
Specifically,
a
mechanical
device
utilizing
a
complex
series
of
gears,
such
as
an
automaton
.
Orianna's
Classic
skin
resembles
a
RAcaseal
from
Phantasy
Star
Online
.
Orianna's
title
was
originally
&quot;The
Clockwork
Girl&quot;,
but
was
then
changed
to
&quot;The
Lady
of
Clockwork&quot;
the
night
before
her
release.
This
was
due
to
a
film
that
is
in
the
making
called
&quot;
The
Clockwork
Girl
&quot;.
Orianna
was
inspired
by
Youmu
Konpaku
from
the
Touhou
Project
series.
[2]
Xypherous'
original
concept
for
Orianna
was
based
on
Hong
Meiling
,
also
from
Touhou
Project
.
[3]
Orianna
is
the
second
champion
to
currently
have
a
difficulty
rating
of
100,
the
first
being
Cassiopeia
,
the
third
being
Syndra
,
and
the
fourth
being
Draven
.
Orianna
has
two
different
emote
animations
depending
on
if
The
Ball
is
attached
to
her
or
not.
Orianna's
automaton
concept
and
background
is
strikingly
similar
to
Olimpia,
a
character
in
E.T.A.
Hoffmann
's
The
Sandman
who
is
the
&quot;daughter&quot;
of
an
inventor.
Orianna
bears
resemblance
to
the
ball-jointed
doll
monster
Karakuriko
from
Sailor
Moon
,
the
Super
S
series,
In
her
Champion
Spotlight
,
her
in-game
icon
seems
to
be
walfas-styled
artwork
instead
of
Orianna's
(it
can
be
seen
here
).
A
group
of
miniature
balls
that
belong
to
Orianna
can
be
seen
on
Corporate
Mundo's
desk
in
the
preview
for
the
launch
of
the
Mac
Version
of
League
of
Legends.
Quotes
Orianna's
joke
&quot;When
you
fall,
you
get
right
back
up.&quot;
coincides
with
Aigis
'
line.
Aigis
is
a
female
robot
character
from
the
game
Persona
3
who
says
these
words
when
she
is
hit
by
an
attack
she
is
weak
against.
The
quote
&quot;I
know
what
makes
them
tick.
I
know
how
to
make
the
ticking
stop.&quot;
is
a
paraphrased
reference
to
the
character
Sylar
from
the
now-cancelled
NBC
show
Heroes
,
more
specifically
him
describing
his
super-power
.
This
is
also
a
reference
to
the
Magic
the
Gathering
card
Organ
Grinders
flavor
text.
Skins
Sewn
Chaos
Orianna
could
be
a
reference
to
various
doll
characters
from
the
movies
9
,
The
Nightmare
Before
Christmas
,
or
Coraline
.
In
the
Sewn
Chaos
artwork,
there
are
ragdolls
of
Annie
,
Tibbers
,
and
a
purple
caster
minion
.
Bladecraft
Orianna
bears
resemblance
to
Pris,
a
replicant
from
the
movie
Blade
Runner
.
This
skin
also
bears
resemblance
to
the
character
R.
Dorothy
Wayneright
from
the
anime
The
Big
O
in
that
they
share
a
hairstyle
and
color
scheme.
Both
Orianna
and
Dorothy
are
also
artificial
humans
created
by
their
late
human
counterparts'
fathers
after
their
human
selves'
deaths.
It
also
resemble
to
Malice
(a
sex
doll)
the
prinicpal
character
from
the
Anime
Malice@Doll.
Sewn
Chaos
Orianna
used
to
be
her
original
skin,
until
Riot
changed
it
to
her
current
look
before
release
(
According
to
the
initial
concept
art
).
TPA
Orianna
skin
is
related
to
&quot;
Taipei
Assassins
&quot;,
who
have
won
the
League
of
Legends
Season
2
World
Championship
finals.

Orianna
is
the
second
champion
to
currently
have
a
difficulty
rating
of
100,
the
first
being
Cassiopeia
,
the
third
being
Syndra
,
and
the
fourth
being
Draven
.
Orianna
has
two
different
emote
animations
depending
on
if
The
Ball
is
attached
to
her
or
not.
Orianna's
automaton
concept
and
background
is
strikingly
similar
to
Olimpia,
a
character
in
E.T.A.
Hoffmann
's
The
Sandman
who
is
the
&quot;daughter&quot;
of
an
inventor.
Orianna
bears
resemblance
to
the
ball-jointed
doll
monster
Karakuriko
from
Sailor
Moon
,
the
Super
S
series,
In
her
Champion
Spotlight
,
her
in-game
icon
seems
to
be
walfas-styled
artwork
instead
of
Orianna's
(it
can
be
seen
here
).
A
group
of
miniature
balls
that
belong
to
Orianna
can
be
seen
on
Corporate
Mundo's
desk
in
the
preview
for
the
launch
of
the
Mac
Version
of
League
of
Legends.
Quotes
Orianna's
joke
&quot;When
you
fall,
you
get
right
back
up.&quot;
coincides
with
Aigis
'
line.
Aigis
is
a
female
robot
character
from
the
game
Persona
3
who
says
these
words
when
she
is
hit
by
an
attack
she
is
weak
against.
The
quote
&quot;I
know
what
makes
them
tick.
I
know
how
to
make
the
ticking
stop.&quot;
is
a
paraphrased
reference
to
the
character
Sylar
from
the
now-cancelled
NBC
show
Heroes
,
more
specifically
him
describing
his
super-power
.
This
is
also
a
reference
to
the
Magic
the
Gathering
card
Organ
Grinders
flavor
text.
Skins
Sewn
Chaos
Orianna
could
be
a
reference
to
various
doll
characters
from
the
movies
9
,
The
Nightmare
Before
Christmas
,
or
Coraline
.
In
the
Sewn
Chaos
artwork,
there
are
ragdolls
of
Annie
,
Tibbers
,
and
a
purple
caster
minion
.
Bladecraft
Orianna
bears
resemblance
to
Pris,
a
replicant
from
the
movie
Blade
Runner
.
This
skin
also
bears
resemblance
to
the
character
R.
Dorothy
Wayneright
from
the
anime
The
Big
O
in
that
they
share
a
hairstyle
and
color
scheme.
Both
Orianna
and
Dorothy
are
also
artificial
humans
created
by
their
late
human
counterparts'
fathers
after
their
human
selves'
deaths.
It
also
resemble
to
Malice
(a
sex
doll)
the
prinicpal
character
from
the
Anime
Malice@Doll.
Sewn
Chaos
Orianna
used
to
be
her
original
skin,
until
Riot
changed
it
to
her
current
look
before
release
(
According
to
the
initial
concept
art
).
TPA
Orianna
skin
is
related
to
&quot;
Taipei
Assassins
&quot;,
who
have
won
the
League
of
Legends
Season
2
World
Championship
finals.

Trivia
Fiora
was
designed
by
Volty
.
Fiora
is
voiced
by
Karen
Strassman
,
who
also
voices
Cassiopeia
,
Shyvana
,
Zyra
,
and
Elise
.
Fiora's
sword
fighting
style
is
based
on
fencing
,
and
her
character
concept
is
inspired
by
an
unspecified
historical
French
fencer
,
possibly
Julie
D'Aubigny.
[1]
[2]
Fiora
also
has
a
caricatural
French
accent.
The
name
Fiora
derives
from
&quot;Fiore&quot;,
the
Italian
word
for
&quot;Flower&quot;,
which
may
be
a
reference
to
Fiore
Dei
Liberi,
an
Italian
fencing
master.
&quot;Fioretto&quot;
is
also
Italian
for
one
of
the
three
fencing
disciplines,
namely
the
Foil.
Fiora's
dance
is
a
reference
to
Fred
Astaire's
dance
in
the
movie
Blue
Skies
,
with
the
song
Puttin'
on
the
Ritz
.
A
side-by-side
comparison
can
be
seen
here
.
Fiora's
taunt
animation
is
derived
from
the
&quot;salute&quot;
in
honor
duel
tradition
(retained
in
sports
fencing
today);
where
opponents
would
raise
their
swords
to
each
other
at
the
beginning
and
conclusion
of
a
duel,
bout
or
sparring
session.
Pictures
on
her
Duelist
and
Blade
Waltz
are
not
her
classic
skin,
but
instead
her
Nightraven
skin.
Her
ultimate
is
comparable
to
that
of
Yurnero,
the
Juggernaut
from
DotA
,
which
also
pays
homage
to
Final
Fantasy
VII
main
protagonist
Cloud
Strife's
Ability
'Omnislash'.
All
three
consist
of
dancing
across
the
battlefield
slashing
at
random
targets.
Cloud's
moves
can
be
seen
here
(FF7)
and
here
(CGI
Movie).
Fiora's
Burst
of
Speed
is
very
similar
to
the
Assassin
move
of
the
same
name
in
Diablo
II
,
with
almost
identical
particles
and
effects.
Quotes
Fiora's
quote
&quot;prepare
to
die&quot;
is
likely
a
reference
to
Inigo
Montoya
from
the
movie
The
Princess
Bride
.
His
full
quote:
&quot;Hello.
My
name
is
Inigo
Montoya.
You
killed
my
father.
Prepare
to
die.&quot;
Fiora's
second
taunt
&quot;I
like
you.
I
hate
to
kill
you&quot;
is
also
a
likely
reference
to
Inigo
Montoya.
His
quote:
&quot;You
seem
a
decent
fellow.
I
hate
to
kill
you.&quot;
During
Fiora's
jokes,
she
draws
Teemo's
face
in
the
air.
Relations
Fiora
is
rivals
with
Jax
and
Lux,
Lux
because
of
her
Crownguard
heritage
as
well
as
being
too
optimistic
for
her.
And
Jax
due
to
him
being
one
of
the
finest
fighters
known
in
Runeterra
with
his
unmatched
mastery
of
weapons.
Skins
Royal
Guard
Fiora
is
likely
a
reference
to
the
Musketeers
of
the
Guard
,
a
fighting
company
of
the
French
monarchy.
Royal
Guard
Fiora's
splash
art
is
the
only
one
in
which
she
is
holding
the
blades
in
a
left-handed
fashion,
with
the
rapier
in
her
left-hand
and
a
parrying
dagger
(main-gauche)
in
her
right,
though
the
character
model
for
this
skin
still
has
her
holding
the
rapier
in
her
right-hand.
In
Nightraven
Fiora's
skin,
the
rapier's
hilt
is
based
on
the
Italian
&quot;Swept
Hilt&quot;
design.
Though
all
of
Fiora's
splash
arts
show
her
with
a
parrying
dagger
in
her
off-hand,
none
of
her
character
models
actually
have
her
holding
the
dagger.
In
her
original
animation
for
Riposte
,
Fiora
was
supposed
to
use
her
main-gauche
to
parry
the
oncoming
enemy
attack.
This
animation
was
removed
due
to
it
commonly
having
timing
issues.
Before
the
announcing
of
the
skin
names,
the
Royal
Guard
skin
was
nicknamed
the
Musketeer
skin
and
the
Nightraven
was
nicknamed
the
Zorro
skin
by
the
community.
The
Nightraven
skin
had
a
different
character
model
before
the
final
design
and
was
nicknamed
the
Armoured
skin.
In
the
old
character
model,
the
cape
was
on
the
opposite
shoulder
and
Fiora
had
a
neck
guard.
Headmistress
Fiora
is
a
reference
to
the
clich
most
commonly
occurring
in
American
sitcoms
in
which
a
teacher
would
end
up
being
hugely
attractive
and
would
be
a
flirty
icon
to
either
students
or
parents
or
other
staff.
It
was
a
skin
recommended
by
the
community
and
was
released
for
Harrowing
2012
.
