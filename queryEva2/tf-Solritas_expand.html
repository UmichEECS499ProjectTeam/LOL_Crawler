Notes
The
lowest
base
movement
speed
in
the
game
is
325.
At
this
speed,
Trinity
Force
grants
26
movement
speed.
The
movement
speed
stat
only
increases
flat
movement
speed,
and
will
not
interact
with
other
percentage
increases.
Trinity
Force
is
best
used
on
champions
that
have
some
combination
of
the
following:
One
or
more
low-cooldown
spells
to
trigger
Spellblade
often
(
Udyr
,
Xin
Zhao
).
Ability
to
make
use
of
a
wide
variety
of
champion
statistics
(
Jax
,
Nidalee
).
High
base
attack
damage,
which
Spellblade
amplifies
(
Skarner
).
One
or
more
abilities
that
grant
flat
movement
speed
(
Quinn
).
Difficulty
sticking
to
a
target.
Using
multiple
abilities
in
succession
does
not
result
in
stacking
bonus
damage,
and
the
bonus
damage
does
not
increase
on
a
critical
strike
.
Spellblade
is
a
unique
passive.
However,
if
Iceborn
Gauntlet
is
used
alongside
Lich
Bane
and/or
Trinity
Force
,
it
will
combine
the
slowing
field
of
the
former
with
the
other's
damage
increase.
Lich
Bane
's
proc
will
always
take
priority
over
Trinity
Force
if
both
are
present
in
a
champion's
inventory.
Trinity
Force
procs
Lifesteal.
It
does
not
proc
Spell
Vamp,
however.
Cooldown
start
after
the
proc
is
consumed
(after
the
attack)
not
after
the
spell
is
activated.
Trivia
Trinity
Force
is
one
of
the
only
three
items
that
grants
both
ability
power
and
attack
damage
,
the
others
being
Hextech
Gunblade
and
Guinsoo's
Rageblade
.
Trinity
Force
features
the
most
champion
statistics
in
one
item.
The
highest
damage
possible
from
the
passive
is
260
physical
damage
and
can
be
achieved
with
Cho'Gath
and
Skarner
,
who
both
have
130
base
damage
at
level
18.
The
swords
in
the
icon
clearly
resemble
the
Sheen
item
and
two
swords
in
the
Zeal
item
to
make
the
Trinity
Force
.
Trinity
Force
was
the
most
expensive
item
prior
to
the
V3.10a
patch.
After
this,
the
title
goes
to
the
Infinity
Edge
.
The
Brutalizer
and
Trinity
Force
are
the
only
items
that
have
a
cost
value
not
being
a
multiple
of
5.
The
name
and
icon
for
this
item
were
almost
certainly
inspired
by
&quot;The
Legend
of
Zelda's&quot;
Triforce.
The
Triforce
from
The
Legend
of
Zelda
has
three
pieces:
Power,
Courage,
and
Wisdom.
It
could
also
be
a
reference
to
the
nuclear
bomb
tested
during
World
War
II,
Where
immense
force
was
released
at
Trinity.
Typing
'Tons
of
damage'
into
the
in
the
search
bar
for
the
new
UI
store
finds
the
Trinity
Force
as
a
reference
to
Phreak's
catch-phrase
during
Champion
Showcases
as
well
as
the
meme
that
follows
it.
The
new
&quot;Recommended
Items&quot;
section
of
UI
store
also
displays
&quot;Tons
of
Damage&quot;
as
the
description
for
Trinity
Force
when
shown
as
a
recommended
item
for
a
champion.
It
actually
helps
you
deal
tons
of
damage.

Notes
The
lowest
base
movement
speed
in
the
game
is
325.
At
this
speed,
Trinity
Force
grants
26
movement
speed.
The
movement
speed
stat
only
increases
flat
movement
speed,
and
will
not
interact
with
other
percentage
increases.
Trinity
Force
is
best
used
on
champions
that
have
some
combination
of
the
following:
One
or
more
low-cooldown
spells
to
trigger
Spellblade
often
(
Udyr
,
Xin
Zhao
).
Ability
to
make
use
of
a
wide
variety
of
champion
statistics
(
Jax
,
Nidalee
).
High
base
attack
damage,
which
Spellblade
amplifies
(
Skarner
).
One
or
more
abilities
that
grant
flat
movement
speed
(
Quinn
).
Difficulty
sticking
to
a
target.
Using
multiple
abilities
in
succession
does
not
result
in
stacking
bonus
damage,
and
the
bonus
damage
does
not
increase
on
a
critical
strike
.
Spellblade
is
a
unique
passive.
However,
if
Iceborn
Gauntlet
is
used
alongside
Lich
Bane
and/or
Trinity
Force
,
it
will
combine
the
slowing
field
of
the
former
with
the
other's
damage
increase.
Lich
Bane
's
proc
will
always
take
priority
over
Trinity
Force
if
both
are
present
in
a
champion's
inventory.
Trinity

Lifesteal.
It
does
not
proc
Spell
Vamp,
however.
Cooldown
start
after
the
proc
is
consumed
(after
the
attack)
not
after
the
spell
is
activated.
Trivia
Trinity
Force
is
one
of
the
only
three
items
that
grants
both
ability
power
and
attack
damage
,
the
others
being
Hextech
Gunblade
and
Guinsoo's
Rageblade
.
Trinity
Force
features
the
most
champion
statistics
in
one
item.
The
highest
damage
possible
from
the
passive
is
260
physical
damage
and
can
be
achieved
with
Cho'Gath
and
Skarner
,
who
both
have
130
base
damage
at
level
18.
The
swords
in
the
icon
clearly
resemble
the
Sheen
item
and
two
swords
in
the
Zeal
item
to
make
the
Trinity
Force
.
Trinity
Force
was
the
most
expensive
item
prior
to
the
V3.10a
patch.
After
this,
the
title
goes
to
the
Infinity
Edge
.
The
Brutalizer
and
Trinity
Force
are
the
only
items
that
have
a
cost
value
not
being
a
multiple
of
5.
The
name
and
icon
for
this
item
were
almost
certainly
inspired
by
&quot;The
Legend
of
Zelda's&quot;
Triforce.
The
Triforce
from
The
Legend
of
Zelda
has
three
pieces:
Power,
Courage,
and
Wisdom.
It
could
also
be
a
reference
to
the
nuclear
bomb
tested
during
World
War
II,
Where
immense
force
was
released
at
Trinity.
Typing
'Tons
of
damage'
into
the
in
the
search
bar
for
the
new
UI
store
finds
the
Trinity
Force
as
a
reference
to
Phreak's
catch-phrase
during
Champion
Showcases
as
well
as
the
meme
that
follows
it.
The
new
&quot;Recommended
Items&quot;
section
of
UI
store
also
displays
&quot;Tons
of
Damage&quot;
as
the
description
for
Trinity
Force
when
shown
as
a
recommended
item
for
a
champion.
It
actually
helps
you
deal
tons
of
damage.

Friends
&amp;
Rivals
Champion
Although
born
to
poor
gypsy
parents,
the
champion
known
as
Twisted
Fate
was
able
to
gamble
his
way
to
prosperity
as
a
card
shark
in
the
seedy
underground
gambling
circuits
of
Demacia
and
Noxus
.
No
matter
how
close
the
authorities
came
to
catching
him,
the
rogue
always
found
a
way
to
slip
through
their
fingers.
Despite
his
good
fortune,
he
was
never
able
to
win
that
which
he
truly
desired
-
the
ability
to
control
magic.
When
Twisted
Fate
learned
of
an
experiment
being
conducted
in
Zaun
that
might
help
him
with
his
wish,
he
did
the
only
thing
a
gambler
of
his
worth
could
do
-
he
went
all
in
and
volunteered
for
the
experiment.
Conducted
by
the
infamous
Dr.
Xavier
Rath,
Twisted
Fate
was
told
that
the
wager
for
such
participation
might
be
steep.
He
might
change
forever,
or
nothing
might
happen,
or
he
might
die
horribly.
Pain,
however,
was
likely
a
part
of
the
deal
no
matter
the
outcome.
These
were
hardly
the
worst
odds
the
gambler
had
faced;
his
hopes
raised,
Twisted
Fate
underwent
the
experiment,
enduring
what
he
must
for
a
chance
at
his
dream.
Then,
it
ended
-
with
seemingly
no
effect
whatsoever.
The
gypsy
rogue
flew
into
a
murderous
rage,
but,
before
he
could
strike
down
the
team,
he
suddenly
teleported
himself
miles
away.
With
a
sly
grin,
he
realized
his
luck
had
won
out
yet
again.
He
now
brings
his
luck
and
rakish
charm
to
the
Institute
of
War
,
where
he
is
the
champion
of
choice
for
many
-
especially
the
gambling
kind.
To
this
day,
Twisted
Fate
has
avoided
his
inevitable
reunion
with
Dr.
Rath.
The
Card
Master
knows,
however,
that
a
confrontation
is
coming.
&quot;While
the
future
may
be
mysterious
and
unknown
to
most,
Twisted
Fate
is
certain
that
his
future
lies
within
the
cards.&quot;
The
banks
of
the
Serpentine
River
are
home
to
a
smattering
of
gypsy
communities.
On
any
given
day,
you
can
see
a
flotilla
of
paddleboats
migrating
up
and
down
the
rushing
waters.
Though
their
homes
are
constantly
on
the
move,
their
communities
are
very
stable.
The
Serpentine
gypsies
live
and
die
by
a
single
code:
If
you
are
my
friend,
you
are
my
family.
If
you
are
my
foe,
you
have
made
enemies
of
us
all.
The
most
famous
of
these
gypsies
is
a
man
known
only
as
Twisted
Fate.
In
cards,
no
matter
what
hand
he
is
dealt,
he
always
finds
a
way
to
come
out
on
top.
But
it
isn't
just
his
luck
that
makes
him
so
famous.
Just
ask
anyone
who
has
accused
him
of
cheating.
They'll
tell
you
he
can
kill
a
man
dead
at
twenty
paceswith
nothing
more
than
a
playing
card.

Trivia
Twisted
Fate
was
designed
by
Guinsoo
.
[1]
Twisted
Fate
is
voiced
by
Owen
Thomas
,
Who
also
voices
Viktor
.
Owen
stated
that
he
does
not
remember
giving
his
voice
to
Twisted
Fate
before
being
reminded
by
a
fan.
Twisted
Fate
used
to
come
from
Demacia
before
his
background
was
redone.
Twisted
Fate
is
frequently
compared
to
Gambit
from
the
X-Men
comics
for
his
weapon
of
choice,
throwing
cards,
as
well
as
his
manner
of
speaking.
Twisted
Fate
is
also
comparable
to
the
character
Luxord
from
the
Kingdom
Hearts
role-playing
series
in
his
gentlemanly
attitude
and
inventive
use
of
cards
as
weapons.
Additionally,
both
characters
possess
the
ability
to
disappear
in
a
stream
of
cards
and
reappear
elsewhere.
Twisted
Fate
was
one
of
the
first
six
characters
designed,
along
with
Singed
,
Annie
,
Sivir
,
Sion
and
Lee
Sin
.
[2]
[3]
On
the
artwork
of
many
skins,
the
cards
he
throws
can
be
seen
to
be
Tarot
cards
from
the
Major
Arcana
of
The
Terot
Twisted
Fate's
dance
is
a
reference
to
the
extremely
popular
song
Gangnam
Style
.
A
side-by-side
comparison
can
be
seen
here.
Twisted
Fate
is
the
third
champion
to
feature
vocals
during
his
dance:
the
first
being
Draven
and
the
second
being
Rengar
.
While
not
visible
due
to
the
fixed
camera
angle
in-game,
Twisted
Fate's
eyes
are
completely
cyan
(no
whites
or
pupil).
This
can
be
observed
by
examining
his
model
in
the
games
files,
by
panning
the
camera
in
spectator
mode
,or
by
looking
at
High
Noon
Twisted
Fate's
splash
art.
Skins
The
splash
art
for
PAX
2009
Twisted
Fate
and
The
Magnificent
Twisted
Fate
shows
him
using
Tarot
Cards
.
In
the
Chinese
splash
art,
High
Noon
Twisted
Fate
is
also
using
Tarot
Cards.
Although
The
Magnificent
Twisted
Fate
is
priced
as
a
legendary
skin,
it
has
no
new
particle
effects,
animations
or
dialogue.
The
artwork
for
The
Magnificent
Twisted
Fate
depicts
him
with
a
Fiendish
Codex
hanging
from
his
belt.
PAX
Twisted
Fate
has
the
PAX
logo
displayed
on
his
shoulder,
hat,
and
belt.
Twisted
Fate
and
Evelynn
have
matching
Tango
skins.
In
the
Chinese
artwork,
the
same
art
is
used
for
both
skins,
with
the
only
difference
being
the
position
of
the
spotlight.
The
cards
that
appear
when
Underworld
Twisted
Fate
uses
his
ult
have
the
same
symbol
on
them
that
Gatekeeper
Galio
bears
on
his
arms.
Jack
of
Hearts
Twisted
Fate
bears
a
striking
resemblance
to
the
Red
Mage
class
from
the
Final
Fantasy
series.
This
may
or
may
not
be
intentional.
Underworld
Twisted
Fate
bears
a
remarkable
resemblance
to
the
outfit
worn
by
Jericho
Cross
in
the
video
game
DarkWatch
(see
here
).
It
could
also
be
based
of
Gambit
of
the
X-men's
Horseman
of
Death
outfit
(see
here
)
Relations
Twisted
Fate
and
Evelynn
were
the
first
reported
couple
in
The
Journal
of
Justice,
Issue
1
.
However,
Evelynn
has
reportedly
ended
the
relationship
in
Issue
10
.
Twisted
Fate
and
Graves
were
partners
in
the
past.
That
is
until
Twisted
Fate
sold
out
Graves
to
Dr.
Priggs
in
exchange
for
a
risky
experiment
that
gave
Twisted
Fate
his
magical
abilities.
After
escaping
imprisonment,
Graves
now
seeks
payback
on
Twisted
Fate.
There
is
speculation
that
Twisted
Fate
is
the
cat
burglar
in
which
Caitlyn
is
attempting
to
track
down
and
arrest.
The
bandit,
who
always
leaves
a
card
with
an
ornate
&quot;C&quot;
at
the
scene
of
the
crime,
has
become
Caitlyn's
arch-nemesis.

Trivia
Twisted
Fate
was
designed
by
Guinsoo
.
[1]
Twisted
Fate
is
voiced
by
Owen
Thomas
,
Who
also
voices
Viktor
.
Owen
stated
that
he
does
not
remember
giving
his
voice
to
Twisted
Fate
before
being
reminded
by
a
fan.
Twisted
Fate
used
to
come
from
Demacia
before
his
background
was
redone.
Twisted
Fate
is
frequently
compared
to
Gambit
from
the
X-Men
comics
for
his
weapon
of
choice,
throwing
cards,
as
well
as
his
manner
of
speaking.
Twisted
Fate
is
also
comparable
to
the
character
Luxord
from
the
Kingdom
Hearts
role-playing
series
in
his
gentlemanly
attitude
and
inventive
use
of
cards
as
weapons.
Additionally,
both
characters
possess
the
ability
to
disappear
in
a
stream
of
cards
and
reappear
elsewhere.
Twisted
Fate
was
one
of
the
first
six
characters
designed,
along
with
Singed
,
Annie
,
Sivir
,
Sion
and
Lee
Sin
.
[2]
[3]
On
the
artwork
of
many
skins,
the
cards
he
throws
can
be
seen
to
be
Tarot
cards
from
the
Major
Arcana
of
The
Terot
Twisted
Fate's
dance
is
a
reference
to
the
extremely
popular
song
Gangnam
Style
.
A
side-by-side
comparison
can
be
seen
here.
Twisted
Fate
is
the
third
champion
to
feature
vocals
during
his
dance:
the
first
being
Draven
and
the
second
being
Rengar
.
While
not
visible
due
to
the
fixed
camera
angle
in-game,
Twisted
Fate's
eyes
are
completely
cyan
(no
whites
or
pupil).
This
can
be
observed
by
examining
his
model
in
the
games
files,
by
panning
the
camera
in
spectator
mode
,or
by
looking
at
High
Noon
Twisted
Fate's
splash
art.
Skins
The
splash
art
for
PAX
2009
Twisted
Fate
and
The
Magnificent
Twisted
Fate
shows
him
using
Tarot
Cards
.
In
the
Chinese
splash
art,
High
Noon
Twisted
Fate
is
also
using
Tarot
Cards.
Although
The
Magnificent
Twisted
Fate
is
priced
as
a
legendary
skin,
it
has
no
new
particle
effects,
animations
or
dialogue.
The
artwork
for
The
Magnificent
Twisted
Fate
depicts
him
with
a
Fiendish
Codex
hanging
from
his
belt.
PAX
Twisted
Fate
has
the
PAX
logo
displayed
on
his
shoulder,
hat,
and
belt.
Twisted
Fate
and
Evelynn
have
matching
Tango
skins.
In
the
Chinese
artwork,
the
same
art
is
used
for
both
skins,
with
the
only
difference
being
the
position
of
the
spotlight.
The
cards
that
appear
when
Underworld
Twisted
Fate
uses
his
ult
have
the
same
symbol
on
them
that
Gatekeeper
Galio
bears
on
his
arms.
Jack
of
Hearts
Twisted
Fate
bears
a
striking
resemblance
to
the
Red
Mage
class
from
the
Final
Fantasy
series.
This
may
or
may
not
be
intentional.
Underworld
Twisted
Fate
bears
a
remarkable
resemblance
to
the
outfit
worn
by
Jericho
Cross
in
the
video
game
DarkWatch
(see
here
).
It
could
also
be
based
of
Gambit
of
the
X-men's
Horseman
of
Death
outfit
(see
here
)
Relations
Twisted
Fate
and
Evelynn
were
the
first
reported
couple
in
The
Journal
of
Justice,
Issue
1
.
However,
Evelynn
has
reportedly
ended
the
relationship
in
Issue
10
.
Twisted
Fate
and
Graves
were
partners
in
the
past.
That
is
until
Twisted
Fate
sold
out
Graves
to
Dr.
Priggs
in
exchange
for
a
risky
experiment
that
gave
Twisted
Fate
his
magical
abilities.
After
escaping
imprisonment,
Graves
now
seeks
payback
on
Twisted
Fate.
There
is
speculation
that
Twisted
Fate
is
the
cat
burglar
in
which
Caitlyn
is
attempting
to
track
down
and
arrest.
The
bandit,
who
always
leaves
a
card
with
an
ornate
&quot;C&quot;
at
the
scene
of
the
crime,
has
become
Caitlyn's
arch-nemesis.

usage
Due
to
Wild
Cards
having
one
of
the
highest
non-global
non-ultimate
range
in-game,
he
can
harass
very
well.
This
makes
him
a
good
pick
for
mid
lane.
While
the
projectiles
are
slow
moving,
the
long
range
of
the
cards
often
catch
enemies
by
surprise.
Additionally,
the
projectiles,
unlike
many
skillshots
and
pokes,
will
pass
through
minions,
and
even
do
damage
as
multiple
targets
are
passed.
This
disallows
opponents
from
blocking
with
their
waves.
With
some
ability
power,
using
Red
Card
and
Wild
Cards
on
a
wave
of
minions
makes
Twisted
Fate

unrivaled

pushing
and
clearing
quickly.
Use
this
to
gank
other
lanes
with
Destiny
,
as
your
minions
will
be
pushed
up
to
ensure
your
turret

until
you

it.
You
may
also
attempt

set
yourself
up
for
harassing
them

utilities.
Blue
Card
can
help
Twisted
Fate
stay
in
lane
longer
as
he
regains
mana
back
more
quickly.
Gold
Card
is
very
useful
when
chasing
down
an
enemy
or
when
ganking
since
it
stuns
the
enemy
it
hits.
Red
Card
can
help
Twisted
Fate
push,
farm,
gank,
or
chase
down
an
enemy
because
it
deals
splash
damage
and
slows
the
targets
hit.
The
area
of
effect
of
Red
Card
may
also
be
a
more
useful
effect
for
peeling
allies
and
kiting
enemies
than
Gold
Card
if
it
can
hit
multiple
targets,
especially
when
teams
are
fighting
in
the
tight
spaces
of
the
jungle
or
at
lower
levels
when
the
duration
of
Gold
Card
will
be
much
lower
than
the
duration
of
Red
Card
The
three
different
cards
in
Pick
a
Card
are
in
a
set
rotation.
Blue
Card
,
then
Red
Card
,
then
Gold
Card
,
and
it
repeats;
the
starting
card
may
differ
each
time
you
use
Pick
a
Card
,
but
it
will
always
follow
that
rotation.
This
rotation
is
very
important
to
allow
you
to
predict
the
time
it
will
take
for
you
to
lock
in
a
card
and
throw
it.
The
card
last
chosen
can
be
the
first
card
available
when
Pick
a
Card
is
available
again.
Despite
locking
a
specific
card,
the
ability
will
still
cycle
the
card
rotation
every
time
the
card
above
Twisted
Fate
pulsates.
Thus,
if
you
throw
the
desired
card
immediately
after
locking
it
before
it
has
a
chance
to
pulsate
again,
or
every
three
pulses
after
locking
it,
the
next
card
will
be
the
one
you
last
locked.
Even
if
you
will
not
manage
to
immediately
grab
the
exact
same
card,
counting
the
beats
after
the
card
you
chose
can
still
tip
you
off
toward
grabbing
the
same
card
again
from
the
current
card
for
the
next
time
you
activate
the
ability.
Twisted
Fate
is
relatively
fragile
(squishy)
so
make
sure
you
keep
your
distance.
Twisted
Fate
is
capable
of
repeatedly
stunning
one
opponent
(with
Gold
Card
)
or
slowing
multiple
opponents
(with
Red
Card
)
every
few
seconds,
even
more
often
with
cooldown
reduction
.
Abuse
this
while
chasing,
ganking
and
escaping
pursuers.
The
abilities
of
Twisted
Fate
may
have
low
cooldowns,
but
an
ability
power-focused
Twisted
Fate
is
nonetheless
highly
vulnerable
while
his
abilities
cooldown.
Avoid
committed
fights
against
enemies
with
a
current
health
count
that
you
can't
easily
burst
down
with
Pick
a
Card
and
Wild
Cards
,
as
AP
Twisted
Fate
will
almost
certainly
lose
to
them.
Destiny
and
Gate
can
be
used
to
quickly
backdoor
enemy
structures.
Used
in
conjunction
with
another
great
backdoor
ability,
Pick
a
Card
,
as
the
bonus
damage
is
applied
to
turrets
,
it's
pretty
difficult
for
enemies
to
defend.
Picking
Stacked
Deck
as
your
first
ability
can
lead
to
a
large
amount
of
single
target
damage,
combined
with
attack
speed
runes,
it
is
a
very
good
way
to
get
first
blood
.
However,
Gold
Card
helps
greatly,
and
so
waiting
until
you
are
level
2
can
give
you
better
chances
of
a
kill.
Map
awareness
is
key
to
proper
use
of
Destiny
.
Look
around
the
map
carefully
while
farming
or
traveling
for
potential
foes.
Be
sure
to
ping
onto
targets
just
in
case
your
allies
don't
have
the
same
map
awareness
as
you
do
when
you
plan
to
use
it!
Twisted
Fate
using
Gate
against
a
sole
target
is
unlikely
to
work
well
while
the
cooldown
of
Destiny
is
fairly
long
for
a
lot
of
the
game.
When
a
team
fight
occured
and
you
already
casted
the
Destiny
at
wrong
timing,
position
or
your
team
mates
eliminated,
it
can
be
interrupted
using
Zhonya's
Hourglass
.
It
is
generally
a
good
plan
to
have
a
card
already
chosen
by
Pick
a
Card
before
using
Destiny
,
especially
if
you're
going
to
land
close
to
your
enemy.
You
should
lock
onto
Gold
Card
and
then
activate
Destiny
and
its
secondary
effect,
Gate
,
to
gank
an
enemy.
You
can
also
use
Pick
a
Card
while
channeling
Gate
,
allowing
for
a
faster
Gate
due
to
not
having
to
spend
time
locking
onto
Gold
Card
.
Make
sure
not
to
use
Pick
a
Card
too
early
either,
as
having
your
Gold
Card
run
out
as
you
Gate
will
lead
to
embarrassment
and
likely
a
fruitless
death.
Keep
in
mind
that
Destiny
will
pop
your
enemy's
Banshee's
Veil
but
this
will
also
prevent
him/her
from
being
revealed
by
your
ultimate
(you
can
still
use
Gate
though).
Meaning
that
against
a
team
with
multiple
Veils,
you
can
use
Destiny
to
pop
their
shields
before
a
big
teamfight.
Be
warned
that
fleeing
low-health
enemies
will
likely
be
guarded
by
their
allies
that
remain
invisible
to
your
ultimate
(and
you
will
only
know
it
after
teleporting
to
kill
them
and
be
ganked
yourself).
Coordinate
with
your
allies
for
the
best
time
to
use
Destiny
to
ambush
enemies.
In
a
pinch,
try
to
either
juke
your
enemy
and
then
run
into
a
bush,
or
stun
them
with
Gold
Card
.
If
successful,
pop
your
ultimate
and
start
teleporting
away
with
Gate
.
By
the
time
the
enemy
has
a
chance
to
attack
you
again,
you
should
be
a
safe
distance
away.
This
technique
can
even
work
out
in
the
open
without
Gold
Card
if
you
wait
for
the
enemy
to
pop
all
their
crowd
control
first.
Twisted
Fate
's
primary
combo
to
harass
is
to
activate
Gold
Card
with
full
Stacked
Deck
stacks,
walk
into
attack
range
and
stun
the
enemy,
then
follow
it
up
with
Wild
Cards
and
walk
away
while
the
enemy
tries
to
dodge
the
attack.
Twisted
Fate
can
then
use
Blue
Card
to
last
hit
while
regenerating
mana
and
do
the
combo
all
over
again.
This
combo
is
not
foolproof
because
enemies
will
realize
when
Twisted
Fate
activates
Pick
a
Card
and
be
prepared
to
fall
back,
or
even
use
Twisted
Fate
's
short
autoattack-range
for
applying
the
effects
of
Pick
a
Card
to
easily
predict
where
he
will
have
to
walk
to
use
it
to
set
up
skillshots.
Stacked
Deck
gains
a
stack
for
each
autoattack
and
deals
extra
damage
on
the
fourth
hit,
but
Pick
a
Card
will
vary
this
depending
on
the
scenario.
If
Twisted
Fate
has
his
at
least
one
point
in
each
his
Pick
a
Card
and
Stacked
Deck
and
throws
a
card
modified
by
Pick
a
Card
,
different
things
may
happen.
If
Pick
a
Card
would
kill
it's
target
on
its
own,
then
the
Stacked
Deck
buff
is
not
consumed
or
given
another
stack.
If
the
attack
is
not
strong
enough
to
kill
its
target
with
only
Pick
a
Card
,
then
the
Stacked
Deck
buff
will
be
consumed,
and
deal
extra
magic
damage,
or
given
a
stack.
Build
usage
Twisted
Fate
is
mainly
built
as
an
ability
power
caster.
However,
he
can
also
be
itemized
for
either
attack
damage
or
a
hybrid
mix.
Ability
Power
If
using
an
ability
power
build,
Lich
Bane
is
a
great
choice
due
to
the
ability
power
ratios
of
Twisted
Fate
being
fairly
low
and
will
not
cause
very
much
burst
damage
on
their
own
later
in
the
game.
Additionally,
the
conjunction
with
Pick
a
Card
ensures
in
large
damage
with
one
attack.
Rabadon's
Deathcap
is
mandatory
for
Twisted
Fate
,
as
with
all
AP
mid
laners.
However,
the
passive
makes
it
more
viable
as
a
second
or
third
item,
when
other
items
have
been
purchased
and
some
AP
have
been
amassed.
Zhonya's
Hourglass
is
great
for
AP
Twisted
Fate
.
It
provides
a
significant
amount
of
ability
power
to
scale
with
Rabadon's
Deathcap
and
Lich
Bane
.
The
armor
will
likely
be
helpful
as
the
short
range
of
Pick
a
Card
makes
it
likely
Twisted
Fate
will
take
some
autoattacks
if
stunning
enemy
ranged
champions.
The
stasis
active
will
also
give
a
short
grace
period
to
wait
for
ability
cooldowns
and
to
avoid
incoming
damage.
Deathfire
Grasp
is
highly
useful
on
AP
Twisted
Fate
as
it
gives
him
an
additional
part
to
his
minuscule
burst,
which
as
mentioned
above
tends
to
decline
late
game.
Remember
to
use
the
active
at
the
beginning
of
your
combo
to
amplify
all
subsequent
magic
damage.
Twin
Shadows
is
a
commonly
purchased
item
on
Twisted
Fate
.
It
provides
magic
resist
,
ability
power
,
and
incredible
chasing
capabilities
with
its
active
and
the
movement
speed
bonus.
It
allows
catching
up
to
enemies
and
getting
in
range
for
Gold
Card
.
Nashor's
Tooth
is
also
invaluable,
as
AP,
Attack
Speed,
and
CDR
are
all
very
helpful,
and
the
passive
works
well
with
Stacked
Deck
and
Pick
a
Card
.

Countering
Twisted
Fate
is
relatively
fragile
at
early
game,
putting
an
aggressive
pressure
on
the
lane
can
make
him
underleveled
or
underfarmed.
Twisted
Fate
has
fairly
poor
sustained
damage
with
an
AP
build
-
if
you
can
get
movement-affecting
crowd
control
on
him
before
he
stuns
you
as
a
champion
with
a
greater
sustained
damage
potential,
you
may
be
able
to
turn
the
trade
in
your
favour.
As
Twisted
Fate
has
no
escapes
(besides
Gate
)
and
relies
on
either
Red
Card
or
Gold
Card
to
keep
enemies
away
from
him,
focusing
him
as
a
team
is
very
difficult
for
Twisted
Fate
to
personally
deal
with.
While
Wild
Cards
has
a
nearly
unmatched
range
that
makes
stopping
Twisted
Fate
from
farming
while
he
has
mana
to
cast
it
impossible,
you
can
harass
him
when
he
uses
Blue
Card
as
it's
limited
to
the
range
of
his
basic
attacks.
The
Wild
Cards
can
be
tricky
to
dodge
as
it
travels
in
3
lines
and
moves
a
long
distance.
Instead
of
going
back,
try
to
sidestep
the
spell.
Take
care
when
Twisted
Fate
uses
his
Pick
a
Card
.
When
he
uses
a
Red
Card
,
move
away
from
your
allies
to
avoid
getting
slowed
by
it.
When
he
uses
a
Gold
Card
,
try
to
dodge
from
him
until
the
spell
wears
off.
It's
better
to
save
your
channeled
abilities
until
Twisted
Fate
uses
his
Gold
Card
or
Pick
a
Card
.
When
you
are
under
the
effect
of
Destiny
,
be
prepared
for
a
gank
as
his
Gate
allows
him
to
teleport
to
a
huge
range
in
the
map.
Gate
has
a
noticeable
channeling
with
a
marked
location
-
this
can
leave
him
an
easy
target
for
skillshots.
If
the
skillshots
apply
crowd
control,
this
can
stop
Twisted
Fate
from
getting
you
killed
-
or
maybe
even
turn
the
gank
onto
him!
Dashes
and
blinks,
if
saved,
may
allow
you
to
avoid
Gold
Card
if
used
while
Twisted
Fate
is
teleporting
to
a
location
on
top
of
you.

       Although born to poor gypsy parents, the champion known as Twisted Fate was able to gamble his way to prosperity as a card shark in the seedy underground gambling circuits of Demacia and Noxus. No matter how close the authorities came to catching him, the rogue always found a way to slip through their fingers. Despite his good fortune, he was never able to win that which he truly desired - the ability to control magic. When Twisted Fate learned of an experiment being conducted in Zaun that might help him with his wish, he did the only thing a gambler of his worth could do - he went all in and volunteered for the experiment. Conducted by the infamous Dr. Xavier Rath, Twisted Fate was told that the wager for such participation might be steep. He might change forever, or nothing might happen, or he might die horribly. Pain, however, was likely a part of the deal no matter the outcome. These were hardly the worst odds the gambler had faced; his hopes raised, Twisted Fate underwent the experiment, enduring what he must for a chance at his dream. Then, it ended - with seemingly no effect whatsoever. The gypsy rogue flew into a murderous rage, but, before he could strike down the team, he suddenly teleported himself miles away. With a sly grin, he realized his luck had won out yet again. He now brings his luck and rakish charm to the Institute of War, where he is the Champion of choice for many - especially the gambling kind. To this day, Twisted Fate has avoided his inevitable reunion with Dr. Rath. The Card Master knows, however, that a confrontation is coming. While the future may be mysterious and unknown to most, Twisted Fate is certain that his future lies within the cards.

the
ability
to
control
magic.
When
Twisted
Fate
learned
of
an
experiment
being
conducted
in
Zaun
that
might
help
him
with
his
wish,
he
did
the
only
thing
a
gambler
of
his
worth
could
do
-
he
went
all
in
and
volunteered
for
the
experiment.
Conducted
by
the
infamous
Dr.
Xavier
Rath,
Twisted
Fate
was
told
that
the
wager
for
such
participation
might
be
steep.
He
might
change
forever,
or
nothing
might
happen,
or
he
might
die
horribly.
Pain,
however,
was
likely
a
part
of
the
deal
no
matter
the
outcome.
These
were
hardly
the
worst
odds
the
gambler
had
faced;
his
hopes
raised,
Twisted
Fate
underwent
the
experiment,
enduring
what
he
must
for
a
chance
at
his
dream.
Then,
it
ended
-
with
seemingly
no
effect
whatsoever.
The
gypsy
rogue
flew
into
a
murderous
rage,
but,
before
he
could
strike
down
the
team,
he
suddenly
teleported
himself
miles
away.
With
a
sly
grin,
he
realized
his
luck
had
won
out
yet
again.
He
now
brings
his
luck
and
rakish
charm
to
the
Institute
of
War
,
where
he
is
the
champion
of
choice
for
many
-
especially
the
gambling
kind.
To
this
day,
Twisted
Fate
has
avoided
his
inevitable
reunion
with
Dr.
Rath.
The
Card
Master
knows,
however,
that
a
confrontation
is
coming.
&quot;While
the
future
may
be
mysterious
and
unknown
to
most,
Twisted
Fate
is
certain
that
his
future
lies
within
the
cards.&quot;
The
banks
of
the
Serpentine
River
are
home
to
a
smattering
of
gypsy
communities.
On
any
given
day,
you
can
see
a
flotilla
of
paddleboats
migrating
up
and
down
the
rushing
waters.
Though
their
homes
are
constantly
on
the
move,
their
communities
are
very
stable.
The
Serpentine
gypsies
live
and
die
by
a
single
code:
If
you
are
my
friend,
you
are
my
family.
If
you
are
my
foe,
you
have
made
enemies
of
us
all.
The
most
famous
of
these
gypsies
is
a
man
known
only
as
Twisted
Fate.
In
cards,
no
matter
what
hand
he
is
dealt,
he
always
finds
a
way
to
come
out
on
top.
But
it
isn't
just
his
luck
that
makes
him
so
famous.
Just
ask
anyone
who
has
accused
him
of
cheating.
They'll
tell
you
he
can
kill
a
man
dead
at
twenty
paceswith
nothing
more
than
a
playing
card.
