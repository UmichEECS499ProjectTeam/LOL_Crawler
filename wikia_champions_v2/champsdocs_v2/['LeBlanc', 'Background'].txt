Lore
Every
city
has
its
dark
side,
even
one
whose
reputation
is
already
of
a
questionable
hue.
Noxus
-
though
its
name
is
already
invoked
with
a
mixture
of
reverence
and
revulsion
-
is
no
exception
to
this
simple
truth.
Deep
within
the
winding
dungeons
that
honeycomb
the
earth
beneath
its
dark,
meandering
streets
lies
the
real
underbelly
of
this
sprawling
metropolis,
a
haven
for
all
manner
of
malevolence.
Amongst
the
cults,
covens,
and
secret
societies
that
call
this
labyrinth
their
home,
LeBlanc,
the
Deceiver,
presides
over
the
Black
Rose,
a
remnant
from
a
lost,
yet
similarly
unscrupulous
time
in
Noxian
history.
Ruthless
and
seemingly
ageless,
LeBlanc
and
her
ilk
were
a
mainstay
in
Noxian
political
affairs
during
the
era
before
the
militarization
of
the
Noxian
government.
In
those
days,
this
guild
of
powerful
magicians
met
in
secret
to
further
their
hidden
agenda,
and
to
hone
a
craft
more
subtle
than
that
preferred
by
those
currently
in
power.
While
their
exact
motives
have
always
remained
mysterious,
it
was
widely
believed
that
the
Black
Rose
was
the
true
power
behind
the
throne
while
the
aristocracy
still
reigned
in
Noxus.
When
raw
martial
prowess
became
the
ultimate
determination
of
whose
will
held
sway
in
the
Empire,
the
Black
Rose
seemed
to
vanish
overnight.
Many
believed
that
perhaps
their
time
had
simply
passed,
and
that
its
members
had
put
aside
their
quests
for
social
and
political
dominance.
When
LeBlanc
reemerged
at
the
gates
of
the
Institute
of
War
,
however,
it
became
clear
that
these
masters
of
shadow
and
flame
had
simply
been
biding
their
time,
waiting
for
a
new
global
authority
to
emerge:
the
League
of
Legends
.
"The
world
is
very
different
for
those
who
cannot
see
beyond
what
is
placed
before
their
very
eyes."
―
LeBlanc,
the
Deceiver

CLE
OBSERVATION
LeBlanc's
measured
strides
carry
her
along
the
polished
marble
with
unparalleled
grace
and
decorum.
Her
ornate
magician's
garb,
stylish
and
well-kept,
lends
her
a
stately
appearance
seldom
seen
outside
of
a
royal
court.
In
her
delicate
hands
she
clasps
a
long
staff
topped
with
a
series
of
multi-faceted
crystals
suspended
by
an
unknown
force.
Pinned
in
her
lustrous
hair
sits
another
such
crystal,
scattering
the
torchlight
in
all
directions
as
she
passes.
She
comes
to
a
halt
in
front
of
an
ornate
door,
taking
a
moment
to
peruse
the
inscription.
"The
truest
opponent
lies
within,"
she
reads
whimsically.
The
irony
curls
the
edges
of
her
lips
to
a
brief
smirk,
but
only
for
an
instant.
A
moment
later,
her
face
is
implacable
once
more;
an
emotionless
puzzle,
but
still
captivatingly
beautiful.
She
reaches
out
a
single
perfectly
manicured
hand,
easily
parting
the
doors
despite
their
obvious
weight.
She
peers
for
a
moment
into
the
oppressive
blackness
before
taking
even
strides
into
the
murk.
REFLECTION
The
darkness
grew
cold.
She
pulled
the
robe
close
about
her
to
ward
off
the
chill,
suppressing
a
slight
shiver.
A
cowled
figure
shuffled
by
with
a
hooded
lantern
in
its
hands.
In
the
dim
lamplight
she
could
make
out
the
stones
and
mortar
on
either
side.
Water
was
dripping
somewhere
further
off,
and
the
stink
of
mildew
filled
her
nostrils.
Another
shadowy
figure
shambled
by
her,
part
of
a
procession.
Falling
in
behind
the
rest
of
her
ilk,
LeBlanc
took
a
moment
to
examine
herself.
Draped
over
her
traditional
court
finery
was
a
jet
black
cloak,
bound
with
an
onyx
black
rose.
Her
staff
was
gone,
as
was
the
brooch
in
her
hair.
Ahead,
the
tunnel
broadened
into
a
chamber,
and
she
could
see
a
crowd
forming
in
the
darkness.
LeBlanc
pushed
her
way
through
to
the
front.
The
crowd
parted
before
her
and
she
gasped.
There,
in
the
middle
of
the
throng
of
onlookers,
she
stood
face
to
face
with
herself.
Well,
herself
in
a
manner
of
speaking.
The
situation
was
instantly
familiar,
and
she
waited
patiently
for
her
moment
to
come.
One
of
the
hooded
onlookers
stepped
forward,
addressing
the
doppelganger.
"LeBlanc,"
he
rasped
to
the
woman
at
the
center
of
the
circle,
"Why
have
you
summoned
us?
These
are
dangerous
times
for
the
Black
Rose
to
meet
in
numbers."
The
woman
opened
her
mouth
to
speak,
but
a
sharp
wheeze
cut
her
short.
She
snatched
an
embroidered
handkerchief,
speckled
in
blood,
from
the
folds
of
her
dress
and
used
it
to
stifle
a
cough.
She
cleared
her
throat.
"Brothers
and
sisters,"
she
spoke
weakly,
"I
have
summoned
you
because
I
am
old,
and
I
have
grown
frail.
I
shall
be
one
with
the
earth
soon."
She
smiled,
"The
time
has
come
for
me
to
abdicate
my
position
as
Matron
of
the
society."
She
coughed
again,
louder
this
time.
"There
is
one
among
you
who
has
shown
great
promise
and
leadership,"
she
continued,
"One
whose
talents
are
outstripped
only
by
her
ambition
and
loyalty."
She
plucked
the
sparkling
brooch
from
her
hair,
and
the
illusion
fell
away.
Her
porcelain
skin
turned
ashen,
her
hair
thin
and
stringy,
and
her
eyes
sunken.
She
extended
a
wrinkled
hand
towards
LeBlanc,
"Evaine,
step
forward
and
be
recognized."
LeBlanc
stepped
forward,
accepting
the
bauble
and
nestling
it
into
her
neatly
styled
hair.
Her
predecessor
offered
her
the
staff.
"Strange,"
remarked
the
old
woman,
"It's
like
looking
in
the
mirror."
LeBlanc
accepted
the
staff,
and
the
scene
about
her
fell
away.
A
moment
later
she
was
sitting
in
her
study,
the
staff
cradled
delicately
in
the
crook
of
her
elbow
as
she
sipped
tea
from
an
ornate
cup.
Across
from
her
sat
a
decrepit
figure,
his
fragile
body
enveloped
in
a
tightly
pulled
military
garb.
A
large
raven
sat
perched
on
his
shoulder.
"To
what
do
I
owe
the
pleasure
of
this
visitation,
Jericho
Swain?"
she
asked.
Swain's
crooked
hand
curled
around
the
handle
of
his
teacup
and
he
put
the
steaming
hot
beverage
to
his
lips.
"Exquisite,"
he
rasped.
"Matron
LeBlanc,
you
have
always
had
impeccable
taste."
"I
have,"
she
agreed
with
a
smile;
but
there
was
only
sadness
in
it.
She
stretched
an
arm
across
the
table,
clasping
his
scarred
hand
in
hers.
"But
then,
you
already
knew
that.
You
knew
it
before
you
sold
yourself."
Swain
pressed
a
thorned
onyx
ring
into
her
hand.
"It
is
true.
I
have
made
sacrifices.
But
I
made
them
for
us.
The
Black
Rose
is
yours,
Matron,
but
I
have
become
something
greater."
As
if
in
agreement,
the
raven
on
his
shoulder
cawed.
"The
time
has
come.
Join
me
in
fellowship,
and
we
can
restore
what
was
taken
from
us
by
Boram
Darkwill."
She
gazed
at
the
ring,
"You
have
forsaken
your
identity
to
gain
Darkwill's
trust.
The
rest
will
not
be
so
eager."
"Perhaps.
But
there
are
other
ways,"
Swain
continued.
A
porter
arrived
in
the
doorway
to
announce
an
additional
guest.
"General
Du
Couteau
is
here
to
see
you,
Matron."
LeBlanc
shot
Swain
a
curious
glance.
"Send
him
up,"
she
replied.
The
porter
exited
the
study.
"Du
Couteau
is
that
vulgar
General's
lapdog,"
she
spat.
"He
will
be
of
no
use
to
us,
Jericho."
"Perhaps
you're
mistaken,
Deceiver.
He
is
of
noble
blood,"
said
Swain.
LeBlanc
held
up
the
ring.
"But
he
is
not
one
of
us!"
Swain
nodded.
"Why
do
you
want
to
join
the
League,
LeBlanc?"
"I
mean
to
reclaim
my
people's
birthright,"
she
proclaimed,
flames
burning
in
her
eyes,
"And
believe
me.
I
shall
succeed."
Jericho
Swain
got
up
from
the
table
and
gently
caressed
her
face.
"How
does
it
feel,
exposing
your
mind?"
LeBlanc
threw
back
her
head
and
laughed.
"You
think
that
I'm
exposed,
summoner?"
she
jeered.
"You
will
never
know
LeBlanc.
She
is
far
older
than
I.
She
is
older
than
your
precious
League."
Swain
nodded.
The
doors
before
her
flew
open,
leaving
her
alone
in
the
light.
The
League
of
Legends
awaited
her.

Sneak
Peek
Announcement
made
in
the
sneak
peak
by
ByronicHero
:
LeBlanc
concept
If
you’ve
been
looking
to
add
a
little
bit
of
high
society
to
your
League
of
Legends
lineup,
this
next
patch
is
the
one
you’ve
been
waiting
for.
Allow
me
to
introduce
the
talented
and
graceful
Emilia
LeBlanc,
a
stately
sorceress
ready
to
round
out
your
champion
selection.
In
addition
to
being
extremely
attractive,
the
Deceiver
comes
primed
to
fuel
your
most
megalomaniacal
of
desires.
If
you've
got
a
bit
of
mischievous
thread
to
your
personality,
you're
definitely
going
to
want
to
make
sure
to
pick
up
LeBlanc
in
the
upcoming
patch.
Would
I
lie?
