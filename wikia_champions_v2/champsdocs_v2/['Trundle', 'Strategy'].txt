Skill
usage
King's
Tribute
allows
Trundle
to
jungle
effectively
as
well
as
keep
a
sustained
presence
in
lane.
King's
Tribute
has
a
range
of
1000
and
allows
Trundle
to
heal
from
enemy
minion
waves
as
they
die
even
if
you
can't
last-hit
them.
You
can
use
the
range
of
Pillar
of
Ice
to
find
out
the
maximum
range
of
the
King's
Tribute
.
The
heal
from
King's
Tribute
also
helps
in
a
team
fight.
As
enemies
around
Trundle
die,
he
is
healed.
Although
the
heal
per
enemy
is
not
that
much,
it
does
stack
up
nicely.
Chomp
resets
the
attack
timer.
Learn
to
bite
right
after
you
attack
for
a
double
hit.
Remember
that
it
also
has
a
slight
range
and
can
be
used
to
lunge
towards
an
enemy
if
they
are
outside
of
his
autoattack
range.
Chomp
is
good
for
lowering
the
physical
damage
of
enemies;
try
to
focus
it
on
enemy
physical
damage
dealers.
When
facing
multiple
melee
enemies
you
may
want
to
bite
each
one
every
8
seconds
to
keep
the
AD
debuff
active.
It
can
also
be
used
to
pop
the
opposing
tank's
Banshee's
Veil
before
using
your
Subjugate
.
Early
game,
Trundle
can
easily
outdamage
DPS
champions
in
terms
of
attack
damage
with
his
Chomp
.
Trundle
excels
at
fighting
within
his
Frozen
Domain
.
Try
to
draw
enemies
onto
it.
If
you
are
having
trouble
escaping
or
chasing
champions,
Frozen
Domain
gives
you
bonus
movement
speed
so
you
can
drop
it
out
in
front
to
help
chase
fleeing
enemies
or
speed
your
escape.
Since
Frozen
Domain
has
a
wide
radius
and
fairly
short
cooldown,
you
can
use
the
movement
speed
it
grants
to
move
quickly
from
pack
to
pack
in
the
jungle
by
dropping
it
in
the
proper
location.
Spamming
Frozen
Domain
will
allow
you
to
reach
your
destination
much
faster
but
know
that
Trundle
has
a
very
limited
mana
pool
and
spamming
will
surely
deplete
it.
Frozen
Domain
should
always
be
used
when
attacking
a
tower
for
the
attack
speed
increase.
Place
it
so
that
most
of
the
affected
area
is
behind
you
so
that
you
can
quickly
run
away
from
an
approaching
champion.
Trundle's
Pillar
of
Ice
is
his
signature
strength
and
has
many
various
uses.
Pillar
of
Ice
may
not
be
big
enough
to
block
off
a
lane
or
a
passage
in
the
jungle,
but
if
used
effectively,
a
Trundle
can
make
other
champions
have
to
walk
around
it
in
order
to
get
to
you,
giving
Trundle
time
to
escape
or
to
chase.
A
good
tactic
to
keep
people
on
Frozen
Domain
is
to
plant
a
Pillar
of
Ice
on
the
escaping
champion
which
will
then
push
them
backwards
if
placed
correctly,
allowing
Trundle
to
get
in
range
to
attack.
Pillar
of
Ice
can
move
any
player
if
placed
close
to
him.
It
can
now
cancel
any
channeling
spell
that
requires
to
stand
still
like
Nether
Grasp
,
Infinite
Duress
,
Death
Lotus
or
even
Recall
.
Pillar
of
Ice
has
a
large
sight
radius
and
is
very
effective
to
check
the
brush
and
slow
any
potential
sneaky
gankers.
Pillar
of
Ice
can
be
used
defensively
or
offensively
near
towers.
Defensively,
underneath
your
own
tower,
place
the
pillar
slightly
away
from
your
tower
when
it
is
being
attacked.
The
enemy
will
have
to
brave
the
slow,
a
Chomp
,
and
possible
tower
shot
(if
they
retaliate),
just
to
hit
your
tower.
Offensively,
underneath
an
enemy
tower,
place
the
pillar
next
to
their
tower
when
attacking
it
and
they
will
have
trouble
chasing
you
away
without
being
slowed.
Be
careful
when
using
this
under
an
enemy
tower,
because
it
draws
turret
aggro
when
an
enemy
champion
touches
it.
Dropping
Trundle's
Pillar
of
Ice
to
separate
the
enemy
team
offers
some
of
the
best
counter
initiation
as
well
as
initiation
in
the
game.
If
you
find
an
enemy
out
of
position,
a
well
placed
Pillar
of
Ice
can
block
off
his
or
her
escape,
if
somehow
that
enemy
doesn't
have
Flash
,
as
well
as
keeping
enemy
reinforcements
from
entering
the
battle.
Understanding
when
to
use
Pillar
of
Ice
for
either
purpose
is
important,
as
once
it's
gone,
it's
gone
forever.
Pillar
of
Ice
can
also
save
a
teammate
from
focus
by
preventing
enemies
from
crossing
the
terrain
or
once
an
enemy
has
initiated
on
a
teammate,
Pillar
of
Ice
can
block
reinforcements
from
entering
battle
for
a
while,
giving
your
team
a
little
5
on
1
quiet
time
with
the
initiator
alone.
Combining
this
tactic
with
Trundle's
Subjugate
can
quickly
dispatch
an
enemy,
making
the
team
fight
effectively
a
5
v
4.
Creating
new
impassable
terrain
over
a
champion
(whether
it
is
a
friendly
of
enemy
player)
forcibly
knocks
him
out
of
any
dash
animation.
This
means
that,
if
timed
correctly,
it
can
block
enemy
champions
trying
to
escape
(like
Tristana's
Rocket
Jump
,
Jax's
Leap
Strike
,
Vi's
Vault
Breaker
,
etc.)
or
enemy
initiations,
even
unstoppable
ultimates
(like
Malphite's
Unstopable
force
,
Vi's
Assault
and
Battery
of
Nocturne's
Paranoia
).
It
can
even
save
allies,
by
blocking
their
path,
as
they
are
displaced
by
enemy
abilities
(Like
Gragas'
Explosive
Cask
or
Blitzcrank's
Rocket
Grab
).
Anivia's
Crystallize
and
Jarvan
IV's
Cataclysm
can
provide
the
same
effect,
albeit
much
harder,
due
to
the
terrain's
smaller
area
of
displacement,
or
manner
in
which
it
is
applied.
Because
enemies
usually
haven't
built
much
armor
or
magic
resistance
early
in
the
game,
Trundle's
Subjugate
does
not
offer
him
much
survivability.
Its
main
use
early
is
for
the
magic
damage
,
the
additional
health
,
and
for
lowering
the
enemy's
resistances
to
make
Trundle
hurt
a
little
more
(and
Trundle
's
teammates
if
they
attack
the
correct
enemy).
Use
Subjugate
to
soften
a
powerful
enemy
tank
for
your
own
survivability
or
to
create
a
target
for
your
team
to
focus
fire.
Sometimes,
it
may
be
better
to
Subjugate
a
squishy
target
as
once
they
die,
Trundle
will
be
healed
by
King's
Tribute
.
When
a
early
team
fight
breaks
out,
use
Subjugate
on
the
squishiest
targets,
like
whomever
is
doing
more
damage
between
the
ranged
attack
damage
carry
or
ability
power
carry.
Trundle's
Subjugate
enables
him
to
effectively
become
a
tanky
DPS
even
without
building
many
tank
items.
This
combined
with
inherent
CC
reduction
makes
for
a
DPS
champion
that
is
difficult
to
disable.
Build
usage
Although
Trundle
has
an
exceptional
early
game,
he
does
not
scale
well.
Beginning
around
mid
and
into
late
game,
Trundle
becomes
very
item
dependent
to
increase
his
survivability
and
damage.
Building
good
and
cost
effective
items
are
important
for
him.
Damage
An
early
Wriggle's
Lantern
helps
Trundle
in
the
jungle,
the
armor
strengthens
his
anti-AD
role
with
Chomp
as
well
as
alleviating
his
armor
scaling
problem.
Blade
of
the
Ruined
King
is
preferred
over
The
Bloodthirster
;
Trundle
becomes
an
effective
anti-tank
in
conjunction
with
Subjugate
and
a
BT
is
not
very
consistent
as
its
item
efficiency
depends
on
maintaining
stacks.
Its
active
is
exceedingly
good
at
scaring
the
daylights
out
of
ADCs.
The
5%
bonus
damage
also
helps
with
tanks,
improves
his
already
exceptional
attack
speed
while
on
his
W,
and
gives
him
lifesteal
to
burn.
Ironically,
Blade
of
the
Ruined
King
is
sort
of
a
'Trundlizer'
for
other
champions:
there's
a
slow
component
(Trundle's
E),
a
damage
bonus
for
autoattacks
(his
Q),
health
regen,
although
via
lifesteal
(Trundle's
passive)
and
an
attack
speed
bonus
(Trundle's
W).
Youmuu's
Ghostblade
is
good
for
Trundle
as
it
gives
a
lot
of
stats
that
will
help
him
perform
well.
Cooldown
reduction
is
good
because
Trundle
is
only
as
good
as
his
buffs
and
debuffs
last
and
helps
him
keep
them
up.
Attack
damage
,
critical
strike
,
and
armor
penetration
help
him
do
more
physical
damage
and
furthermore,
armor
penetration
helps
even
more
combined
with
Subjugate
.
The
active
will
increase
his
attack
speed
and
damage
per
second.
Trinity
Force
is
a
very
viable
buy
to
Trundle
as
it
enhances
every
aspect
of
gameplay
that
makes
Trundle
good.
A
Zeal
gives
him
a
movement
speed
buff
in
addition
to
his
Frozen
Domain
.
The
Phage
gives
him
a
movement
speed
steroid
that
synergizes
with
his
Frozen
Domain
.
Chomp
works
especially
well
with
Sheen
and
Trinity
Force
as
it
will
both
activate
and
consume
the
proc
to
deal
increased
damage.
This
can
allow
Trundle
to
last
hit
minions
more
effectively
and
take
down
targets
easily.
Iceborn
Gauntlet
should
probably
be
considered
the
first
item
for
laning
Trundle,
or
second
(after
Spirit
of
the
Ancient
Golem
).
IBG
gives
an
improved
version
of
Sheen
procs,
cooldown
reduction,
armor,
basically
a
permaslow
while
using
Trundle's
Q,
more
mana
for
abilities
and
AOE
damage.
Cooldown
Reduction
Frozen
Heart
is
a
great
cooldown
reduction
item
that
helps
Trundle's
armor
scaling
problem
when
you
are
fighting
an
enemy
team
generally
AD.
Consider
purchasing
a
Zeke's
Herald
as
a
tanky
DPS.
Although
it's
mainly
an
item
for
cooldown
reduction
on
Trundle
,
the
other
stats
are
also
useful,
health
for
survivability
and
a
helpful
life
steal
and
attack
damage
aura
.
Spirit
Visage
works
very
well
in
conjunction
with
Frozen
Domain
,
because
they
increase
your
self-healing
of
King's
Tribute
and
Subjugate
aditionaly
giving
cooldown
reduction
,
health
and
magic
resist
when
you
are
fighting
an
enemy
team
generally
AP.
However,
this
is
still
a
good
option
regardless
of
the
enemy
team.
When
playing
Trundle
as
a
support,
Talisman
of
Ascension
doesn't
offer
a
lot
of
stats
that
Trundle
desires,
However,
it
is
still
a
good
choice
because
an
early
Ancient
coin
can
help
with
Trundle's
early
mana
issues
while
the
health
regeneration
stacks
with
his
King's
Tribute
's
healing
for
great
sustain.
The
final
upgrade
to
Ancient
Coin
,
Talisman
of
Ascension
,
provides
Trundle
with
six
effects,
including
a
version
of
the
former
Shurelia's
item:
the
temporary
aura
speedup.
Health
Purchasing
an
early
Aegis
of
the
Legion
provides
some
durability
and
resistances
and
helps
the
team.
It
can
be
later
upgraded
into
a
Locket
of
the
Iron
Solari
.
A
Frozen
Mallet
is
a
good
option
for
health
.
A
Frozen
Mallet
is
useful
for
Trundle
as
it
keeps
the
enemy
on
the
AoE
of
Frozen
Domain
.
Randuin's
Omen
can
serve
as
Trundle
's
primary
armor
item
.
The
movement
speed
slow
keeps
anyone
that
chooses
to
fight
Trundle
on
his
Frozen
Domain
area
of
effect
and
helps
Trundle
avoid
being
kited,
the
attack
speed
slow
and
Chomp
helps
them
do
less
damage,
and
the
active,
especially
when
paired
with
Subjugate
for
a
longer
duration,
can
be
devastating
for
enemies
in
a
team
fight.
Jungling
It
should
be
noted
however
that
Trundle
is
very
much
reliant
on
specific
jungling
masteries
and
runes
in
order
to
support
that
style
of
play.
Jungle
should
only
be
taken
if
conditions
are
favorable.

Trundle
's
strengths
in
the
jungle
are
his
sustain
with
King's
Tribute
and
his
ability
to
invade
the
enemy
jungle
as
he
can
duel
most
AD
champions
favorably
with
his
Chomp
and
he
easily
escape
with
Frozen
Domain
and
Pillar
of
Ice
.
Trundle
is
pretty
mana
dependent
and
will
need
either
Crest
of
the
Ancient
Golem
or
Mana
Potion
s
for
a
second
jungle
clear.
Trundle
can
gank
at
level
2
(really
just
showing
his
face
to
make
them
waste
Flash
)
but
he
needs
all
of
his
abilities
(
Frozen
Domain
and
Pillar
of
Ice
are
critical
so
level
3
at
the
earliest)
in
order
to
gank
effectively
so
he
is
pretty
much
stuck
in
his
jungle
route,
no
shortcuts
should
be
taken.
Trundle
is
able
to
solo
Dragon
as
early
as
level
6
with
a
Vampiric
Scepter
and
a
few
Health
Potion
s.
Care
must
be
taken,
as
Frozen
Domain
is
favorable
to
help
kill
Dragon
but
may
also
alert
enemies
to
your
presence.
Some
mana
regeneration
like
Mana
Potion
s
or
Crest
of
the
Ancient
Golem
and
damage
over
time
from
Blessing
of
the
Lizard
Elder
is
also
advisable.

Countering
Avoid
battling
Trundle
near
minions.
If
a
minion
is
killed,
Trundle
will
regain
health
due
to
his
King's
Tribute
.
This
can
sometimes
turn
a
battle
to
his
favor.
Be
aware
that
he
has
exceptional
health
regeneration
along
with
his
King's
Tribute
to
easily
sustain
himself
and
recover
from
most
harass
in
a
laning
situation.
Trundle
excels
at
fighting
inside
his
Frozen
Domain
AoE.
Moving
away
from
the
spell's
AoE
can
help
you
1v1
him.
Pillar
of
Ice
can
block
your
way
of
escape
and
slow
your
movement
speed
.
Therefore,
it
is
best
to
avoid
the
spell's
AoE
or
use
Flash
to
quickly
go
over
it.
Top
laners
with
ranged
capacity
(such
as
Jayce
or
Kayle
)
will
have
good
effect
against
Trundle
if
he
attempts
to
push
or
attack.
Avoid
a
head-on
fight
with
Trundle
early-game
in
most
cases.
His
early-game
damage
is
high,
and
his
Chomp
can
reduce
your
own
ability
to
retaliate.
Try
to
focus
on
ranged
harass
and
wearing
him
down
as
Trundle
has
fewer
options
to
retaliate
than
he
would
against
melee
attackers.
If
Trundle
uses
his
Subjugate
on
you,
it
is
best
to
avoid
him
and
wait
until
the
debuff
is
over
because
Subjugate
can
melt
even
the
toughest
tank,
or
allow
Trundle
to
dive
into
your
team
and
survive
strictly
attacking
your
squishy
damage-dealers
with
the
rest
of
his
team
helping
him
even
with
your
best
attempts
to
focus
him
down.
As
it
is
a
large
part
of
Trundle's
durability
which
is
necessary
for
him
functioning
in
teamfights,
using
escapes
to
avoid
letting
him
take
advantage
of
Subjugate's
bonuses
can
leave
him
much
more
vulnerable
while
it
is
cooling
down.
Trundle
is
always
at
least
a
decent
duelist.
Treat
him
the
same
way
you
would
a
Jax
,
Tryndamere
,
a
fed
Sion
,
etc.
It
is
heavily
recommend
to
avoid
1v1s
with
him
at
any
time
past
level
3.
During
mid
and
late
game,
it
is
usually
recommended
to
bring
overwhelming
damage
(think
having
2
more
people
on
your
side
for
any
fights,
so
3v1,
4v2,
5v3)
or
ridiculous
amounts
of
CC
(think
Sejuani
AND
Leona
).
