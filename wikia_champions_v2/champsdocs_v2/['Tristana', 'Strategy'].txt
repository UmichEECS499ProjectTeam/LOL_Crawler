Skill
usage
Draw
a
Bead
becomes
extremely
powerful
later
in
the
game,
allowing
Tristana
to
hit
enemies
from
afar.
Tristana
can
outrange
any
other
ranged
carry
at
level
13,
making
her
a
very
strong
pick
if
your
team
lacks
hard
CC
and
already
has
a
wide
array
of
slows.
Kog'Maw's
Bio-Arcane
Barrage
out-ranges
Draw
a
Bead
by
7
range
at
level
18.
Leveling
Rapid
Fire
early
on
is
unadvisable,
since
Tristana's
low
base
Attack
Damage
early
on
the
game
doesn't
make
much
use
of
the
AS
steroid.
Wait
until
you
buy
some
AD
items
such
as
B.
F.
Sword
.
Rapid
Fire
is
applied
to
the
next
autoattack's
wait
period
-
cast
it
right
before
an
autoattack
to
squeeze
as
much
as
you
can
from
the
duration.
Since
that
Rocket
Jump
resets
on
kills
or
assists
you
may
use
it
to
secure
a
kill,
and
allows
Tristana
to
either
Rocket
Jump
out
of
a
deadly
situation
after
she
has
gotten
a
kill
or
jump
again
to
set
up
another.
The
cost
of
Rocket
Jump
is
high
compared
to
her
mana
pool.
Pay
attention
that
you
have
enough
mana
before
jumping
in.
Tristana
can
use
abilities
while
in
the
air
from
Rocket
Jump
.
This
allows
a
very
strong,
fast
combo
if
you
play
her
as
an
AP
caster.
Using
Rocket
Jump
to
leap
over
an
enemy
and
then
using
Buster
Shot
to
send
them
flying
back
to
your
allies
or
an
allied
turret
can
be
very
effective,
but
be
careful
about
using
the
strategy
in
large
team
fights.
Rocket
Jump
can
also
be
used
defensively,
especially
for
jumping
out
of
AoE
abilities
such
as
Event
Horizon
or
Absolute
Zero
,
as
well
as
in
and
out
of
the
base
walls
around
the
Nexus
on
Summoner's
Rift
and
Twisted
Treeline
.
Be
careful
when
using
Rocket
Jump
as
it
is
considered
a
"dash",
even
though
it
is
visually
a
"jump".
This
means
that
if
you
jump
over
a
trap
(like
Yordle
Snap
Trap
)
you
will
activate
the
trap
and
its
effects.
Use
Explosive
Shot
on
enemy
champions
who
rely
on
regeneration
or
healing.
This
severely
drops
their
chances
of
survival,
as
it
reduces
their
regeneration/healing
by
half.
The
passive
of
Explosive
Shot
is
surprisingly
useful
in
farming
-
if
there
are
a
lot
of
minions
in
a
relatively
confined
area,
killing
one
could
burst
the
remaining
minions
and
gain
a
lot
of
gold
in
a
relatively
short
time,
without
the
use
of
abilities.
Combine
this
with
Rapid
Fire
and
she
can
easily
farm
up
and
clear
minion
waves
with
an
ease.
Be
careful
though,
this
will
push
the
lane
hard
which
leaves
her
open
to
ganks.
In
the
early
game,
Explosive
Shot
is
your
best
method
of
harassing
enemies,
as
your
autoattacks
are
weak
early
on
and
Rocket
Jump
leaves
you
vulnerable
at
melee
range.
Explosive
Shot
Resets
your
auto
attack
animation,
so
you
can
add
an
attack
before
and
after
shooting
Explosive
Shot
for
extra
damage.
Using
a
Buster
Shot
to
move
a
disruptive
caster
such
as
Ryze
or
Veigar
away
can
give
you
a
strong
advantage
in
team
fights
or
ganks.
Buster
Shot
will
also
interrupt
channeled
abilities
such
as
Karthus's
Requiem
,
Katarina's
Death
Lotus
,
or
Nunu's
Absolute
Zero
.
Buster
Shot
can
be
used
to
push
various
groups
of
close
enemies
tightly
packed
together.
Use
this
to
help
distance
enemies
from
yourself
when
fleeing.
It
can
even
knock
them
through
small
walls.
Tristana
is
best
placed
in
the
back
of
a
group
or
flanking
enemies
from
the
side.
Using
Rocket
Jump
to
escape
and
using
Buster
Shot
while
in
mid-air
can
make
sure
that
you
escape.
Using
Buster
Shot
On
any
character
trying
to
get
near
you,
allows
you
to
attack
them
from
longer
range
with
your
passive,
giving
you
sometimes
an
easy
kill
on
a
melee
DPS
champion.
If
timed
correctly,
Buster
Shot
can
be
used
to
counter
a
champion
that
is
dashing
to
Tristana
.
Build
usage
Tristana's
low
base
movement
makes
it
difficult
for
her
to
chase
enemies
or
to
escape.
This
is
especially
prominent
at
low
levels.
Getting
Boots
of
Speed
quickly
is
highly
beneficial.
Be
sure
to
watch
the
enemy
builds
and
pick
the
proper
boot
upgrade.
While
Phage
may
seem
to
be
a
good
item
to
buy
due
to
the
on-hit
effect
that
grants
movement
speed
to
Tristana
;
the
main
item
that
it
builds
into,
Trinity
Force
,
is
not
a
cost
effective
item
since
most
of
Tristana
's
damage
comes
from
basic
attacks
and
lacks
any
low
cooldown
abilities
to
constantly
proc
the
Sheen
's
passive.
In
addition,
the
stats
that
Trinity
Force
grants
to
Tristana
is
very
mediocre
at
best.
Because
of
this,
if
Tristana
needs
movement
speed,
it's
better
to
build
flat
attack
speed
items
that
grants
movement
speed
such
as
Phantom
Dancer
,
Statikk
Shiv
,
and
Zephyr
instead.
Be
careful
when
picking
Tristana
,
as
an
enemy's
blind
can
render
you
fairly
useless.
A
Quicksilver
Sash
can
be
used
to
counter
blinding
champions
such
as
Teemo
and
to
escape
other
hard
CC's.
Quicksilver
Sash
can
later
be
upgraded
into
Mercurial
Scimitar
,
which
provides
more
attack
damage
for
Tristana
.
Consider
building
Blade
of
the
Ruined
King
if
you
are
dealing
with
tanks
building
a
lot
of
high
health
items
or
benefits
from
building
high
health
items
like
Shen
and
Dr.
Mundo
.
Blade
of
the
Ruined
King
also
mitigates
some
of
her
weak-mid
game
thanks
to
the
passive
that
procs
with
her
auto-attacks
and
the
active
adding
additional
self-peeling
power
with
her
Buster
Shot
and
Rocket
Jump
.
Tristana's
high
attack
speed
steroid
and
powerful
attack
range
make
Infinity
Edge
especially
cost
efficient
on
her.
AP
Tristana
Due
to
her
high
AP
ratios
on
her
abilites,
Tristana
can
also
be
built
AP
if
your
team
requires
an
AP
nuker
as
well
as
an
AP
support
due
to
being
ranged
with
decent
crowd
control
capabilities.
Similar
to
the
original
AP
Master
Yi
,
Tristana
loses
her
DPS
potential
with
a
full-AP
build,
but
gains
newfound
burst
damage
to
whittle
down
targets
and
in
teamfights,
she
can
potentially
one-shot
them.
However,
this
type
of
build
offers
very
risky
gameplay,
as
Tristana
must
make
sure
to
play
safe
due
to
lack
of
strong-auto
attacks,
as
well
as
her
general
squishiness.
Deathfire
Grasp
greatly
improves
Tristana's
single-target
burst.
Lich
Bane
is
also
great
item
for
her
AP
build,
as
you
can
get
in
extra
proc
from
your
Rapid
Fire
.
Morellonomicon
is
another
great
early
game
item
for
Tristana
as
it
offers
Grievous
Wounds
to
all
of
her
AP
ratio
abilities
and
not
just
for
her
Explosive
Shot
,
and
the
cooldown
reduction
and
mana
regeneration
also
helps.
Rushing
Rabadon's
Deathcap
and/or
Wooglet's
Witchcap
can
cause
Tristana
to
dominate
early
game
if
possible,
due
to
her
high
AP
ratios.
Like
with
Lich
Bane
,
Nashor's
Tooth
in
combo
with
it
can
not
only
provide
cooldown
reduction
and
attack
speed
for
Tristana
to
retain
DPS,
but
due
to
the
procs
scaling
off
her
AP,
it
can
make
up
for
her
lost
ADC
style.

Countering
Tristana
is
an
AD-carry
with
massive
base
damage
on
3
of
her
spells
giving
her
a
very
powerful
early
game.
However
when
built
AD
she
does
not
have
scaling
for
her
burst
abilities
due
to
the
lack
of
ability
power,
meaning
her
mid-game
is
a
little
weak.
Abuse
this,
since
Tristana
late
game
is
one
of
the
closest
to
unstoppable
in
the
entire
league
due
to
massive
range,
AS-boost
and
the
peeling
power
of
Rocket
Jump
and
her
ultimate.
DO
NOT
underestimate
her
though,
as
even
with
a
"weak"
mid-game,
she
can
and
does
have
decent
burst
when
done
right,
and
any
decent
Tristana
player
will
be
working
to
compensate
for
this.
Tristana
has
a
huge
range
when
she
reaches
level
18
because
of
her
Draw
a
Bead
;
avoid
getting
kited.
Early
game,
her
range
is
fairly
short;
use
it
to
your
advantage
to
harass
her
and
deny
her
farm.
Tristana
has
a
lot
of
burst
damage
from
her
abilities
early
on
-
buying
early
defenses
along
with
having
a
way
to
escape
her/peel
her
from
you
can
hinder
her
from
zoning
or
killing
you
at
the
early
game.
A
target
surviving
her
abilities
being
cast
on
them
leaves
her
vulnerable
to
counter-attacks
if
they
have
the
health
or
sustain
to
stick
around.
Standing
near
the
brush
can
allow
you
to
duck
into
it
after
she
uses
Rocket
Jump
on
you,
avoiding
a
good
follow-up
from
the
rest
of
her
abilities.
As
Rocket
Jump
is
the
lynch-pin
to
her
combo,
she
can
then
be
attacked
from
range
after
escaping
her
without
fear
of
reprisal
while
it
is
on
cooldown.
Tristana
has
no
long-range
poke
abilities
-
having
a
champion
that
can
do
this
can
damage
her
freely.
As
the
range
of
Rocket
Jump
is
very
long,
however,
being
a
champion
that
can
escape
or
having
a
partner
that
can
peel
that
is
likely
also
a
requirement.
Tristana
is
vulnerable
to
being
hit
by
skillshots
during
the
animation
of
Rocket
Jump
(being
essentially
a
very
slow
dash)
and
hard
crowd
control
can
stop
the
ability
entirely
while
it
is
casting,
returning
her
to
where
she
started.
Move
away
from
a
low
health
minion
at
early
game
to
avoid
the
damage
from
her
Explosive
Shot
.
Tristana
mainly
deals
damage
from
her
auto-attacks.
Randuin's
Omen
and
Frozen
Heart
are
good
options
to
counter
build
aginst
her,
since
it
will
greatly
reduce
her
damage
per
second
output.
A
Thornmail
will
counter
her
damage,
but
generally
is
a
less
better
option
since
it
helps
to
defend
only
yourself.
Try
to
not
engage
her
when
she
can
easily
escape
with
her
Rocket
Jump
and
Buster
Shot
off
cooldown.
The
exeption
is
when
you
can
hold
her
in
place
with
Crowd
Control
long
enough
to
kill
her.
If
Tristana
is
building
AP
,
be
very
cautious
and
ward
well
as
she
may
jump
out
of
nowhere
and
one-shot
you
easily.
Also,
missing
calls
can
prevent
a
lot
of
her
potential
ganks.
In
team
fights,
do
not
leave
any
squishy
teamates
in
the
front
and
prepare
some
CC
for
her
all-in.
Be
sure
to
back
away
if
your
team
have
multiple
low
health
allies.
She
may
get
multiple
kills
because
the
cooldown
of
Rocket
Jump
resets
whenether
she
gets
a
kill
or
assist
.
