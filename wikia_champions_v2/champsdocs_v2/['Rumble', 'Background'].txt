Trivia
Lore
Even
amongst
yordles
,
Rumble
was
always
the
runt
of
the
litter.
As
such,
he
was
used
to
being
bullied.
In
order
to
survive,
he
had
to
be
scrappier
and
more
resourceful
than
his
peers.
He
developed
a
quick
temper
and
a
reputation
for
getting
even,
no
matter
who
crossed
him.
This
made
him
something
of
a
loner,
but
he
didn't
mind.
He
liked
to
tinker,
preferring
the
company
of
gadgets,
and
he
could
usually
be
found
rummaging
through
the
junkyard.
He
showed
great
potential
as
a
mechanic.
His
teachers
recommended
him
for
enrollment
at
the
Yordle
Academy
of
Science
and
Progress
in
Piltover
,
where
he
may
very
well
have
become
one
of
Heimerdinger's
esteemed
protégés,
but
Rumble
refused
to
go.
He
believed
that
Heimerdinger
and
his
associates
were
"sellouts",
trading
superior
yordle
technology
to
humans
for
nothing
more
than
a
pat
on
the
head
while
yordles
remained
the
butt
of
their
jokes.
When
a
group
of
human
graduates
from
the
Yordle
Academy
sailed
to
Bandle
City
to
visit
the
place
where
their
mentor
was
born
and
raised,
Rumble
couldn't
resist
the
temptation
to
see
them
face-to-face
(so
to
speak).
He
only
intended
to
get
a
good
look
at
the
humans,
but
four
hours
and
several
choice
words
later,
he
returned
home
bruised
and
bloodied
with
an
earful
about
how
he
was
an
embarrassment
to
"enlightened"
yordles
like
Heimerdinger.
The
next
morning
he
left
Bandle
City
without
a
word,
and
wasn't
seen
again
for
months.
When
he
returned,
he
was
at
the
helm
of
a
clanking,
mechanized
monstrosity.
He
marched
it
to
the
center
of
town
amidst
dumbfounded
onlookers
and
there
announced
that
he
would
join
the
League
of
Legends
to
show
the
world
what
yordle-tech
was
really
capable
of,
without
hiding
behind
a
foreign
banner.
"Ugh,
it's
gonna
take
forever
to
scrape
your
face
off
my
suit!"

CLE
OBSERVATION
Rumble
clanks
into
the
Great
Hall
with
the
least
grace
shown
by
any
candidate
since
Gragas.
He
battles
with
the
controls
of
his
scraped-together
battle-suit,
peculiarly
named
"Tristy".
The
suit
lumbers
forward,
a
marvel
of
unrefined
construction.
Rumble's
movements
are
jerky,
quick;
he
seems
to
enjoy
the
frantic
micromanagement.
The
great
ball
of
spikes
that
is
Tristy's
left
hand
rears
back
in
front
of
the
doors.
As
though
self-aware,
they
fling
open
abruptly
and
the
Reflecting
Chamber's
impenetrable
darkness
unfurls
into
the
Great
Hall.
Rumble
snorts
with
derision
before
urging
the
machine
forward.
REFLECTION
Humans
did
love
playing
their
games.
Rumble
doubted
that
important
humans
like
Prince
Jarvan
were
dumped
in
a
dark
broom
closet
while
some
League
goon
got
all
fancied
up
for
a
beat
down.
"Oh
well,
if
the
longlegs
want
to
see
what
kind
of
champion
I'll
be,
I'm
happy
to
show
‘em."
He
was
bubbling
with
anticipation.
"Itchy
fist
syndrome"
someone
once
called
it,
except
now
his
"fists"
consisted
of
a
pressurized,
two-cylinder
flame
projection
system
and
a
pneumatic
piston-mace
assembly
Rumble
often
referred
to
as
"the
short
hello".
He
was
only
worried
for
the
guy
they'd
sent
to
test
him.
"No
need
to
worry,"
growled
a
gravelly,
robotic
voice
behind
him,
"I
will
take
it
easy
on
you!"
Rumble
hammered
the
control
yoke,
spinning
Tristy's
cockpit
180
degrees
with
nauseating
speed.
He
half-pulled
the
trigger
to
launch
his
electro-harpoon
before
he
realized
he
was
staring
at
a
wall.
"Over
here
now!"
The
voice
was
behind
him
again,
amused.
Rumble
punched
one
of
the
pedals
when
he
spun
back,
whirling
to
face
the
owner
of
the
voice.
The
instant
the
cockpit
came
to
a
stop,
the
harpoon
misfired,
hurtling
straight
for
the
poor
League
crony.
Normally
Rumble
preferred
to
look
someone
in
the
eye
before
he
impaled
them
on
an
electrified
javelin,
but
he
certainly
wasn't
one
to
stand
on
ceremony.
As
his
eyes
came
to
rest
on
the
target,
his
enthusiasm
evaporated.
The
harpoon
plinked
harmlessly
off
the
shiny,
finished
exterior
of
a
titanic
battle-suit.
It
stood
easily
four
times
the
height
of
Rumble's,
supported
by
three
multi-jointed
legs
thick
enough
to
withstand
mortar
fire.
Above
them,
the
chest
–
an
almond-shaped
slab
inset
with
purple
gems
–
was
visibly
generating
some
sort
of
arcano-magnetic
deflection
field.
The
glowing
plate
was
flanked
by
confoundingly
intricate
arm
appendages
which
both
suspended
tactical,
sixteen-cell
missile
arrays.
Rumble
knew
by
the
heads
of
the
missiles
that
each
was
outfitted
with
sorcerous
motion
tracking
and
remote
guidance
systems.
The
arms
terminated
in
two
ten-barrel
rotary
cannons
nestled
in
exterior
composite
plating.
The
leering
head
of
the
behemoth
was
a
fat
bulb
of
tinted
glass
coated
in
sensory
detection
equipment,
presumably
housing
the
pilot.
Where
its
mouth
would
have
been,
a
gleaming
cylinder
protruded,
clearly
the
business
end
of
a
focused-energy
charging
plasma
emitter.
In
other
words:
a
death
ray.
Worst
of
all,
the
armor
of
the
colossus
was
anodized
and
decorated
in
flawless
detail
with
blue
flames,
the
exact
pattern
Rumble
wanted
to
paint
on
his
suit.
Someone
ripped
off
his
dream
design.
Rumble's
fury
overtook
his
awe.
With
a
howl,
he
pulled
every
trigger,
punched
every
button,
and
kicked
every
pedal
that
would
fire
something
at
the
hulking
monstrosity.
In
response,
his
trusty
suit
Tristy
sputtered
and
fell
over.
Rumble
tumbled
from
his
seat,
cursing.
One
of
these
days,
he
would
install
seat
belts…right
after
he
finished
the
designs
for
the
Juicer.
He
rolled
to
his
feet
and
gave
Tristy
a
firm
kick
in
the
mace
–
the
usual
fix.
Tristy
shuddered
back
to
life,
but
she
became
suddenly
obscured
by
a
looming
shadow.
Rumble
blinked.
When
he
opened
his
eyes,
his
vision
was
filled
by
one
of
the
giant's
tree
trunk
legs.
It
twisted
slightly,
and
the
wail
of
grinding
alloys
confirmed
Rumble's
worst
fear.
Tristy
had
been
stomped
flat.
There
have
been
times
in
Rumble's
life
when
he's
had
lapses
of
memory.
They
usually
occurred
when
he
was
being
bullied
or
beaten
badly
enough
that
he
didn't
think
he'd
pull
through.
Things
just
went
dark.
Usually
when
he'd
come
out
of
it,
there
would
be
a
bunch
of
yordles
either
on
the
ground
bloodied
or
looking
at
him
like
he
had
a
wrench
sticking
out
of
his
head
(which
was
only
actually
the
case
once).
In
this
instance,
he
was
clawing
madly
at
the
foot
of
the
steel
mammoth,
throat
hoarse
and
fur
in
disarray.
The
foot
remained
in
good
condition.
With
a
popping
hiss,
the
head
of
the
beast
split
open,
revealing
an
unmistakable
bushy
blonde
afro.
"Heimerdinger!"
Rumble
bellowed,
"You're
gonna
pay
for
this!
Deserter!
Traitor!
Get
down
here!"
His
voice
cracked
more
times
than
he'd
have
liked.
"That
would
be
a
poor
strategy
indeed!"
Heimerdinger
exclaimed,
after
brief
consideration.
"You
can
return
to
Bandle
City.
I'm
sorry
it
didn't
work
out!"
"Return?!"
Rumble
laughed.
"You
think
I'm
done
with
you?
This
fight
just
got
started!
You
already-"
He
was
airborne
before
he
could
finish
his
sentence.
It
looked
like
something
shot
out
from
the
death
machine
and
exploded
in
front
of
him,
but
his
vision
was
so
blurry
he
couldn't
confirm
it.
He
soared
almost
casually
through
the
air
until
the
wall
stopped
him.
"The
probability
of
your
continued
existence
is
rapidly
approaching
zero."
Heimerdinger
remarked
absent-mindedly.
Rumble
opened
his
eyes
and
coaxed
his
lungs
to
breathe.
He
was
lying
on
his
side
facing
Heimerdinger.
Neither
the
wall
nor
the
floor
did
a
good
job
cushioning
his
fall.
He
wasn't
going
to
be
able
to
take
many
more
shots
like
these.
"You
missed."
He
choked,
managing
a
smirk.
He
wobbled
to
his
feet,
bracing
himself
against
the
wall.
"Why
do
you
want
to
join
the
League,
Rumble?"
He
thought
Heimerdinger's
voice
sounded
strange,
but
it
was
difficult
to
tell
through
the
ringing
in
his
ears.
"Oh
now
you
want
to
chit-chat."
"Your
machine
is
destroyed.
You
will
be
unable
to
compete
without-"
"Why's
that?
I'm
too
small?
Too
weak?
Tell
me
a
new
one.
I'm
the
one
they
invited
here,
not
my
machine,
and
I'm
not
leaving
that
easy.
Bandle
City
needs
more
loyal
champions,
and
I'm
not
gonna
back
down
from
some
big-haired
Piltover
lapdog."
Broken
and
battered,
Rumble's
voice
didn't
lose
any
attitude.
He
brought
his
fists
up,
the
motion
was
excruciating.
"How
does
it
feel
exposing
your
mind?"
"How
does
it-?
What
kind
of
question
is
that?
Let's
finish
this!
You're
gonna
pay
for
what
you
did
to
Trist-"
Heimerdinger
was
gone.
Rumble
was
sitting
in
the
cockpit,
looking
at
Tristy's
instrument
panel.
The
pain
was
gone.
He
was
back
in
the
broom
closet,
but
someone
apparently
turned
the
lights
on.
He
couldn't
suppress
the
smile
that
crept
across
his
face.
He
hugged
the
dashboard.
"I
thought
I
lost
you
for
a
second
there,
girl.
But
don't
worry,
I
would've
fixed
you.
Now
we
gotta
go
pay
someone
back
for
this
whole
mess."
He
took
hold
of
the
yolks
and
kicked
the
pedals.
Tristy
sprung
to
action,
leaping
forward.
Then
she
sputtered
and
fell
over.

Harpoon?
Check.
Flamethrower?

Triple

Check,
check,
and

Just
to
be
safe,
we'll
throw
in
one
mischievous
yordle
whose
mechanical
prowess
has
been
used
to
make
the
most
diabolical
machination
ever
to
hit
the
Fields
of
Justice.
Meet
Rumble,
the
Mechanized
Menace.
His
desire
to
see
you
burned,
speared,
crushed,
stomped,
blown
up,
or
otherwise
grievously
injured,
has
him
pushing
his
war
machine
way
beyond
what
would
be
considered
safe
operating
procedure,
even
if
he
might
blow
a
gasket.
But
don't
call
him
short.
That'll
really
grind
his
gears.
