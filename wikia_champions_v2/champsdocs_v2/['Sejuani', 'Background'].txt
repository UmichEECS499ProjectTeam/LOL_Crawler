Sejuani
was
weaned
on
hardship
and
reared
on
barbarity.
Where
others
succumbed
to
the
harshness
of
the
Freljord
,
she
was
tempered
by
it
until
pain
became
power,
hunger
an
encouragement,
and
frost
an
ally
in
culling
the
weak.
Through
her
ordeals,
she
learned
that
to
thrive
in
the
endless
winter,
one
must
become
just
as
cold
and
unforgiving.
In
Sejuani's
eyes,
her
followers
either
have
the
mettle
to
endure
or
the
right
to
die.
Once
she
has
conquered
the
Freljord,
she
knows
that
those
who
survive
will
form
a
nation
to
be
feared.
As
a
child,
the
leader
of
the
Winter's
Claw
watched
her
tribe's
numbers
slowly
dwindle.
Cold
and
starvation
took
all
but
the
most
resilient.
She
was
the
only
one
of
her
siblings
to
survive
to
her
tenth
year,
leaving
Sejuani
sure
that
she
too
would
die
in
misery.
In
desperation,
she
sought
spiritual
counsel
from
her
tribe's
mystic.
But
the
seer
did
not
foretell
Sejuani's
death.
Instead,
she
prophesized
that
Sejuani
would
one
day
conquer
and
unite
the
divided
tribes
of
the
Freljord.
Armored
with
absolute
faith
in
her
destiny,
Sejuani
pushed
herself
to
extremes
that
would
have
killed
anyone
without
her
will
to
endure.
She
walked
into
blizzards
without
food
or
furs
and
trained
while
frigid
winds
raked
her
flesh.
She
clashed
with
the
strongest
warriors
of
her
tribe,
one
after
another,
until
her
legs
gave
out
beneath
her.
When
she
assumed
leadership
of
her
tribe,
Sejuani
commanded
her
warriors
to
follow
her
example.
Under
her
rule,
the
tribe
grew
stronger
than
they
had
ever
been.
In
the
end,
it
was
an
offer
of
peace
-
rather
than
an
act
of
war
-
that
began
Sejuani's
campaign
of
conquest.
On
the
first
day
of
winter,
envoys
from
Ashe's
tribe
approached
Sejuani's
camp
bearing
a
gift
of
Avarosan
grain.
Ashe's
intent
was
clear:
if
Sejuani
united
with
her
tribe,
the
Winter's
Claw
would
never
go
hungry
again.
To
Sejuani,
the
gift
was
an
insult.
In
Ashe's
tribe,
she
saw
men
and
women,
slight
and
soft,
who
preferred
to
farm
instead
of
fight.
Her
contempt
for
them
was
absolute.
Sejuani
gathered
her
people
and
set
the
grain
alight.
She
proclaimed
that
Ashe's
offer
of
charity
would
bring
only
weakness.
Stripping
the
envoys
of
their
supplies,
Sejuani
sent
them
back
with
a
message:
the
Winter's
Claw
would
prove
to
the
Avarosan
that
only
the
strong
deserve
to
survive
in
the
Freljord.
As
the
grain
burned
behind
them,
Sejuani
rode
out
with
her
warband
to
inflict
the
first
of
many
painful
lessons
to
come.
"I
was
cut
from
the
ice,
shaped
in
the
storms,
hardened
in
the
cold."
―
Sejuani
When
Sejuani
was
born,
the
mystics
of
her
tribe
foretold
that
she
would
be
the
one
to
unite
and
lead
the
divided
territories
of
Freljord
.
Her
people
had
suffered
for
centuries,
as
a
losing
war
on
the
frozen
tundra
pushed
them
farther
and
farther
from
Freljord's
limited
food
supplies.
Sejuani
grew
up
surrounded
by
this
misery,
and
it
fueled
her
desire
to
fulfill
her
destiny.
She
pushed
herself
to
extremes,
walking
out
into
blizzards
without
food
or
furs
and
training
while
frigid
winds
raked
her
flesh.
She
sparred
with
the
strongest
warriors
of
her
tribe,
one
after
another,
until
her
legs
would
give
out
beneath
her.
She
sustained
injuries
that
would
have
killed
any
other
member
of
the
tribe,
but
she
would
only
rise
again,
driven
by
sheer
force
of
will
and
what
her
tribe
took
to
calling
her
"heart
of
the
blizzard."
On
her
twentieth
birthday,
Sejuani
declared
that
she
would
lead
her
people
out
of
their
remote
isolation
to
conquer
the
lands
of
their
enemies.
She
had
completed
her
training
and
she
was
ready
to
face
the
leaders
of
the
opposing
tribes.
Her
feats
had
already
become
legend
and
soldiers
in
her
company
were
inspired
to
new
heights
of
strength
and
resolve.
However,
before
she
struck
out
on
her
campaign,
Ashe
began
campaigning
for
peace
in
Freljord,
joining
the
League
of
Legends
to
demonstrate
how
the
people
could
be
spared
violence.
To
Sejuani,
this
was
a
violation
of
tradition
–
a
coward's
ruse
to
hoard
Freljord's
precious
few
resources.
She
saw
the
confidence
of
her
people
wane
as
it
seemed
they
would
never
be
delivered
from
their
plight.
She
decided
that
to
truly
prove
herself
as
the
rightful
ruler
of
Freljord,
she
must
defeat
Ashe
completely
and
unquestionably
on
the
world's
stage
in
the
League
of
Legends.
"Freljord
provides
for
the
few.
For
the
others,
'peace'
means
only
death."
―
Sejuani
"They
plead
for
mercy
when
they
hear
our
drums,
but
the
wolf
owes
no
consideration
to
the
prey.
We
do
not
sow
seeds
and
till
earth
like
the
Avarosan.
We
do
not
stand
watch
over
shattered
ruins
like
the
Frostguard.
We
do
not
pity
the
meek,
for
courage
is
the
true
salvation
of
the
Freljord!
We
are
the
war
cry
of
the
wind,
we
are
the
strength
of
the
mountains.
We
are
the
claws
of
winter!"

Sejuani
was

by
Volty
.
Champion
Sneak
Peek
Announcement
made
by
NeeksNaman
As
some
of
our
more
discerning
lore-hounds
may
have
anticipated,
Sejauni,
the
Winter's
Wrath,
is
charging
in
as
our
next
upcoming
champion.
We
wanted
to
take
a
moment
to
talk
to
you
about
her
gameplay,
and
what
you
can
expect
to
see.
Hailing
from
the
Freljord,
Sejuani
combines
raw,
physical
might
with
the
chilling
ice
of
her
homeland.
After
slowing
enemies
with
her
Frost
passive
on
auto-attacks,
she
can
activate
her
Permafrost
ability
to
drastically
increase
the
slow
and
inflict
damage.
This
allows
her
to
continuously
disrupt
enemy
movements
and
create
a
threatening
presence
–
a
necessity
of
any
primary
tank.
Sejuani's
initiation
ability
comes
from
two
sources:
the
powerful
skillshot
charge
from
her
boar
and
her
Glacial
Prison
ultimate.
The
former
tramples
enemies
and
applies
Frost,
while
the
latter
flings
a
giant
ice
shard
from
her
flail,
stunning
anything
it
hits
by
encasing
it
in
ice.
Enemies
near
that
target
get
stunned
for
a
shorter
durartion.
This
makes
accurate
skillshots
important,
as
Sejuani
needs
move
into
the
right
position
to
maximize
the
stun
duration
on
her
intended
target.
If
used
correctly,
this
ability
can
change
the
outcome
of
a
teamfight.
If
used
on
a
sub-optimal
target,
however,
it
will
be
partially
wasted
on
a
tank
or
lower-value
target.
This
being
our
first
mounted
champion,
we're
happy
to
release
not
only
an
epic
barbarian
woman
on
a
giant
boar,
but
also
a
tank
who
can
use
continuous
soft
disruption
with
bursts
of
big,
ultimate
initiation!
