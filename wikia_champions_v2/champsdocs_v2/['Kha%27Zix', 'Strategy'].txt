Trivia
Skill
usage
Enemies
are
considered
isolated
if
they
have
no
allies
within
a
short
distance.
The
damage
of
Taste
Their
Fear
is
massively
increased
against
these
targets.
This
includes
neutral
monsters
so
it
can
be
worthwhile
to
kill
off
the
lesser
monsters
first
so
the
tougher,
final
monster
will
take
considerable
extra
damage
from
Taste
Their
Fear
.
However,
this
tactic
should
be
used
selectively
as
it
does
not
noticeably
reduce
clear
time,
and
you
may
even
incur
extra
damage
by
letting
the
tougher
monster
live
longer.
Kha'Zix
works
well
with
allies
who
punish
enemies
for
staying
close
together
such
as
Alistar
or
Varus
.
He
also
works
well
with
allies
who
have
abilities
that
can
separate
and
isolate
enemies,
such
as
Gragas
and
Xin
Zhao
.
Unseen
Threat
activates
when
Kha'Zix
cannot
be
seen
by
the
enemy
team,
so
you
can
reactivate
it
by
using
brush
or
Void
Assault
.
This
can
be
used
as
an
effective
form
of
harass
in
lane
or
to
provide
steady
but
heavy
damage
output.
Unseen
Threat
can
also
be
an
effective
way
to
check
for
wards
as
Kha'Zix
will
only
receive
the
buff
when
the
enemy
team
loses
sight
of
him.
Use
the
multiple
periods
of
stealth
granted
by
Void
Assault
to
juke
enemy
skills.
Void
Assault
gives
Kha'Zix
incredibly
high
mobility
.
If
you
have
invested
an
evolution
point
into
Void
Assault
,
you
can
use
the
brief
50%
damage
reduction
to
reduce
the
impact
of
significant
burst
damage
when
timed
correctly.
When
ganking
before
level
6,
try
to
keep
Leap
available
in
case
the
enemy
uses
Flash
or
other
escape
skills.
From
levels
6
and
up,
use
Void
Assault
as
soon
as
you
leave
the
brush
in
order
to
surprise
the
enemy.
Use
the
second
cast
(or
the
third,
if
evolved)
for
its
mobility
in
case
you
need
to
chase
or
flee.
If
you
evolve
Leap
its
cooldown
refreshes
on
kill
or
assist.
You
can
double
(or
even
triple,
quadra,
or
penta)
jump
if
you
leave
wounded
(including
damage
from
you)
enemy
to
be
killed
by
your
allies.
In
this
case
you
jump
just
before
your
foe
dies
and
seconds
after
cooldown
of
your
leap
is
refreshed
meaning
you
can
jump
multiple
times.
Use
this
trick
to
surprise
your
prey
when
they
leave
their
allies
to
death
not
expecting
you
travel
such
a
great
distance
in
such
a
short
time.
When
you
evolve
abilities
you
are
adapting
for
4
different
play
styles:
Evolving
Taste
Their
Fear
grants
you
massive
burst
damage
against
isolated
champions
on
low
health;
useful
for
counter
jungling,
defending
against
opposing
counter
jungling
or
landing
a
quicker
killing
blow
on
an
isolated
champion.
Evolving
Void
Spike
grants
you
a
very
powerful
harass
and
farming
potential
early
game.
The
slow
works
both
defensively
and
offensively
to
slow
enemy
champions.
The
explosive
radius
of
Void
Spike
is
effectively
tripled,
if
shot
correctly,
allowing
for
maximum
damage
output.
(Enemies
can
only
be
damaged
by
one
explosion,
the
same
goes
for
the
heal
on
Kha'Zix
)
Evolving
Leap
grants
you
immense
ganking
potential,
due
to
the
extreme
range
(roughly
two
times
Flash
)
and
the
instant
refresh
on
killing/assisting
a
champion.
A
useful
tactic
is
to
jump
to
an
isolated
enemy,
slow
them
with
Unseen
Threat
,
do
maximum
damage
with
Taste
Their
Fear
and
following
the
kill
your
Leap
will
be
ready
for
another
gank.
Evolving
Void
Assault
grants
you
an
extra
use
of
the
Ultimate
before
going
on
cooldown;
essentially
granting
you
an
additional
use
of
the
passive,
the
speed
bonus
and
1
more
second
of
stealth.
It
will
also
grant
you
a
nice
damage
reduction
from
all
sources
except
true
damage,
including
poison
from
Singed
or
Teemo
and
AoE
burst
damage.
However,
timing
is
critical,
as
the
reduction
only
lasts
for
the
1
second
periods
of
stealth.
Build
Usage
The
Black
Cleaver
is
a
very
good
item,
as
it
grants
Kha'Zix
all
the
core
stats
he
needs
to
perform
his
role
as
an
assassin.
When
going
top,
its
possible
to
get
a
Spirit
of
the
Elder
Lizard
.
The
DoT
passive
is
good
for
exchanging
damage
in
lane,
and
the
increased
damage
on
monsters
helps
when
you
steal
camps
from
the
enemy
jungler.
It
is
a
good
idea
to
get
Mercurial
Scimitar
if
laning
against
heavy
magic
damage
dealers
such
as
Rumble
or
heavy
crowd
control
champions
like
Zac
.
When
laning
in
mid
lane,
consider
buying
a
Hexdrinker
against
burst
mages
such
as
Leblanc
or
Brand
to
help
you
survive
their
combo,
then
later
upgrade
it
to
Maw
of
Malmortius
for
better
assassination.
Building
Trinity
Force
on
Kha'Zix
if
you
are
doing
well
is
an
excellent
choice.
Because
of
its
movement
speed
boost,
damage-multiplier
and
higher
crit
chance
it
synergises
well
with
his
two
main
damage
sources:
his
auto-attacks
and
his
Taste
Their
Fear
.
Trinity
Force
also
procs
the
damage
buff
every
time
you
activate
Void
Assault
,
if
you
wait
for
the
two-second
cooldown
of
the
item
between
one
activation
and
another.
So
if
you
evolve
Active
Camouflage,
when
you
use
your
ultimate
you'll
get
three
bursts
of
damage
within
4-5
seconds.
However,
if
going
a
more
defensive
route,
Iceborn
Gauntlet
can
be
very
effective
with
the
added
armor
and
cooldown
reduction,
and
is
a
great
alternative
if
you
can't
get
the
gold
for
a
Trinity
Force
fast
enough.
The
added
slow
can
also
help
isolate
champions
better
by
zoning
them
out
and
focusing
in
on
them.
Kha'Zix
benefits
much
more
from
spell
vamp
than
he
does
from
lifesteal.
Out
of
all
the
spell
vamp
items,
the
one
most
viable
at
the
moment
on
Kha'Zix
is
Hextech
Gunblade
.
Although
AP
should
not
be
a
priority
on
him,
it
is
by
no
means
wasted
thanks
to
the
strong
heal
from
Void
Spike
and
the
damage
from
Unseen
Threat
,
both
of
which
he
should
be
constantly
procing.
He
can
build
a
Bilgewater
Cutlass
early,
and
it
can
be
upgraded
to
Hextech
Gunblade
later
in
the
game
when
cost
efficiency
is
not
that
much
of
an
issue.
Apart
from
the
stats,
the
active
from
both
items
is
very
useful.
Spirit
Visage
provides
cheap
mid-game
stats
and
gives
additional
healing
from
Void
Spike
and
any
lifesteal
or
spell
vamp
you
have
built.
The
Bloodthirster
can
be
an
impressively
devastating
item
to
stack
on
Kha'Zix
as
with
a
few
fully
stacked
Taste
Their
Fear
will
easily
achieve
1000+
base
damage
on
isolated
targets.
Stacking
The
Bloodthirster
will
also
grant
massive
sustain
from
a
few
auto
attacks,
but
be
wary,
as
they
are
no
substitution
for
defensive
items
if
you
can't
survive
the
initial
retaliation
from
enemies.
A
lack
of
movement
speed
could
also
be
a
possible
downside
to
this
strategy
requiring
a
skilled
use
of
brush
and
Unseen
Threat
to
keep
meatier
enemies
in
range.
Tiamat
is
great
on
jungling
with
Kha'Zix,
along
with
ganks.
The
extra
attack
damage
scales
with
his
abilities,
and
the
60%
splash
damage
helps
isolate
larger
jungle
creeps
in
order
to
maximize
damage.
Also,
the
splash
damage
increases
the
chance
of
isolating
a
ganked
target,
increasing
your
damage
against
them.
Upgrading
it
into
a
Ravenous
Hydra
can
be
very
effective
for
mid-late
game
fights.
However,
do
be
aware
Kha'Zix
relies
on
taking
down
targets
who
are
isolated
away
from
their
team,
so
the
splash
damage
may
be
less
effective
if
going
for
an
assassin
play
style.

Their
Fear
deals

damage
to
targets
that
are
isolated.
Take
the
advantage
by
fighting
near
allied
minions,
champions,
or
turrets.
Leap
and
Void
Assault
have
long
cooldowns
and
Kha'Zix
is
very
vulnerable
when
these
are
not
available.
Don't
fight
against
Kha'Zix
near
brush,
as
Unseen
Threat
resets
each
time
you
lose
sight
of
him,
allowing
him
to
increase
his
damage
output
by
moving
in
and
out
of
the
brush.
Kha'Zix's
appearance
changes
slightly
every
time
he
evolves;
watching
him
closely
can
give
you
a
warning
as
to
which
of
his
abilities
are
evolved.

his
claws
are
longer
and
serrated,
then
Kha'Zix
has
evolved
Taste
Their
Fear
,
Gaining
bonus
damage
for
it
and
his
passive
Unseen
Threat
along
with
increased
basic
attack
range.
If
the
two
rows
of
spikes
on
his
shoulders
have
gotten
bigger
then
Kha'Zix
has
evolved
Void
Spike
,
causing
him
to
shoot
three
pairs
of
spikes
instead
of
one,
covering
a
wider
area.
If
a
pair
of
wings
are
stretching
out
of
his
back,
then
Kha'Zix
has
evolved
Leap
,
greatly
increasing
its
range
and
instantly
refreshing
it
if
he
gets
a
kill
or
assist.
If
Kha'Zix's
body
has
changed
color
then
he
has
evolved
Void
Assault
,
allowing
him
to
cast
it
three
times
before
going
on
cooldown
instead
of
two
and
takes
reduced
damage.
Note
that
all
these
evolutions
will
also
show
up
as
buffs
if
you
click
on
Kha'Zix
himself.
When
laning
against
Kha'Zix
,
placing
wards
in
the
bushes
can
prevent
him
from
using
his
passive
Unseen
Threat
,
reducing
his
overall
damage
output.
