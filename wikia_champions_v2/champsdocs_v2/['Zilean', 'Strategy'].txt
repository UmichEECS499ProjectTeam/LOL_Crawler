Placing
Time
Bomb
on
allied
initiators
such
as
Malphite
,
Hecarim
,
and
Amumu
as
they
are
about
to
initiate
on
multiple
enemies
is
a
good
way
to
help
rack
up
burst
damage.
Using
Time
Bombs
on
Evelynn
,
Shaco
,
Rengar
,
KhaZix
,
Talon
,
Wukong
,
or
Twitch
can
lead
to
a
heavy
unexpected
nuke
to
the
enemy
team,
thanks
to
these
characters'
ability
to
stealth.
Placing
a
Time
Bomb
on
an
enemy
Malzahar's
pet
Voidling
will
cause
it
to
follow
him
if
he
walks
away
from
his
pet.
This
is
great
placement
for
a
no-escape
harass
or
instant
kill
at
low
health.
Also
consider
Annie's
pet
bear
Tibbers.
After
triggering
an
enemy
Zac's
passive,
Cell
Division
,
place
one
bomb
on
one
bloblet
and
another
bomb
on
a
different
bloblet.
As
the
timer
ticks
down,
the
bombs
will
get
crawl
closer
together
and
more
likely
finish
him
off.
However
if
you
quickly
double
bomb
one
bloblet
before
the
rest
get
close,
only
one
bloblet
will
be
killed,
and
Zac
will
revive.
Placing
a
Time
Bomb
on
an
ally
as
they
teleport
(
Shen
,
Pantheon
,
Nocturne
etc.)
may
help
you
get
an
assist.
Placing
a
Time
Bomb
on
an
enemy
as
they
teleport
may
also
get
you
a
kill
as
they
will
most
likely
be
teleporting
to
a
fight.
You
can
combine
the
use
of
Time
Bomb
and
Rewind
to
place
two
Time
Bombs
on
a
target
quickly.
As
this
causes
the
first
bomb
to
instantly
explode,
this
is
Zilean's
main
damage
combo.
If
the
first
bomb
is
enough
to
kill
the
target,
both
bombs
will
explode.
This
can
be
very
effective
for
farming
and
pushing.
This
combo
costs
a
lot
of
mana
,
so
you
may
not
want
to
use
it
for
harassing.
This
strategy
can
be
a
good
way
to
damage
enemy
champions
standing
near
the
target
before
they
have
a
chance
to
shield
themselves
from
damage.
This
strategy
has
an
effect
on
an
enemy
Zilean's
bombs
because
planting
your
own
bombs
on
debuffed
allies
will
detonate
the
enemy
bombs.
Using
bombs
on
your
own
or
enemy
minions,
is
a
good
way
of
zoning
your
opponent.
If
the
enemy
champion
is
melee,
they
have
to
either
wait
4
seconds
for
the
bomb
to
explode,
or
be
damaged
by
the
bomb
if
they
choose
to
farm
that
minion.
Pizza
Delivery:
When
sieging
an
enemy
turret,
have
your
allied
champions
clear
the
enemy
minion
wave.
Place
a
bomb
on
the
2nd
and
3rd
melee
minion
in
your
ally
minion
column.
They
will
carry
the
bombs
forwards
for
you,
possibly
harassing
a
careless
opponent
under
their
tower.
Zilsta
Insta
Clear:
When
Zilean
has
enough
AP
to
kill
melee
minions
with
a
QWQ
combo,
he
can
iInsta-clear
all
6
by
walking
ahead
of
his
minions
to
the
enemy
minion
line,
then
lead
the
melee
minions
towards
the
faster
minions.
QWQ
combo
on
a
faster
minion
will
clear
the
entire
wave.
Consider
enemy
champions
shield
durations
or
damage
reductions
when
casting
time
bomb.
For
example,
after
Katarina
casts
shunpo,
she
takes
15%
reduced
damage
for
1.5
seconds.
Therefore
placing
a
single
bomb
on
her
after
shunpo
will
detonate
4
seconds
later,
with
no
damage
reduction
from
shunpo.
Or,
placing
a
single
bomb
immediately,
then
waiting
for
the
shunpo
damage
reduction
to
wear
off
before
the
casting
the
second
bomb
will
also
avoid
damage
reduction
from
shunpo.
Another
example
is
LeeSin
's
Safeguard
,
which
shields
LeeSin
and
an
ally
champion
for
5
seconds.
If
Zilean
casts
Time
Bomb
on
LeeSin
directly,
he
can
safeguard
any
time
before
the
bomb
goes
off
to
mitigate
the
damage.
However,
if
LeeSin
casts
safeguard
while
farming
for
example,
mentally
count
to
1
before
placing
a
Time
Bomb
on
LeeSin
.
The
safeguard
shield
will
expire
before
the
four
second
countdown
of
Time
Bomb
,
thus
taking
full
damage.
This
is
a
more
mana
efficient
method
of
harass,
compared
to
double
bombing
him
while
his
shield
is
still
active.
Also,
now
that
Safeguard
is
on
cooldown
for
9
seconds,
there
is
a
time
window
where
Zilean
may
be
able
bomb
him
before
he
is
able
to
shield
the
second
bomb
as
well.
With
minor
cooldown
reduction
and
Rewind
,
you
can
keep
higher
ranks
of
Time
Warp
on
yourself
permanently
barring
mana
costs.
Use
this
to
quickly
get
to
teamfights
to
help,
or
lanes
to
defend/push.
Repeated
usage
of
Rewind
can
help
to
drastically
reduce
the
cooldown
of
Chrono
Shift
at
the
cost
of
mana.
Using
Time
Bomb
and
Rewind
can
become
a
reliable
farming
strategy
with
higher
ranks
invested
in
them.
Place
one
on
a
caster
minion,
then
quickly
place
another.
The
bomb
should
have
done
enough
damage
to
leave
the
caster
minion
at
low
health.
Land
an
auto
attack
on
it
to
set
the
bomb
off
sooner.
Against
melee
champs,
you
can
place
a
time
bomb
on
your
own
minion
that
is
low
on
life
just
before
they
hit
it
to
CS.
This
is
a
very
safe
way
to
harass
them
if
they
have
a
similar
range
such
as
Kassadin
's
Q
(650)
or
Katarina
's
Shunpo
(700)
This
same
technique
can
be
used
to
harass
them
under
their
own
tower
without
taking
tower
hits
as
well.
Use
Time
Warp
to
get
back
to
lane
faster.
Time
Warp
is
an
effective
way
to
enable
allies/yourself
to
finish
off
enemies,
engage
enemies,
or
escape
from
a
losing
battle.
By
using
Rewind
,
Zilean
can
slow
or
boost
an
enemy
or
ally
twice
allowing
an
easy
kill
or
escape.
Placing
Time
Warp
on
a
initiator
such
as
Singed
,
Hecarim
,
Jarvan
IV
,
Udyr
,
Rammus
,
Sejuani
,
and
Volibear
,
while
chasing
an
enemy
champion
running
away,
or
out
of
position
can
allow
the
rest
of
your
team
to
catchup
and
outnumber
them
once
they
are
in
range
to
apply
their
CC.
Rewind
is
Zilean's
only
ability
that
is
insta-cast.
Casting
another
ability
then
Rewind
in
a
quick
sequence
may
end
up
the
Rewind
being
cast
earlier,
hence
the
ability
input
next
unaffected
by
Rewind
as
expected.
Use
Chrono
Shift
strategically
for
maximum
effect.
It
can
prolong
the
life
span
of
yourself
or
a
team
member.
You
can
bait
low
enemies
to
your
tower
by
saving
your
Chrono
Shift
till
the
last
second
to
bait
enemies
into
committing
to
kill
you
or
die.
Typically
it
is
better
to
save
your
ult
for
an
AD
carry
or
tanky
DPS,
don't
use
it
to
save
a
support
unless
you
can
tell
the
team
fight
is
almost
over
and
no
one
else
needs
it.
If
the
enemy
team
focuses
you,
use
it
to
ult
yourself
of
course.
If
you
save
it
you
might
die
and
not
be
able
to
use
it
at
all.
The
benefit
is
the
damage
and
CC
you
have
absorbed
only
to
come
back
to
life.
It
can
be
difficult
to
cast
chronoshift
on
the
ally
teammate
you
want
during
a
team
fight
due
to
champions
being
on
top
of
each
other,
visual
effects
of
spells,
and
losing
your
mouse
cursor.
Casting
the
spell
on
your
allies
portrait
in
the
upper
left
corner
of
the
screen
will
avoid
this
problem.
If
zilean
is
out
of
range,
he
will
walk
torwards
them
until
he
is
in
range
and
then
automatically
cast
the
spell.
Spam
Rewind
to
reduce
the
CD
of
Chrono
Shift
so
you
can
use
it
in
almost
every
team
fight.
In
team
fights,
Zilean
can
safely
speed
the
ally
ADC
to
help
them
kite
back
and
forth,
and
chronoshift
the
allied
ADC
as
a
type
of
peel
by
remaining
behind
the
allied
ADC
or
to
the
side
of
them.
Also,
Zilean
can
slow
anyone
trying
to
get
to
the
allied
ADC
as
well,
however
it
only
works
on
one
opposing
champion,
so
with
multiple
opposing
champions
rushing
your
allied
ADC
it
may
be
more
effective
to
speed
your
allied
ADC
instead.
When
ganking
or
chasing,
placing
a
Time
Warp
(range
700)
will
enable
Zilean
to
be
in
range
to
pull
off
the
rest
of
his
combo
since
his
Q
is
also
ranged
700.
If
Zilean
Qs
first,
that
may
be
the
only
spell
you
can
cast
before
they
run
out
of
range.
Slow
first!
Then
QWQ.
When
chasing,
if
not
in
range
to
time
warp
the
opposing
champion,
and
your
allied
champion
is
ahead
of
you,
speed
them
instead
so
they
can
CC
the
runner
and
everyone
else
can
catch
up
to
them.
Placing
Time
Bomb
on
a
minion
and
then
having
an
ally
use
a
knockback
ability
on
the
minion
(such
as
Headbutt
or
Buster
Shot)
into
an
enemy
champion
can
deal
long-range
damage
or
finish
of
fleeing
enemies.
Build
usage
Building
ability
power
is
recommended,
due
to
the
high
AP
ratios
on
the
damage
from
Time
Bomb
and
the
revive
from
Chrono
Shift
.
Since
all
of
Zilean's
abilities
are
spammable
but
mana-heavy,
you
might
find
yourself
quickly
running
out
of
mana
in
the
early
stages
of
the
game.
To
aid
this,
purchase
Tear
of
the
Goddess
for
decent
mana
regeneration
and
for
early
harassment
,
which
can
be
later
upgraded
into
an
Archangel's
Staff
.
This
is
especially
useful
if
one
is
also
building
other
items
providing
mana
like
Frozen
Heart
or
Rod
of
Ages
.
For
support
builds,
this
leaves
more
room
for
other
items,
as
this
is
essentially
the
only
offensive
item
a
support
Zilean
would
need.
Another
option
is
to
grab
an
early
Chalice
of
Harmony
.
Its
upgrade,
Athene's
Unholy
Grail
provides
a
lot
of
ability
power
and
cooldown
reduction
,
among
other
stats
which
are
very
useful
on
Zilean
.
By
purchasing
Guardian
Angel
and
using
his
ultimate,
he
can
be
a
great
time
consumer
to
the
opposing
team,
which
allows
the
ally
team
to
know
how
to
approach
an
ambush
while
you
are
reviving.
Though,
keep
in
mind
that
Guardian
Angel's
passive
will
always
proc
after
Chrono
Shift's
active,
and
generally
will
resurrect
you
with
a
much
lower
amount
of
health
than
your
ultimate.
Cooldown
reduction
is
doubly
effective
on
Zilean
,
since
in
addition
to
decreasing
the
cooldowns
of
his
abilities
it
decreases
the
cooldown
of
Rewind
allowing
it
to
be
used
more
often
to
decrease
the
cooldowns
on
your
abilities
even
further.
You
can
use
Chrono
Shift
every
28
seconds
with
maximum
cooldown
reduction
and
continual
activation
of
Rewind
.
A
cooldown
reduction
of
9%
allows
Time
Warp
to
be
continually
active.
Morellonomicon
provides
ability
power
,
mana
regeneration
,
and
cooldown
reduction
,
all
of
which
are
very
useful
to
Zilean.
A
second
choice
for
all
the
above
stats
is
the
aforementioned
Athene's
Unholy
Grail
.
Its
passive
component
restores
12%
of
your
maximum
mana
on
kill
or
assist,
and
the
item
itself
provides
more
mana
regeneration
than
Morellonomicon
,
as
well
as
a
decent
amount
of
magic
resistance
,
but
less
ability
power
and
no
Grievous
Wounds
debuff.
Although
it
may
give
better
stats
the
gold
price
is
also
higher
(by
400g).
Void
Staff
vs
Lich
Bane
Lich
Bane
will
give
you
a
large
increase
in
DPS,
however,
will
be
riskier
in
teamfightss
to
get
close
enough
to
keep
throwing
AAs,
as
well
as
slowing
your
burst
damage
if
you
want
to
AA
between
each
spell.
Lich
Bane
will
also
allow
Zilean
to
push
down
turrets
and
inhibitors
much
faster.
Void
Staff
will
increase
your
burst
damage
is
a
safer
choice
in
team
fights
as
you
can
stay
away
from
the
team
fight
more
easily.

Countering
Zilean's
early
harassment
power
can
be
mitigated
by
sending
a
tanky
or
healing
champion
to
lane
against
him.
You
are
more
likely
to
win
a
battle
of
attrition
due
to
his
high
early
mana
costs.
Champions
with
the
ability
to
silence
also
have
a
upper
hand
on
Zilean
due
to
his
low
defense
stats
When
caught
by
Zilean's
Time
Bomb
,
you
can
force
him
to
push
the
lane
by
intentionally
damaging
your
minions
with
the
explosion.
Remember
to
stay
away
from
your
allies
when
he
uses
his
Time
Bomb
on
you
so
you
won't
unintentionally
damage
them.
Ideally
you
should
attempt
to
take
Zilean
down
quickly
with
enough
burst
power
to
prevent
him
from
making
use
of
Chrono
Shift
.
If
this
proves
impossible,
consider
that
you
may
need
to
focus
on
which
of
Zilean's
allies
you
can
kill
the
fastest
over
which
one
is
dealing
the
most
damage.
Zilean's
mobility
with
Time
Warp
makes
it
difficult
to
finish
him
off
without
a
well-orchestrated
ambush,
for
he
can
easily
bait
and
win
a
fight
with
Chrono
Shift
.
However,
his
low
natural
defences
make
good
targets
for
assassins.
Time
Warp
is
one
of
the
strongest
and
longest
lasting
movement
speed
reduction
abilities
in
the
game.
The
duration
reduction
from
Mercury's
Treads
is
noticeable
at
all
levels.
Zilean
cannot
usually
afford
to
increase
his
ability
damage
in
the
late
game
and
his
utility
is
less
dependent
on
his
item
build.
Attempting
to
kill
Zilean
during
the
laning
phase
should
be
a
very
low
priority
compared
to
farming
minions.
Chrono
Shift
is
less
useful
versus
teams
with
high
sustained
damage
combined
with
crowd
control
like
Kassadin
and
Jax
.
Zilean
is
heavily
susceptible
to
silence
effects.
If
you
have
enough
silence
in
team,
you
can
try
to
silence
Zilean
when
he
is
about
to
cast
Chrono
Shift
on
one
of
his
allies
or
kill
him
before
he
can
use
it
on
himself.
Various
champions
that
have
abilities
that
make
them
untargetable
can
prevent
the
damage
from
Time
Bomb
,
such
as
Elise
,
Fiora
,
Fizz
,
Lissandra
,
Maokai
,
Master
Yi
,
Shaco
,
Vladimir
or
Zed
.
Building
a
Hexdrinker
,
Zhonya's
Hourglass
,
or
Elixir
of
Fortitude
could
save
you
if
you
get
bombed
twice
and
are
running
away.
The
shield
from
Hexdrinker
will
activate
before
the
2nd
bomb
detonates.
Activate
Zhonya's
Hourglass
when
the
bomb
counts
down
to
1.
