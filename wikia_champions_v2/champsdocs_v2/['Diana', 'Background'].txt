Lore
An
unyielding
avatar
of
the
moon's
power,
Diana
wages
a
dark
crusade
against
the
sun-worshiping
Solari
.
Though
she
once
sought
the
acceptance
of
her
people,
years
of
futile
struggle
shaped
her
into
a
bitter,
resentful
warrior.
She
now
presents
her
foes
with
a
terrible
ultimatum:
revere
the
moon's
light,
or
die
by
her
crescent
blade.
Though
she
was
born
to
the
Solari,
Diana's
inquisitive
nature
set
her
apart
from
her
brethren.
She
had
always
found
solace
and
guidance
in
the
night
sky,
and
questioned
the
dominance
of
the
sun
in
her
society.
The
Solari
elders
responded
to
her
challenges
with
only
derision
and
punishment.
Diana
remained
convinced,
however,
that
if
she
could
find
evidence
of
the
moon's
power,
the
elders
would
listen
to
reason.
For
years,
she
studied
Solari
archives
in
solitude
until
she
discovered
an
encoded
message
hidden
in
an
old
tome.
This
clue
led
her
to
a
secluded
valley
on
Mount
Targon
where
she
unearthed
the
hidden
entrance
to
an
ancient,
sealed
temple.
Inside,
among
aging
relics
and
faded
murals,
she
found
an
ornate
suit
of
armor
and
a
beautiful
crescent
blade,
both
inscribed
with
sigils
of
the
moon.
Diana
donned
the
armaments
and
returned
to
the
Solari
elders
that
night.
She
declared
that
the
artifacts
proved
others
had
once
worshiped
the
moon
as
she
did.
Her
discovery
of
evidence
challenging
Solari
dominion
shocked
the
elders.
To
Diana's
horror,
they
pronounced
her
a
heretic
and
condemned
her
to
death.
As
the
elders
prepared
her
for
execution,
Diana's
anger
and
sorrow
overwhelmed
her
desire
for
acceptance.
She
lifted
her
gaze
to
the
sky,
calling
upon
the
moon
for
strength.
Lunar
power
surged
within
her
and
she
shattered
her
bindings.
Raising
her
relic
blade,
she
turned
and
slaughtered
the
elders.
With
the
temple
in
ruins
behind
her,
Diana
resolved
to
destroy
all
those
who
would
deny
the
power
of
the
moon.
"The
sun
does
not
reveal
truth.
Its
light
only
burns
and
blinds."

Diana

Diana's
sneak
peek
Not
all
creatures
of
the
night
are
the
sort
that
lurk
in
the
shadows.
A
select
few
leap
headlong
into
the
fray,
leaving
enemies
begging
for
sunshine.
Shunned
by
the
people
of
the
sun,
Diana
turned
in
isolation
to
the
cold
power
of
the
moon's
glow.
She
hurls
herself
into
the
heat
of
the
fight,
wielding
her
crescent
blade
and
unleashing
lunar
energy
with
merciless
ferocity.
If
you're
awed
by
the
darkness
of
the
night,
but
never
one
to
hide
in
the
shadows,
you're
sure
to
be
drawn
to
this
knight
of
the
moon
and
her
relentless
pursuit
of
vengeance.
Diana,
Scorn
of
the
Moon,
Revealed
Announcement
made
by
NeeksNaman
:
[2]
The
tide
of
battle
is
turning,
summoners.
With
ceaseless
aggression,
powered
and
protected
by
the
lunar
light,
Diana,
Scorn
of
the
Moon,
controls
and
chases
her
enemies
through
the
battlefield,
leaving
them
no
sunlight
for
solace.
Diana's
high
area
of
effect
damage
and
defensive
abilities
make
her
an
ideal
jungler.
Pale
Cascade
creates
three
orbiting
spheres
that
detonate
and
deal
damage
to
any
enemy
that
comes
close,
while
protecting
her
with
a
shield
that
absorbs
any
incoming
damage.
If
all
three
orbs
are
detonated,
the
shield
effect
is
refreshed,
allowing
her
to
absorb
even
more
punishment.
This
destructive
shield,
combined
with
a
cleaving
attack
from
her
passive,
Moonsilver
Blade,
helps
her
deal
out
significant
damage
to
multiple
targets
as
she
quickly
tears
through
jungle
camps.
Drawing
power
from
the
moon,
Diana's
kit
revolves
around
her
use
of
Moonlight
to
prep
her
enemies
for
an
incoming
attack.
The
breakneck
pace
of
Diana's
gameplay
and
her
relentless
chasing
potential
are
driven
by
the
interplay
between
Crescent
Strike
and
her
ultimate
ability,
Lunar
Rush.
A
unique
curved
skillshot,
Crescent
Strike
unleashes
lunar
energy
in
an
arc,
damaging
any
enemies
in
its
path
and
simultaneously
afflicting
them
with
Moonlight.
Casting
Lunar
Rush
to
teleport
to
an
enemy
afflicted
by
Moonlight
will
reset
the
ability
cooldown
while
consuming
all
active
Moonlight
debuffs.
Judicious
use
of
Moonlight
combined
with
accurate
casts
of
Crescen
Strike
gives
Diana
incredible
mobility
and
sustained
damage
throughout
a
long
fight.
While
using
Lunar
Rush
only
in
combination
with
Moonlight
will
give
Diana
the
highest
damage
output
over
time,
you
may
make
a
judgment
call
and
accept
the
longer
cooldown
to
either
directly
rush
a
vulnerable
target
or
double
tap
a
Moonlight
afflicted
enemy
for
heavy
burst
damage.
Diana's
kit
really
comes
together
in
a
team
fight.
After
initiating
with
Crescent
Strike
and
Lunar
Rush,
she
can
follow
up
with
Moonfall,
drawing
in
and
slowing
all
nearby
enemies,
holding
them
in
range
for
Moonsilver
Blade
and
Pale
Cascade
until
Crescent
Strike
is
ready
again.
The
added
durability
of
her
shield
helps
her
survive
heavy
damage,
while
the
mobility
of
a
Moonlight-enhanced
ultimate
helps
her
pursue
and
assassinate
high-value
targets.
With
the
complex
interplay
of
her
abilities,
Diana's
got
the
potential
to
control
the
jungle
while
executing
quick
ganks
and
threatening
enemies
in
team
fights.

The
Creation
of
Diana:
Art,
Story
and
Sound
Announcement
made
by
NeeksNaman
:
[3]
Inspiration
for
a
champion’s
artistic
design
comes
from
many
places:
gameplay
mechanics,
champion
personalities
or
a
walk
in
the
wilds,
just
to
name
a
few.
Sometimes
new
champions
are
even
inspired
by
other
champion
stories,
and
so
was
the
case
with
Diana,
Scorn
of
the
Moon.
While
her
artistic
motif
naturally
pays
homage
to
the
moon,
the
art
was
further
influenced
by
her
relationship
with
Leona
and
its
transforming
effect
on
her
personality.
The
artists,
animators,
sound
designers
and
creative
designers
envisioned
Diana
as
a
character
long
before
they
knew
her
as
the
champion
we
see
today.
A
few
of
them
came
together
to
discuss
Diana’s
origins
and
evolution
through
art,
story
and
sound.

IronStylus's
Diana
Portrait
Recently
IronStylus
posted
a
portrait
of
Diana
revealing
interesting
info
about
the
moon
mark
on
her
forehead
quoting
:
"So,
the
super-secret
head-canon
I
have,
which
I
have
no
idea
if
it'll
be
actually
integrated,
but
it's
something
that
Team
Diana
talked
about
way
back
in
the
day..
is
that
her
mark
is
a
physical
brand.
The
Solari
elders
literally
took
a
tool
and
burned
that
mark
into
her
face.
Though,
they
were
so
blinded
by
ignorance,
or
maybe
they
liked
irony
so
much,
that
they
branded
her
with
the
ancient
symbol
of
the
moon.
This
scar
burned
her
hair,
giving
her
a
larger
forehead.
After
she
flipped
out,
surrendering
all
her
humanity
to
deep
sadness
and
pain,
that's
when
this
thing
became
full
of
fancy.
That's
when
her
bond
with
the
moon
began.
The
marks
on
her
eyes
weren't
makeup,
they
were
burn
marks
and
scorches
coming
from
the
magicalmoonlight
affecting
her
eyes
and
causing
her
tears
to
boil
on
her
face.
Soooooo
yeah.
A
little
emo."

Diana's
development
began
with
a
heavily
story-driven
concept
and
along
with
her
aggressive
gameplay,
she's
now
one
of
the
most
anticipated
champions
to
join
the
League.
To
give
you
insight
into
the
story
of
Diana’s
creation,
three
of
her
designers
are
holding
a
Reddit

this
Friday,
beginning

Announcement

In
our
discussion
about
The
Creation
of
Diana
,
we
looked
at
the
how
the
Scorn
of
the
Moon
was
inspired
by
another
story
within
the
League.
This
impact
isn't
limited
to
personality,
art
or
sound.
Diana's
complicated
tale
affected
her
gameplay
as
well.
Her
kit
reflects
her
tragic
story
and
her
relationships
with
Leona,
the
Solari
and
the
moon.
We
spoke
with
a
few
of
the
Designers
involved
in
execution
of
Diana’s
gameplay
and
they
explained
this
aggressive
champion’s
origins.

:
[6]
Whether
you
protect
the
faith
or
embrace
the
heresy,
you'll
enjoy
chasing
and
assassinating
your
enemies
on
the
battlefield
with
Diana,
Scorn
of
the
Moon.
Diana's
stark
beauty
and
aggressive
gameplay
reflect
her
complicated
relationship
with
Leona
and
the
Solari.
Using
her
Crescent
Strike
and
Lunar
Rush
combo,
she
relentlessly
pursues
her
enemies
across
the
battlefield.
She
aids
her
allies
in
team
fights
with
Pale
Cascade
and
Moonfall,
absorbing
damage
and
dragging
foes
back
within
striking
distance.
Your
quick
decision-making
and
strategic
moves
will
make
this
jungling
assassin
shine
in
the
moonlight.
