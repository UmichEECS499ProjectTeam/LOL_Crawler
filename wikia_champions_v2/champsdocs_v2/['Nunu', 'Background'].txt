As
unlikely
a
pair
as
anyone
could
find,
Nunu
and
Willump
relied
on
courage
and
tenacity
to
drive
them
through
countless
troubles
in
the
Freljord.
The
boy
and
his
Yeti
searched
far
and
wide
for
a
place
they’d
both
be
welcome,
and
eventually
found
a
home
among
the
Avarosan.
Sometimes
bonds
of
friendship
become
stronger
than
even
bonds
of
blood.
When
those
bonds
link
a
fearless
boy
to
a
fearsome
Yeti,
the
bond
becomes
a
force
to
be
reckoned
with.
Given
the
responsibility
of
taming
a
terrifying
beast,
Nunu
forged
a
friendship
where
others
would
have
forged
chains.
Now
Nunu
and
his
burly
pal
Willump
are
an
inseparable
pair
who
combine
youthful
exuberance
and
brute
strength
with
the
mythical
powers
of
the
Yeti
to
overcome
obstacles
insurmountable
to
any
ordinary
duo.
Nunu
had
only
the
vaguest
memories
of
his
parents
or
the
time
before
he
was
part
of
the
reclusive
Frostguard
tribe.
Never
welcome
among
his
caretakers,
Nunu's
wanderlust
and
compassion
often
put
him
at
odds
with
the
tribe's
elders
and
the
boy
frequently
dreamed
of
places
far
beyond
the
shadow
of
the
Frostguard
citadel.
Sometimes
he
would
do
more
than
just
dream,
much
to
the
frustration
of
his
minders.
This
was
never
more
apparent
than
when
Nunu
was
apprenticed
to
the
tribe's
beast
master
and
charged
with
the
care
of
the
creatures
under
his
yoke.
The
Frostguard
held
a
menagerie
of
the
Freljord's
wildlife
at
their
beck
and
call,
but
unique
among
their
collection
was
the
Yeti:
an
uncommon
creature
with
mystical
qualities
and
raw
physical
strength.
The
beastmaster
taught
Nunu
that
it
was
only
a
lean
diet
of
plants
and
regular
whippings
that
kept
the
vicious
beast
tame,
but
the
more
time
Nunu
spent
caring
for
the
creature,
the
more
he
learned
that
the
Yeti
was
no
feral
monster.
As
he
saw
his
new
friend
Willump
growing
weaker
and
sicker,
Nunu
began
to
sneak
the
Yeti
scraps
of
meat,
hoping
to
restore
his
health.
Day
by
day,
Willump
grew
stronger
and
not
the
slightest
bit
savage
contrary
to
the
beastmaster's
claims.
Nunu
had
hopes
of
convincing
him
that
the
Yeti
possessed
no
danger,
but
it
wasn't
meant
to
be.
The
next
time
Nunu
came
to
deliver
Willump
a
meal,
he
found
the
Yeti's
cage
shattered,with
only
a
crude
drawing
inside
signaling
the
Yeti's
farewell.
Without
hesitation,
Nunu
rushed
into
the
wilderness
in
search
of
his
friend.
When
Nunu
finally
caught
up
to
Willump,
he
found
the
Yeti
cornered
by
the
beastmaster
alongside
a
group
of
Frostguard
warriors.
Afraid
that
the
men
would
hurt
his
friend,
Nunu
threw
himself
between
the
Yeti
and
the
beastmaster's
lash,
but
the
brutal
man
would
not
stay
his
hand.
As
the
furious
beastmaster
raised
his
whip
once
more,
the
Yeti
swelled
up
with
uncharacteristic
fury.
Even
after
so
much
mistreatment,
it
wasn't
concern
for
himself
but
for
the
boy
who'd
shown
him
kindness
that
finally
pushed
Willump
too
far.
The
Yeti
raged
and
left
the
man
bloodied
in
the
snow.
Terrified
by
Willump's
fury,
the
remaining
Frostguard
warriors
fled.
Nunu
realized
there
was
no
going
back.
He
yelled
at
Willump
to
run
before
the
men
returned
to
kill
him,
but
the
Yeti
refused
to
leave
the
young
boy.
Nunu
was
faced
with
a
hard
choice:
abandon
his
sole
friend
and
lead
a
life
of
captivity
with
the
Frostguard,or
strike
out
into
the
harsh
wilds
and
leave
behind
the
only
home
he
knew.
Nunu
chose
the
only
path
that
made
sense.
Leaping
onto
the
back
of
the
mighty
Yeti,
Nunu
joined
Willump
in
his
great
escape.
The
pair
took
their
first
steps
into
the
wide
world
from
which
they
had
been
kept
for
so
long.
"Willump
and
I
have
a
whole
world
to
explore.
Don't
get
in
our
way!"
―
Nunu
Freljord
is
an
unforgiving
land
covered
in
snow
and
ice.
Travel,
especially
in
the
winter,
can
be
very
dangerous.
The
elements
often
claim
even
those
who
have
spent
their
entire
lives
there.
The
boy
known
as
Nunu
is
defined
by
such
tragedy.
One
day
when
he
was
a
young
child,
Nunu
rode
on
his
father's
back
as
they
returned
from
a
trapping
expedition
in
the
mountains.
An
unexpected
blizzard
came
upon
them,
forcing
them
to
seek
refuge
in
a
cave.
The
tempest
was
the
worst
in
countless
years,
and
it
lasted
for
days.
Nunu's
father
left
to
find
food,
but
he
never
returned.
The
blizzard
eventually
cleared,
and
the
young
child
lay
dying
on
the
mountainside.
Fortunately
for
Nunu,
this
was
the
land
of
the
yetis,
who
are
powerful
beasts
with
whom
Nunu's
father
had
secured
an
arrangement
for
safe
passage.
A
young
yeti
boy
named
Willump
found
Nunu
and
brought
him
home.
From
then
on
Nunu
was
raised
by
the
yetis,
whose
culture
remains
a
mystery
to
most
Runeterrans
.
The
boy
quickly
discovered
that
the
seemingly
savage
creatures
were
in
fact
deeply
spiritual
beings
living
in
harmony
with
their
environment.
They
are
very
territorial
and
unafraid
of
defending
themselves
if
called
upon
to
do
so.
The
yetis
have
watched
the
rest
of
Valoran
,
and
they
can
smell
the
change
on
the
wind.
When
the
League
of
Legends
was
formed,
the
yetis
knew
they
needed
a
champion
.
Riding
his
brother
Willump,
Nunu
became
that
champion.
Those
who
follow
the
League
know
that
the
boy
is
mature
beyond
his
years,
but,
while
he
appears
human,
his
mind
is
that
of
his
adoptive
kin.
If
this
is
him
now,
imagine
what
Nunu
will
be
like
when
he
grows
up!

The
Legendary
Nunu
Bot
This
Monday,
the
minds
that
brought
you
Gentleman
Cho'gath
and
Corporate
Mundo
have
a
very
special
surprise
in
store
for
you:
The
Legendary
Nunu
Bot!
Deep
within
Freljord's
numerous
mountain
ranges
lies
the
top
secret
AngryGoran
Robotics
Facility.
There
the
most
brilliant
(and
angry)
minds
in
all
of
Runeterra
work
to
achieve
with
science
that
which
nature
has
failed
to
provide.
Their
mission:
To
build
the
perfect
Yeti!
Decades
(and
numerous
home
video
production
cycles)
have
passed
since
their
first
attempts.
Now,
after
thousands
of
failed
prototypes,
power
outages,
welding
accidents,
patent
office
claims,
and
a
rather
considerable
electricity
bill,
AngryGoran
engineers
have
finally
completed
construction
on
the
next
evolution
of
fully
functional
combat
Yeti.
Nunu
Bot
is
officially
operational
and
ready
to
be
deployed
to
the
Fields
of
Justice!
This
May
2nd,
visit
the
League
of
Legends
store
and
fire
up
your
very
own
Nunu
Bot!
