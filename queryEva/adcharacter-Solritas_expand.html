Well,
the
Hydrosoul
aka
The
Water
Wizard
is
a
canceled
champion
in
League
of
Legends.
[1]
Background
Lore
Soterios
gathered
men
and
would
toss
them
below
the
thrashing
waves
until
water
filled
the
poor
soul's
lungs
and
he
was
rendered
unconscious.
Soterios
would
then
proceed
to
then
Rebirth
the
lost
man
by
bringing
him
back
to
shore,
and
pressing
his
holy
hands
upon
the
victim's
chest
until
he
was
brought
back
choking
and
coughing,
reborn
into
the
world
as
acolytes
to
the
High
Priest.
For
years
Soterios
conducted
his
Rituals
of
Rebirth
unchallenged.
Grown
fanatical
in
his
success
with
the
Rituals,
Soterios
was
sure
in
his
belief
that
his
own
Rebirth
would
result
in
a
divine
transformation
of
his
body,
elevating
him
to
an
even
higher
level
of
power.
At
a
command
from
Soterios,
his
acolytes
lowered
the
High
Priest
into
the
cold,
dark
sea.
Unfortunately,
his
Rebirth
did
not
go
as
planned
and
as
water
filled
his
lungs,
the
dying
High
Priest
made
one
last
plea
to
the
higher
powers.
Reborn
by
the
Immortals,
he
renamed
himself
Well,
the
Hydrosoul,
and
lives
only
to
do
their
bidding.
Speculation
on
the
Water
Mage
Possibly
a
recent
undertaking
of
Riot
after
a
post
in
the
TR
forums
requested
that
there
be
an
&quot;all
water
using
character&quot;
also
asking
if
Riot
had
the
technology
for
the
effects.
There
has
been
no
announcement
and
no
posts
on
TR
since
so
that
this
character
is
classed
as
a
rumor.

The
&quot;Ritual
of
Rebirth&quot;
mentioned
in
Well's
backstory
is
incredibly
similar
to
Damphair,
a
character
from
George
Martin's
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
book
series.
Damphair
worships
an
entity
called
the
Drowned
God
and
'baptizes'
others
by
holding
them
underwater
and
then
resuscitating
them
afterwards.
Trivia
The
ability
icon
for
Vortex
was
reused
for
the
previous
icon
of
the
Crest
of
Crushing
Wrath
,
which
is
obtained
from
killing
Ebonmaw
on
The
Twisted
Treeline
.
It
was
also
reused
as
the
Attack
Damage
buff
icon
for
Janna's
Eye
of
the
Storm
.
The
ability
icon
for
Typhoon
has
been
reused
for
the
Crest
of
Flowing
Water
buff,
which
was
obtained
from
killing
the
Ghast
on
The
Twisted
Treeline
.

Well,
the
Hydrosoul
aka
The
Water
Wizard
is
a
canceled
champion
in
League
of
Legends.
[1]
Background
Lore
Soterios
gathered
men
and
would
toss
them
below
the
thrashing
waves
until
water
filled
the
poor
soul's
lungs
and
he
was
rendered
unconscious.
Soterios
would
then
proceed
to
then
Rebirth
the
lost
man
by
bringing
him
back
to
shore,
and
pressing
his
holy
hands
upon
the
victim's
chest
until
he
was
brought
back
choking
and
coughing,
reborn
into
the
world
as
acolytes
to
the
High
Priest.
For
years
Soterios
conducted
his
Rituals
of
Rebirth
unchallenged.
Grown
fanatical
in
his
success
with
the
Rituals,
Soterios
was
sure
in
his
belief
that
his
own
Rebirth
would
result
in
a
divine
transformation
of
his
body,
elevating
him
to
an
even
higher
level
of
power.
At
a
command
from
Soterios,
his
acolytes
lowered
the
High
Priest
into
the
cold,
dark
sea.
Unfortunately,
his
Rebirth
did
not
go
as
planned
and
as
water
filled
his
lungs,
the
dying
High
Priest
made
one
last
plea
to
the
higher
powers.
Reborn
by
the
Immortals,
he
renamed
himself
Well,
the
Hydrosoul,
and
lives
only
to
do
their
bidding.
Speculation
on
the
Water
Mage
Possibly
a
recent
undertaking
of
Riot
after
a
post
in
the
TR
forums
requested
that
there
be
an
&quot;all
water
using
character&quot;
also
asking
if
Riot
had
the
technology
for
the
effects.
There
has
been
no
announcement
and
no
posts
on
TR
since
so
that
this
character
is
classed
as
a
rumor.

The
&quot;Ritual
of
Rebirth&quot;
mentioned
in
Well's
backstory
is
incredibly
similar
to
Damphair,
a
character
from
George
Martin's
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
book
series.
Damphair
worships
an
entity
called
the
Drowned
God
and
'baptizes'
others
by
holding
them
underwater
and
then
resuscitating
them
afterwards.
Trivia
The
ability
icon
for
Vortex
was
reused
for
the
previous
icon
of
the
Crest
of
Crushing
Wrath
,
which
is
obtained
from
killing
Ebonmaw
on
The
Twisted
Treeline
.
It
was
also
reused
as
the
Attack
Damage
buff
icon
for
Janna's
Eye
of
the
Storm
.
The
ability
icon
for
Typhoon
has
been
reused
for
the
Crest
of
Flowing
Water
buff,
which
was
obtained
from
killing
the
Ghast
on
The
Twisted
Treeline
.

Well,
the
Hydrosoul
aka
The
Water
Wizard
is
a
canceled
champion
in
League
of
Legends.
[1]
Background
Lore
Soterios
gathered
men
and
would
toss
them
below
the
thrashing
waves
until
water
filled
the
poor
soul's
lungs
and
he
was
rendered
unconscious.
Soterios
would
then
proceed
to
then
Rebirth
the
lost
man
by
bringing
him
back
to
shore,
and
pressing
his
holy
hands
upon
the
victim's
chest
until
he
was
brought
back
choking
and
coughing,
reborn
into
the
world
as
acolytes
to
the
High
Priest.
For
years
Soterios
conducted
his
Rituals
of
Rebirth
unchallenged.
Grown
fanatical
in
his
success
with
the
Rituals,
Soterios
was
sure
in
his
belief
that
his
own
Rebirth
would
result
in
a
divine
transformation
of
his
body,
elevating
him
to
an
even
higher
level
of
power.
At
a
command
from
Soterios,
his
acolytes
lowered
the
High
Priest
into
the
cold,
dark
sea.
Unfortunately,
his
Rebirth
did
not
go
as
planned
and
as
water
filled
his
lungs,
the
dying
High
Priest
made
one
last
plea
to
the
higher
powers.
Reborn
by
the
Immortals,
he
renamed
himself
Well,
the
Hydrosoul,
and
lives
only
to
do
their
bidding.
Speculation
on
the
Water
Mage
Possibly
a
recent
undertaking
of
Riot
after
a
post
in
the
TR
forums
requested
that
there
be
an
&quot;all
water
using
character&quot;
also
asking
if
Riot
had
the
technology
for
the
effects.
There
has
been
no
announcement
and
no
posts
on
TR
since
so
that
this
character
is
classed
as
a
rumor.

in

The
&quot;Ritual
of
Rebirth&quot;
mentioned
in
Well's
backstory
is
incredibly
similar
to
Damphair,
a
character
from
George
Martin's
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
book
series.
Damphair
worships
an
entity
called
the
Drowned
God
and
'baptizes'
others
by
holding
them
underwater
and
then
resuscitating
them
afterwards.
Trivia
The
ability
icon
for
Vortex
was
reused
for
the
previous
icon
of
the
Crest
of
Crushing
Wrath
,
which
is
obtained
from
killing
Ebonmaw
on
The
Twisted
Treeline
.
It
was
also
reused
as
the
Attack
Damage
buff
icon
for
Janna's
Eye
of
the
Storm
.
The
ability
icon
for
Typhoon
has
been
reused
for
the
Crest
of
Flowing
Water
buff,
which
was
obtained
from
killing
the
Ghast
on
The
Twisted
Treeline
.
