Example
Surge
was
a
'non-targeted'
Summoner
Spell
available
in
all
game
modes.
As
part
of
the
season
three
overhaul,
this
summoner
spell
was
removed.
Its
functionality
was
added
in-part
to
Guinsoo's
Rageblade
,
which
uses
Surge's
icon
while
in
effect.
Contents
[
show
]
Strategy
It
was
a
highly
efficient
tool
for
all
AP
characters
pushing
turrets
as,
unlike
towards
any
other
targets,
if
40%
of
your
AP
is
greater
than
your
AD
bonus
your
champion
is
going
to
add
that
amount
to
the
base
damage
of
the
autoattack
instead
of
the
bonus
attack
damage.
The
bonus
attack
speed
helps
significantly,
as
well.
If
used
prior
to
abilities
which
have
a
longer
duration
than
Surge
itself,
those
abilities
will
retain
the
enhanced
ability
power
from
surge
even
after
it
has
expired.
Some
examples
include
Heimerdinger's
H-28G
Evolution
Turret
,
Teemo's
Noxious
Trap
,
Maokai's
Sapling
Toss
,
etc.
Notes
The
spell
increases
the
size
of
the
character
model
of
your
champion.
This
spell
can
not
increase
your
attack
speed
over
the
set
cap
of
2.5.

damage
will
be
mitigated
by
Black
Shield
and
Lifeline
.
Spell
shields
will
block
the
ability
and
prevent
the
trap
from
affecting
nearby
units.
Additional
Information:
Turrets
will
reveal,
but
not
attack,
traps
within
their
sight
radius
Noxious
Trap's
damage
over
time
effect
does
not
stack.
Enemies
who
detonate
multiple
traps
will
only
have
the
duration
refreshed
per
trap
they
detonate.
Noxious
Trap's
damage
over
time
effect
counts
as
a
poison
for
the
purpose
of
Cassiopeia's
Twin
Fang
Noxious
Trap's
damage
is
determined
at
detonation,
not
at
the
time
of
being
placed
which
means
any
ability
power
Teemo
gains
or
loses
will
affect
all
active
shrooms.
