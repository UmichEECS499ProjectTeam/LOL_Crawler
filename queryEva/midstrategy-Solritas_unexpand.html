Ezreal
Champion
Background
Strategy
Skins
&amp;
Trivia
Skill
usage
Ezreal's
strength
as
a
marksman
comes
from
his
versatile
kit,
high
mixed
damage,
and
attack
speed
steroid
from
Rising
Spell
Force
.
His
Mystic
Shot
,
Essence
Flux
,
and
Arcane
Shift
have
decent
range
and
good
utility,
encouraging
a
caster
playstyle,
and
his
Trueshot
Barrage
can
deal
high
burst
damage
to
multiple
targets.
Ezreal
has
one
of
the
lowest
base
healths
at
Level
1.
Utilize
the
range
from
your
skills
to
keep
yourself
safe.
By
aiming
Mystic
Shot
in
brushes
and
watching
your
cooldowns
while
listening
for
Mystic
Shot's
hit
sound,
you
can
see
if
enemies
are
hiding
in
a
brush
.
Keep
an
eye
on
your
Rising
Spell
Force
stacks
and
whether
they
increase/refresh.
This
aspect
allows
you
to
check
brush
with
Ezreal's
other
abilities
as
well.
Ezreal
can
utilize
the
Spell
Weaving
and
Blade
Weaving
masteries
to
stack
up
a
fair
amount
of
extra
damage
with
successive
spells
and
auto
attacks
against
enemy
champions.
However,
players
must
be
more
aggressive
and
ensure
that
they
land
their
skills.
If
attacking
a
tower
with
an
ally,
you
can
use
Essence
Flux
on
them
to
boost
their
attack
speed.
Hitting
the
friendly
champion
will
proc
Rising
Spell
Force
,
granting
you
attack
speed
as
well.
In
the
lane,
Ezreal's
early
burst
damage
and
poke
is
very
high.
Combine
this
with
a
support
or
jungler's
crowd
control
to
get
some
kills.
Do
not
underestimate
Essence
Flux's
damage
when
building
Ability
Power
.
With
some
aim,
AP
Ezreal
can
easily
harass
and
burst
enemies
down
safely
behind
minions.
Remember
that
Arcane
Shift
can
be
used
to
jump
terrain
spots
and
walls
in
the
jungle.
It
is
your
best
escape
mechanism.
Be
careful
using
it
offensively
in
a
skirmish
as
people
will
know
to
focus
you
while
it's
on
cooldown.
Take
note
of
the
surrounding
area.
If
Ezreal
is
low
on
health
and
tries
to
Arcane
Shift
over
a
wall,
the
escape
attempt
may
hurt
you
if
the
homing
missile
targets
a
jungle
monster
and
pulls
aggro.
The
missile
will
track
the
closest
target
after
Ezreal
uses
Arcane
Shift
.
Keep
this
in
mind
when
using
the
skill
offensively
near
enemy
minions.
Use
Arcane
Shift
to
help
line
up
your
other
abilities,
but
avoid
using
it
in
situations
that
would
leave
you
vulnerable.
You
can
line
up
Trueshot
Barrage
to
hit
multiple
minion
waves
or
monsters.
Do
not
hesitate
to
use
Trueshot
Barrage
to
just
farm
a
creep
wave
or
defend
a
turret
.
By
spamming
Mystic
Shot
,
the
cooldown
for
Trueshot
Barrage
will
come
back
up
very
quickly.
With
maxed
cooldown
reduction
,
its
cooldown
can
end
up
as
low
as
30
seconds.
Trueshot
Barrage
can
be
used
at
the
beginning
of
a
team
fight
to
instantly
gain
5
stacks
of
Rising
Spell
Force
.
Trueshot
Barrage
takes
approximately
12
seconds,
from
the
start
of
casting
time,
to
reach
the
enemy
summoning
circle
from
your
own.
Ezreal
benefits
from
the
two
neutral
buffs
more
so
than
most
ADCs.
Crest
of
the
Ancient
Golem
allows
Ezreal
to
use
his
skills
with
impunity
and
Blessing
of
the
Lizard
Elder
allows
him
to
kite
with
Mystic
Shot
.
With
some
vision
control,
Trueshot
Barrage
can
be
used
to
steal
the
enemy's
own
buffs.
With
perfect
timing
and
ward
placement,
Trueshot
Barrage
can
be
also
used
to
steal
away
a
Dragon
kill
or
even
Baron
Nashor
.
Trueshot
Barrage
can
be
saved
for
teamfights
or
1v1
situations
to
finish
off
enemies
as
they
run
away.
Since
the
range
is
global
and
does
massive
amount
of
damage
you
can
kill
low
health
enemies
with
a
well-aimed
ultimate.
Never
forget
that
Trueshot
Barrage
is
global
and
you
may
be
able
to
snipe
a
enemy
champion
from
all
the
way
across
the
map
if
you
have
good
aim.
You
can
also
use
it
to
soften
up
a
enemy
that
you
are
aiming
to
fight.
Having
teammates
with
good
CC
like
Leona
or
Amumu
can
make
it
much
easier
to
land
your
skills
and
make
the
enemy
take
the
full
brunt
of
your
Trueshot
Barrage
.
If
you
decide
to
snipe
a
fleeing
enemy,
make
sure
they
don't
have
any
sort
of
heal,
shield,
or
invulnerability.
While
Trueshot
Barrage
has
high
base
damage,
the
falloff
could
be
the
deciding
factor
in
getting
a
kill;
to
get
the
most
out
of
it,
try
to
hit
your
target
without
it
hitting
minions.
Use
Trueshot
Barrage
when
the
enemy
has
no
vision
of
Ezreal
so
that
they
will
be
unable
to
warn
their
teammates.
Note
that
Trueshot
Barrage
can
be
seen
through
the
fog
of
war,
so
a
wary
opponent
can
watch
for
it
and
avoid
it
from
a
distance.
Trueshot
Barrage
has
a
channel
time
upfront
and
is
easily
dodged
by
skilled
players.
For
this
reason,
it
is
often
a
good
idea
to
use
it
to
hit
an
entire
team
immediately
after
the
battle
starts,
dealing
significant
total
damage
and
granting
multiple
stacks
of
Rising
Spell
Force
.
Trueshot
Barrage
is
especially
powerful
in
Dominion,
delaying
enemies'
attempts
to
capture
your
towers
and
buying
crucial
time.
Due
to
its
relatively
low
cooldown
in
conjunction
with
Mystic
Shot
,
use
it
wisely
and
use
it
often.
Smart
casting
will
give
you
a
faster
response
time,
allowing
you
to
hit
more
abilities.
Smart
casting
Arcane
Shift
can
help
you
dodge
a
lot
of
otherwise
deadly
situations.
Build
usage
Mystic
Shot
deals
physical
damage.
Stacking
up
on
armor
penetration
runes
greatly
increase
the
damage
this
skill
deals,
especially
in
the
lower
levels.
Ezreal
has
several
options
regarding
using
armor
penetration
and
armor
reduction
in
all
of
his
builds
(Mind
the
notes
regarding
armor
penetration
):
The
Brutalizer
is
a
good
early
item
for
an
attack
damage
or
hybrid
(
attack
damage
and
ability
power
)
build,
granting
attack
damage,
armor
penetration,
and
cooldown
reduction.
The
Black
Cleaver
can
be
used
as
an
all-around
item
complementing
well
into
mid
to
late-phase.
While
a
less
to
not-effective
option
for
ability
power,
its
strength
for
Mystic
Shot
and
improving
auto-attacks
with
attack
damage
and
armor
reduction
make
it
a
good
item
against
low
-
mid
armor
champions.
Last
Whisper
complements
Ezreal
for
Mystic
Shot
and
attack
damage.
While
less-useful
for
regular
auto-attack
than
The
Black
Cleaver
,
the
armor
penetration
is
the
strongest
against
mid-high
armor
stacking
champions,
it
is
an
amazing
item
against
tougher
enemies.
Its
low
cost
makes
it
an
affordable
purchase
in
the
early-phase.
However,
it's
not
exactly
suitable
for
ability
power
and/or
hybrid
builds
as
Youmuu's
Ghostblade
is.
You
can
play
Ezreal
either
as
a
ranged
physical
or
caster
damage
per
second
depending
on
how
you
build
him.
Physical
damage
per
second
plays
like
a
ranged
damage
per
second,
utilizing
autoattacks,
Mystic
Shot
and
Trueshot
Barrage
for
burst
damage,
and
other
abilities
for
utility
and
supplementary
damage.
Caster
damage
per
second
plays
like
an
area
of
effect
caster,
utilizing
Essence
Flux
and
Trueshot
Barrage
to
damage
multiple
targets
in
battles
while
using
Mystic
Shot
for
supplementary
damage
and
cooldown
reduction.
If
you
get
Wriggle's
Lantern
you
can
turn
Ezreal
into
a
very
fast
jungler
and
increase
his
farming
considerably.
Tear
of
the
Goddess
is
a
good
item
early
game
(upgrading
to
Manamune
or
Archangel's
Staff
later
on)
if
you
run
out
of
mana
too
quickly.
The
casting
of
Mystic
Shot
procs
Sheen's
damage
buff,
which
is
then
applied
when
the
shot
hits
the
target,
thus
increasing
its
damage.
If
you
miss
Mystic
Shot
,
auto
attack
the
enemy
once
before
casting
Mystic
Shot
again.
The
same
applies
for
using
other
abilities
before
casting
Mystic
Shot
,
as
not
using
the
Sheen
can
decrease
DPS
considerably.
Phage
/
Trinity
Force
improve
his
kiting
ability.
Alternatively,
Iceborn
Gauntlet
provides
an
area
slow
when
hitting
any
enemy
with
Mystic
Shot
,
great
for
pinning
down
or
separating
teams.
If
using
a
primarily
AP
build,
Lich
Bane
will
scale
better
than
Trinity
Force
or
Iceborn
Gauntlet
.
Guinsoo's
Rageblade
can
be
stacked
quickly
using
Mystic
Shot
.
On
cast,
it
procs
one
stack,
and
procs
a
second
stack
if
it
hits
the
target.
Mystic
Shot
cannot
critically
strike,
so
building
items
like
Infinity
Edge
would
be
less
effective
than
building
an
item
like
The
Bloodthirster
unless
you
are
unable
to
maintain
stacks.
When
building
AP,
Morellonomicon
and
Ionian
Boots
of
Lucidity
will
boost
your
damage
output
by
providing
35%
CDR,
75
AP,
and
12
MP5.
Depending
on
what
you
build,
Ezreal
can
choose
to
pick
up
an
Archangel's
Staff
,
Manamune
or
both.
Within
the
preparation
phase
of
Dominion
in
the
early
1:20
minutes,
Ezreal
can
start
collecting
Mana
with
Tear
of
the
Goddess
by
keeping
every
ability
on
Cooldown
.
This
can
serve
as
a
minor
improvement
for
the
early
phases.
While
the
bonus
Mana
pool
of
Archangel's
Staff
and
Manamune
are
the
same,
they
compliment
each
other
very
well.
Getting
both
requires
a
high
level
of
farm
though.
Nevertheless,
each
item
is
very
useful
if
quickly
farmed
and
can
be
a
fundamental
part
of
most
builds.
Mystic
Shot
can
trigger
Lich
Bane
's
passive,
making
it
a
core
item
on
any
AP
build
since
it
increases
Mystic
Shot
's
AP
ratio
from
.2
to
.95
(in
addition
to
an
extra
50
base
magic
damage)
and
a
spellsword
mastery
will
top
Mystic
Shot
to
a
1
to
1
AP
ratio.
With
Nashor's
Tooth
your
Mystic
Shot
can
be
even
better
-
up
to
1.15
AP
ratio.
Nashor's
Tooth
is
perfect
for
both
AD
or
AP
Ezreal
as
it
provides
Attack
Speed
,
Cooldown
Reduction
to
continuously
spam
Mystic
Shot
and
Ability
Power
to
increase
all
Ezreal's
ability
damage,
and
all
for
a
relatively
low
cost.
Quicksilver
Sash
,
Mercurial
Scimitar
,
or
Cleanse
are
useful
for
Ezreal
,
allowing
him
to
escape
enemy
crowd
control
effects
and
reposition
in
teamfights.

Countering
Ezreal
is
fairly
squishy
at
early
game.
Harassing
him
early
will
hinder
his
gold
and
experience
gain.
Three
of
his
spells
deal
magic
damage.
Buying
a
Negatron
Cloak
or
Mercury's
Treads
early
will
help
you
mitigate
his
damage
if
he
builds
towards
those
spells.
Ezreal's
Trueshot
Barrage
has
a
global
range.
Take
care
when
recalling
when
your
health
is
low.
The
projectile
can
be
seen
through
fog,
watching
the
map
while
recalling
can
help
you
notice
it
soon
enough
to
move
out
of
the
way.
Although
Trueshot
Barrage
is
a
channeled
ability,
you
cannot
stop
the
channel
with
hard
CC.
The
only
way
to
prevent
him
from
ulting
mid-cast
is
by
killing
him.
All
of
Ezreal's
abilities
are
skill
shots
.
Buying
movement
speed
items
will
make
it
easier
to
evade
his
spells.
When
dueling
an
Ezreal
as
Ezreal
,
try
using
Arcane
Shift
to
dodge
their
first
Mystic
Shot
.
Immediately,
you
are
in
a
good
place
to
chase
them,
have
dealt
more
damage,
built
a
stack
on
Rising
Spell
Force
,
and
have
a
cooldown
advantage.
If
you
can
dodge
Mystic
Shot
while
they
are
casting
Essence
Flux
,
you
will
have
an
even
greater
advantage.
For
this
reason,
be
careful
using
Arcane
Shift
offensively
against
another
Ezreal
.
Ezreal
cannot
trade
fairly
during
close
combat
and
relies
heavily
on
poking.
Having
a
champ
that
can
dash
or
blink
towards
him
(ie
Xin
Zhao
,
Diana
,
Irelia
)
would
cost
Ezreal
his
blink
to
run
away
from
the
team
fight
and
be
isolated
from
the
defending
allies
causing
his
death.
Pure
AP
Ezreal
suffers
from
a
weak
early
game;
his
burst
is
very
mana-intensive,
he
loses
his
only
non-flash
escape-skill
when
using
Arcane
Shift
offensively,
he
cannot
reliably
push
a
lane
and
he
lacks
any
kind
of
crowd
control
effects.
In
exchange,
he
becomes
a
very
high
damage
dealer
in
the
mid
and
lategame
due
to
his
high
AP-scalings
and
massive
AoE-damage.
In
this
case,
it
is
even
more
effective
to
dodge
his
skillshots
by
moving
erratically.
In
teamfights,
try
to
spread
out
so
he
cannot
hit
the
whole
team
with
his
Trueshot
Barrage
+
Essence
Flux
-combo.

Mirror
Image's
clone
acts
like
a
pet.
It
will
take
commands
similarly
to
Annie's
Summon:
Tibbers
.
It
is
wise
to
manually
control
it
for
the
means
of
confusing
the
opponent,
as
a
clone
heading
in
a
nonsensical
direction
after
being
summoned
clearly
betrays
the
real
LeBlanc
to
the
enemy.
Remember
to
use
ALT+RIGHT-CLICK
to
move
your
Mirror
Image's
clone.
Mirror
Image's
clone
is
a
champion
type
unit
and
therefore
can
also
be
hit
by
abilities
only
able
to
target
champions
such
as
Caitlyn's
Ace
in
the
Hole
.
Take
advantage
of
this
by
trying
to
encourage
your
enemies
to
use
their
powerful
champion
targeting
ultimates
on
your
clone
by
putting
yourself
out
of
sight
and
controlling
your
clone
like
she
were
the
original.
Keep
in
mind
that
your
clone's
auto-attacks
deal
no
damage
which
can
give
her
away
if
an
enemy
notices
this.
Distortion
provides
LeBlanc
with
a
deceptively
large
radius
of
threat.
Sigil
of
Silence
is
your
main
harassment
tool,
with
good
range
and
damage.
Distortion
is
an
effective
method
of
harassment,
as
re-casting
the
spell
will
cause
you
to
flash
back
to
your
casting
position,
giving
an
opportunity
to
deal
damage
with
minimal
risk
of
taking
significant
damage.
Combining
Sigil
of
Silence
and
Distortion
allows
you
to
deal
Sigil
of
Silence
's
proc
damage
as
well
as
silence
the
enemy
for
a
safe
retreat.
If
you
are
being
chased,
throw
Ethereal
Chains
on
the
pursuer
for
the
slow
and
potential
snare.
The
second
damaging
part
of
Ethereal
Chains
can
also
trigger
the
silence
from
Sigil
of
Silence
.
When
you
end
up
in
a
team
fight,
you
should
consider
utility
of
your
spells
over
damage,
and
consider
using
Ethereal
Chains
as
your
Mimic
spell
for
a
double
slow
and
longer
snare.
A
quick
way
to
cast
any
of
LeBlanc's
spells
is
to
smart-cast
them,
either
by
remapping
smart-cast
spells
to
Q
/
W
/
E
/
R
or
holding
shift
and
then
hitting
Q
/
W
/
E
/
R.
When
combined
with
the
combo
above
you
could
potentially
drop
an
enemy
carry
in
one
burst
before
they
have
time
to
react.
Ability
Combos
Activating
Sigil
of
Silence's
silence
mark
with
Ethereal
Chains
synergizes
perfectly
with
its
delayed
snare,
preventing
the
target
from
using
Flash
or
other
escape
mechanisms
for
more
than
3
seconds.
This
should
allow
yourself
or
your
team
to
secure
kills.
Chaining
Sigil
of
Silence
with
Mimic
can
provide
good
harassment
and
long
silence
periods
early-mid
game
and
can
shut
down
troublesome
casters
later
on.
By
selecting
a
target
to
cast
Sigil
of
Silence
on
while
out
of
range,
you
can
use
Distortion
to
close
the
gap,
and
then
use
it
again
to
return
to
safety.
Doing
this
can
extend
the
range
at
which
you
can
safely
harass
and
ward
enemy
champions
from
gold
or
experience.
Build
usage
While
it
may
seem
unintuitive,
Athene's
Unholy
Grail
is
actually
one
of
the
best
core
items
for
LeBlanc.
It
affords
her
some
cheap
magic
resist
to
increase
her
durability
in
lane,
virtually
eliminates
her
mana
problems,
and
most
importantly
it
provides
her
a
large
bonus
to
cooldown
reduction,
which,
because
of
her
high
base
damage,
drastically
increases
her
overall
damage.
Mejai's
Soulstealer
can
be
especially
powerful,
particularly
if
mid-laning.
Be
warned
that
due
to
her
already
snowbally
nature,
getting
killed
while
using
this
item
may
cause
her
to
fall
even
earlier
in
the
game
than
necessary.
It
is
worth
noting
that
getting
this
item
will
likely
make
the
enemy
team
redouble
their
efforts
to
shut
LeBlanc
down.
Given
that
she
is
already
a
priority
target
early
particularly
if
she
does
well,
getting
this
will
make
you
even
more
of
an
early-game
target
while
delaying
your
build
for
an
item
that
may
not
even
reach
gold
efficiency
if
you
are
focused
down.
Deathfire
Grasp
can
be
very
powerful
for
LeBlanc
as
it
covers
AP
and
an
additional
spell
in
her
combo
with
its
Active,
which
will
make
her
more
of
a
threat
in
the
later
stages
of
a
game.
Haunting
Guise
can
be
a
good
early
game
choice
for
LeBlanc
,
as
it
increases
durability
and
damage,
while
also
negating
early
game
Magic
Resistance.
It
can
also
replace
Sorcerer's
Shoes
in
many
builds,
allowing
the
use
of
other
boots
without
sacrificing
Magic
Penetration.
Two
Doran's
Ring
s
during
early
game
provides
cheap
and
highly
effective
stats.

Countering
Investing
in
an
early
Negatron
Cloak
for
magic
resistance
will
significantly
reduce
her
burst
damage.
Later
in
the
game,
you
can
build
it
into
a
Banshee's
Veil
and
disrupt
her
combo.
Otherwise,
if
you
are
playing
a
squishy
mage
or
AD
carry,
she
will
be
able
to
burst
you
down
even
late
game
due
to
good
scaling.
Do
NOT
neglect
MR.
LeBlanc
relies
heavily
on
spell
combos,
especially
with
her
Sigil
of
Silence
and
its
mimic.
Try
to
interrupt
her
spell
combo
in
the
middle
of
Sigil
of
Silence
,
as
this
will
often
force
her
back
to
wait
for
cooldown.
This
makes
Banshee's
Veil
particularly
effective
against
her
as
she
has
to
land
one
of
her
non-targeted
abilities
before
going
full
combo.
Be
sure
not
to
use
a
champion
who
relies
on
skillshots
or
delayed
AoE
damage
to
fight
her,
her
quadruple
moves
(with
both
Distortion
s)
can
make
her
untouchable
by
champions
such
as
Lux,
Xerath,
Diana,
Ziggs
or
Zyra.
Try
to
scare
LeBlanc
a
bit
to
force
her
to
use
her
dashes
prior
to
a
gank
,
as
the
long
cooldown
will
make
her
an
easy
target.
Mirror

's
clone
does
not
carry
buffs-
use
this
to
identify
the
real
LeBlanc.
Always
wait
for
her
passive
to
trigger
before
targeting
her
with
an
ultimate
like
Garen's
Demacian
Justice
because
otherwise
she
will
most
likely
get
away
with
Distortion
.
LeBlanc
is
extremely
squishy
so
she
is
very
vulnerable
to
hard
cc
and
focus.
Taking
her
out
of
the
fight
early
prevents
her
from
being
able
to
burst
down
a
carry.
Mirror
Image
's
stealth
does
not
break
the
auto
attacking
AI's
lock
on
her;
allowing
the
autoattacking
AI
to
continue
without
interruption
can
finish
her
off.
LeBlanc
is
notorious
for
being
able
to
burst
down
AP
mid
laners.
However,
because
she
specializes
on
bursting
one
target,
having
your
jungler
gank
during
her
dives
will
cripple
her
aggression
significantly
and
cause
her
to
fall
off
prematurely.
Warding
brushes
will
make
it
harder
for
LeBlanc
to
juke
using
Distortion
.
LeBlanc
has
poor
farming
capabilities;
if
you're
unable
to
make
trades
safely,
then
simply
clear
minion
waves
quickly
to
force
her
back.

Shyvana
Champion
Background
Strategy
Skins
&amp;
Trivia
Skill
Usage
Shyvana's
strength
comes
from
her
innate
durability
from
Dragonborn
and
her
high
mixed
damage
output,
AoE,
and
utility
from
Burnout
and
Dragon's
Descent
,
along
with
her
ability
to
duel
effectively
with
Flame
Breath
and
Twin
Bite
.
However,
she
lacks
hard
CC
and
is
prone
to
being
kited.
With
good
positioning
and
timing,
Twin
Bite
can
massively
extend
the
duration
of
Dragon's
Descent
.
By
hitting
three
targets,
it
generates
enough
fury
to
stay
in
dragon
form
for
another
two
seconds.
Twin
Bite
is
a
great
turret
pushing
tool,
as
it
allows
you
roughly
three
auto-attacks
worth
of
damage
in
the
time
space
of
~0.8.
(taking
into
account
attack
animation
time
and
casting
time)
Use
Burnout
to
chase
down
or
flee
from
enemies,
as
it
grants
bonus
movement
speed
.
Burnout
provides
the
largest
bonus
movement
speed
at
the
start
of
the
ability.
Activating
it
gives
a
quick
burst
of
speed
that
can
be
used
to
juke
skillshots
and
enemies.
Dragon's
Descent
is
an
excellent
peeling
ability,
if
you
see
a
key
member
of
your
team
(an
ADC
or
APC)
starting
to
get
focused,
use
the
dash
the
knock
the
enemies
off
while
giving
your
ally
enough
distance
to
continue
attacking.
With
good
positioning,
you
can
use
the
ability
to
push
enemies
away
from
your
allies
while
diving
onto
their
backline
to
disrupt
them.
Casting
Burnout
followed
by
Dragon's
Descent
will
lead
to
a
flaming
trail
from
where
you
started
Dragon's
Descent
.
Dragon's
Descent
can
be
used
to
chase
in
or
escape
from
any
situation.
Take
note
that
stuns,
silences,
snares,
knock-ups
and
knockback
effects
can
hit
and
stop
Shyvana
mid-flight.
Beware
of
your
enemies'
capabilities
to
do
these.
Dragon's
Descent
is
one
of
the
longest
dashes
in-game,
as
such
it
allows
going
over
large
walls
and
otherwise
impassable
terrain.
Since
patch
3.9,
Flame
Breath
passes
through
units.
If
you
find
yourself
as
a
laner
(most
likely
top)
putting
points
in
this
ability
gives
you
a
good
harassment
tool
and
can
be
used
to
farm
easily.
It
may
be
worth
maxing
if
you
are
against
a
ranged
opponent
as
Shyvana
has
no
other
ranged
abilities.
To
perform
a
quick
harass,
hit
your
opponent
with
Flame
Breath
and
run
into
them
with
Burnout
,
following
with
a
Twin
Bite
to
proc
the
mark
twice,
putting
out
good
damage
and
extending
Burnout
.
You
can
then
use
the
prolonged
speed
boost
granted
by
Burnout
to
escape
just
as
you
entered.
When
using
Dragon's
Descent
,
try
to
position
yourself
to
be
able
to
hit
as
many
targets
as
you
can
with
your
AoE
abilities.
Attacking
turrets
,
inhibitors
or
the
nexus
does
not
trigger
the
cooldown
reduction
for
Twin
Bite
.
It
does,
however,
reset
her
auto-attack
timer,
build
fury
and
extend
the
duration
of
Burnout
.
While
both
hits
triggered
from
Twin
Bite
deal
on-hit
effects
,
only
the
first
hit
is
able
to
deal
a
critical
strike
.
The
second
hit
only
deals
a
percentage
of
Shyvana's
attack
damage
as
damage.
Shyvana's
kit
allow
her
to
do
large
amount
of
damage
over
time
at
close-range,
but
it
doesn't
provide
her
with
burst
capabilities.
Failure
to
combine
or
land
Shyvana's
abilities
together
to
effectively
damage
a
target
will
create
an
opening
for
a
period
of
time
that
your
opponents
can
take
advantage
of,
so
be
aware
of
your
enemies'
potential
methods
to
disengage
from
you.
Build
Usages
Shyvana
lacks
crowd
control
aside
from
the
knockback
from
Dragon's
Descent
,
which
tends
to
be
unwieldy
and
dubious
in
effectiveness
in
many
cases.
Movement
speed
slowing
items
are
an
effective
source
of
CC
.
Both
Trinity
Force
and
Frozen
Mallet
are
very
powerful
on
Shyvana
,
but
buying
both
is
not
recommended.
Trinity
Force
gives
superior
late-game
damage
and
Frozen
Mallet
is
the
tried-and-true
choice
for
utility
and
tankiness.
On-hit
effect
and
attack
speed
items
have
substantial
synergy
with
Shyvana's
skillset.
They
will
increase
fury
generation,
lower
the
cooldown
on
Twin
Bite
,
proc
the
on-hit
effect
from
Flame
Breath
more
often,
and
increase
her
overall
damage
output
significantly.
The
attack
speed
and
on-hit
damage-effect
of
Wit's
End
synergizes
well
with
Shyvana
,
who
can
also
quickly
accumulate
the
item's
stacks.
Wriggle's
Lantern
and
Wit's
End
offer
an
excellent
combination
of
sustain,
damage
and
durability
from
both
physical
and
magical
damage
for
Shyvana
.
Sunfire
Cape
is
an
excellent
item
for
Shyvana
in
the
mid-game,
combining
a
generally
effective
chunk
of
durability
stats
to
survive
combat
with
a
good
amount
of
free
magic
damage
to
stack
with
Burnout
.
Items
that
grant
attack
speed
and
cooldown
reduction
are
great
offensive
items
for
Shyvana's
abilities,
especially
Twin
Bite
and
Dragon's
Descent
.
Although
Zeke's
Herald
is
more
of
a
support
item,
it
offers
CDR
,
attack
damage
,
health
,
life
steal
and
an
aura
.
Youmuu's
Ghostblade
is
an
excellent
item
for
damage
purposes
on
Shyvana
.
Its
active-effect's
attack
speed
and
movement
speed
help
Shyvana
utilize
her
passive
effects
and
chase,
provides
large
amount
CDR
and
the
armor
penetration
.
Nashor's
Tooth
is
an
effective
item
for
her,
offering
a
very
cost
effective
mix
of
attack
speed
and
CDR
that
it
grants
a
good
deal
of
ability
power
that
scales
well
with
her
Flame
Breath
and
Dragon's
Descent
.
Zephyr
is
great
on
Shyvana
as
it
gives
her
most
of
the
stats
she
needs:
attack
speed
,
CDR
,
attack
damage
,
and
movement
speed
.
Zephyr
also
gives
Shyvana
tenacity
which
allows
her
to
replace
Mercury's
Treads
with
other
boots
While
it
may
seem
odd,
Abyssal
Scepter
will
make
her
highly
resilient
to
magical
burst,
and
vastly
boost
the
damage
Dragon's
Descent
and
Flame
Breath
because
they
scale
with
AP,
but
also
of
Burnout
as
it
deals
magical
damage
and
the
scepter
aura
reduces
MR
Randuin's
Omen
is
a
great
defensive
item
for
Shyvana
.
Its
AoE
active
is
very
useful
due
to
Shyvana
having
a
fairly
minimal
method
for
crowd
control
and
her
kit's
pletheora
of
area
of
effect
abilities
prefers
when
enemies
that
are
close
together
to
stay
that
way
as
long
as
possible.
Aegis
of
the
Legion
synergizes
with
Shyvana's
Dragon's
Descent
passive,
granting
you
a
lot
of
survivability
at
a
small
cost
in
early
game.
Bilgewater
Cutlass
is
a
great
mid
game
item
as
it
helps
Shyvana's
sustainability
along
with
the
unique
effect
that
allows
her
to
stick
to
her
target.
It
can
also
be
built
into
Blade
of
the
Ruined
King
,
which
synergizes
well
with
Burnout
and
Flame
Breath
considering
the
passive
and
active,
and
allows
her
to
maintain
a
strong
late
game
and
be
a
formidable
duelist.
Tiamat
and
its
upgrade,
Ravenous
Hydra
,
can
be
great
cost
effective
items
for
Shyvana
,
offering
attack
damage,
sustain
with
health
regen
and
life
steal
along
with
the
active
and
passive
effect,
which
synergizes
with
Shyvana's
Twin
Bite
,
procing
twice
on
a
single
target.
Tiamat
and
Ravenous
Hydra
share
a
unique
passive
Cleave
,
so
stacking
Tiamat
/
Ravenous
Hydra
doesn't
increase
the
splash
damage.
Twin
Bite
during
Dragon's
Descent
will
only
proc
the
passive
twice
on
the
primary
target
due
to
an
intern
timer
preventing
it
from
affecting
multiple
targets
in
one
attack.
Jungling
Shyvana
is
one
of
the
fastest
junglers,
having
great
clear
speed
and
mobility,
allowing
her
to
counter
jungling
exceptionally
well.
However,
her
lack
of
CC
diminishes
her
early
game
presence
and
is
more
focused
on
denying
the
enemy
jungler.
Consider
picking
up
a
Wriggle's
Lantern
for
extended
survivability
and
a
Frozen
Mallet
to
make
your
ganks
more
effective.

Countering
While
Shyvana
is
auto-attack
reliant
and
is
likely
to
build
attack
damage
items,
Shyvana's
Burnout
deals
magic
damage
,
which
scales
off
bonus
attack
damage
,
and
the
on-hit
effect
of
Flame
Breath
deals
magic
damage
based
off
the
target's
maximum
health
-
this
gives
Shyvana
high
mixed
damage
that
is
difficult
to
itemize
against.
Overall,
it
is
better
to
build
magic
resistance
over
health
and
armor
to
counteract
her
kit's
magic
damage
,
though
attack
speed
slowing
items
such
as
Frozen
Heart
and
Randuin's
Omen
may
help
to
lower
her
damage
output
considerably.
If
you
notice
Shyvana
using
her
Dragon's
Descent
,
move
away
from
the
spell
path
to
avoid
it
damaging
you
-
at
full
range,
it
will
take
her
1.3
seconds
to
reach
you
so
you
usually
can
hope
to
dodge
it
from
a
long
distance.
If
you
have
stun,
silence,
snare,
knock-back
or
knock-up
abilities,
use
them
quickly
on
Shyvana
when
she
casts
Dragon's
Descent
to
stop
her
mid-flight.
Shyvana
has
a
lot
of
potential
for
AoE
damage
while
using
Dragon's
Descent
.
However,
Twin
Bite
and
Flame
Breath
strike
in
front
of
her,
so
splitting
apart
to
make
Shyvana
unable
to
face
as
much
of
your
team
at
once
will
reduce
the
effectiveness
of
Twin
Bite
and
Flame
Breath
.
Take
note
if
Shyvana's
fury
bar
is
full
while
you
are
attempting
to
kill
her.
The
long
range
of
Dragon's
Descent
can
easily
allow
her
to
go
over
walls
even
while
a
fair
distance
away
from
them,
so
avoid
wasting
abilities
with
significant
cooldowns
and
costs
on
her.
Dragon's
Descent
is
not
limited
by
cooldown
-
quickly
gaining
fury
allows
her
ultimate
to
be
ready
long
before
yours
if
you
misuse
it.
Dragon's
Descent
requires
fury
,
which
is
quickly
gained
by
Shyvana
auto-attacking.
This
time
period
is
a
good
opportunity
to
harass
her
from
range
and
delay
her
ultimate.
Shyvana
shines
in
an
extended
close-combat
fight
over
time.
Use
champions
with
many
options
to
disengage
and
do
your
best
to
avoid
such
a
fight
against
her.
Shyvana
has
no
natural
ways
to
keep
you
in
place
for
her
to
auto-attack
you.
After
using
Dragon's
Descent
,
she
has
little
ability
to
catch
up
if
crowd-controlled
out
of
melee-range.
Using
crowd-control
effects
to
hinder
her
movement
during
Burnout
can
also
stop
her
from
getting
the
ability
to
its
maximum
duration
or
damage.
Burnout
provides
a
very
large
amount
of
bonus
movement
speed
at
the
beginning
of
the
ability,
which
decreases
a
bit
in
effectiveness
over
time.
Try
to
avoid
using
skillshots
against
Shyvana
until
after
she
casts
Burnout
,
as
the
movement
speed
boost,
especially
at
the
ability's
initial
use,
can
allow
her
to
easily
dodge
them.
Shyvana
tends
to
jungle
and
normally,
Shyvana's
jungle
route
starts
at
red.
Thus,
considering
stealing
her
blue
is
a
likely
safe
method
to
take
experience
away
her
early
jungle
and
to
prevent
any
enemies
from
having
it.
In
her
dragon
form,
Shyvana
is
more
powerful
than
during
her
human
form.
Her
passive
during
her
ultimate
is
doubled,
therefore
it
is
recommended
to
buy
armor
penetration
or
spell
penetration
items.
Keep
your
allies
spread
to
avoid
her
Twin
Bite
and
Flame
Breath
as
the
spells
are
turned
into
AoE
spells.
Beware
overextending
into
tense
situations
to
chase
her
in
her
dragon
form.
Burnout
increases
her
movement
speed
to
make
catching
her
difficult
and
leaves
a
fiery
trail
that
can
deal
significant
damage
if
you
do
not
avoid
it.
Following
the
burning
trail
allows
you
to
find
her
easily,
but
you
also
take
DoT
-
if
you
and
Shyvana
are
both
fairly
weakened,
underestimating
the
DoT
can
firmly
put
the
tide
in
her
favor.
Shyvana
lacks
any
gap
hard
gap
closers
across
from
her
ultimate,
Dragon's
Descent
and
she
is
highly
dependent
on
her
movement
speed
with
Burnout
to
get
into
range
into
the
enemy.
As
such,
ranged
top
laners
with
good
kiting
mechanics
such
as
Teemo
,
Kennen
,
Jayce
,
Nidalee
,
Ryze
,
Lulu
,
and
Kayle
can
easily
zone
Shyvana
out
and
can
harass
and
farm
safely
in
a
distance.
Keep
in
note
that
Shyvana
is
one
of
the
few
bruisers
that
do
not
use
mana
as
a
resource
and
can
easily
build
life
steal
items
such
as
Ravenous
Hydra
,
Blade
of
the
Ruined
King
,
and
The
Bloodthirster
to
sustain
herself
in
lane
longer,
so
build
accordingly
to
counter
her.

Trivia
Skill
usage
Draw
a
Bead
becomes
extremely
powerful
later
in
the
game,
allowing
Tristana
to
hit
enemies
from
afar.
Tristana
can
outrange
any
other
ranged
carry
at
level
13,
making
her
a
very
strong
pick
if
your
team
lacks
hard
CC
and
already
has
a
wide
array
of
slows.
Kog'Maw's
Bio-Arcane
Barrage
out-ranges
Draw
a
Bead
by
7
range
at
level
18.
Leveling
Rapid
Fire
early
on
is
unadvisable,
since
Tristana's
low
base
Attack
Damage
early
on
the
game
doesn't
make
much
use
of
the
AS
steroid.
Wait
until
you
buy
some
AD
items
such
as
B.
F.
Sword
.
Rapid
Fire
is
applied
to
the
next
autoattack's
wait
period
-
cast
it
right
before
an
autoattack
to
squeeze
as
much
as
you
can
from
the
duration.
Since
that
Rocket
Jump
resets
on
kills
or
assists
you
may
use
it
to
secure
a
kill,
and
allows
Tristana
to
either
Rocket
Jump
out
of
a
deadly
situation
after
she
has
gotten
a
kill
or
jump
again
to
set
up
another.
The
cost
of
Rocket
Jump
is
high
compared
to
her
mana
pool.
Pay
attention
that
you
have
enough
mana
before
jumping
in.
Tristana
can
use
abilities
while
in
the
air
from
Rocket
Jump
.
This
allows
a
very
strong,
fast
combo
if
you
play
her
as
an
AP
caster.
Using
Rocket
Jump
to
leap
over
an
enemy
and
then
using
Buster
Shot
to
send
them
flying
back
to
your
allies
or
an
allied
turret
can
be
very
effective,
but
be
careful
about
using
the
strategy
in
large
team
fights.
Rocket
Jump
can
also
be
used
defensively,
especially
for
jumping
out
of
AoE
abilities
such
as
Event
Horizon
or
Absolute
Zero
,
as
well
as
in
and
out
of
the
base
walls
around
the
Nexus
on
Summoner's
Rift
and
Twisted
Treeline
.
Be
careful
when
using
Rocket
Jump
as
it
is
considered
a
&quot;dash&quot;,
even
though
it
is
visually
a
&quot;jump&quot;.
This
means
that
if
you
jump
over
a
trap
(like
Yordle
Snap
Trap
)
you
will
activate
the
trap
and
its
effects.
Use
Explosive
Shot
on
enemy
champions
who
rely
on
regeneration
or
healing.
This
severely
drops
their
chances
of
survival,
as
it
reduces
their
regeneration/healing
by
half.
The
passive
of
Explosive
Shot
is
surprisingly
useful
in
farming
-
if
there
are
a
lot
of
minions
in
a
relatively
confined
area,
killing
one
could
burst
the
remaining
minions
and
gain
a
lot
of
gold
in
a
relatively
short
time,
without
the
use
of
abilities.
Combine
this
with
Rapid
Fire
and
she
can
easily
farm
up
and
clear
minion
waves
with
an
ease.
Be
careful
though,
this
will
push
the
lane
hard
which
leaves
her
open
to
ganks.
In
the
early
game,
Explosive
Shot
is
your
best
method
of
harassing
enemies,
as
your
autoattacks
are
weak
early
on
and
Rocket
Jump
leaves
you
vulnerable
at
melee
range.
Explosive
Shot
Resets
your
auto
attack
animation,
so
you
can
add
an
attack
before
and
after
shooting
Explosive
Shot
for
extra
damage.
Using
a
Buster
Shot
to
move
a
disruptive
caster
such
as
Ryze
or
Veigar
away
can
give
you
a
strong
advantage
in
team
fights
or
ganks.
Buster
Shot
will
also
interrupt
channeled
abilities
such
as
Karthus's
Requiem
,
Katarina's
Death
Lotus
,
or
Nunu's
Absolute
Zero
.
Buster
Shot
can
be
used
to
push
various
groups
of
close
enemies
tightly
packed
together.
Use
this
to
help
distance
enemies
from
yourself
when
fleeing.
It
can
even
knock
them
through
small
walls.
Tristana
is
best
placed
in
the
back
of
a
group
or
flanking
enemies
from
the
side.
Using
Rocket
Jump
to
escape
and
using
Buster
Shot
while
in
mid-air
can
make
sure
that
you
escape.
Using
Buster
Shot
On
any
character
trying
to
get
near
you,
allows
you
to
attack
them
from
longer
range
with
your
passive,
giving
you
sometimes
an
easy
kill
on
a
melee
DPS
champion.
If
timed
correctly,
Buster
Shot
can
be
used
to
counter
a
champion
that
is
dashing
to
Tristana
.
Build
usage
Tristana's
low
base
movement
makes
it
difficult
for
her
to
chase
enemies
or
to
escape.
This
is
especially
prominent
at
low
levels.
Getting
Boots
of
Speed
quickly
is
highly
beneficial.
Be
sure
to
watch
the
enemy
builds
and
pick
the
proper
boot
upgrade.
While
Phage
may
seem
to
be
a
good
item
to
buy
due
to
the
on-hit
effect
that
grants
movement
speed
to
Tristana
;
the
main
item
that
it
builds
into,
Trinity
Force
,
is
not
a
cost
effective
item
since
most
of
Tristana
's
damage
comes
from
basic
attacks
and
lacks
any
low
cooldown
abilities
to
constantly
proc
the
Sheen
's
passive.
In
addition,
the
stats
that
Trinity
Force
grants
to
Tristana
is
very
mediocre
at
best.
Because
of
this,
if
Tristana
needs
movement
speed,
it's
better
to
build
flat
attack
speed
items
that
grants
movement
speed
such
as
Phantom
Dancer
,
Statikk
Shiv
,
and
Zephyr
instead.
Be
careful
when
picking
Tristana
,
as
an
enemy's
blind
can
render
you
fairly
useless.
A
Quicksilver
Sash
can
be
used
to
counter
blinding
champions
such
as
Teemo
and
to
escape
other
hard
CC's.
Quicksilver
Sash
can
later
be
upgraded
into
Mercurial
Scimitar
,
which
provides
more
attack
damage
for
Tristana
.
Consider
building
Blade
of
the
Ruined
King
if
you
are
dealing
with
tanks
building
a
lot
of
high
health
items
or
benefits
from
building
high
health
items
like
Shen
and
Dr.
Mundo
.
Blade
of
the
Ruined
King
also
mitigates
some
of
her
weak-mid
game
thanks
to
the
passive
that
procs
with
her
auto-attacks
and
the
active
adding
additional
self-peeling
power
with
her
Buster
Shot
and
Rocket
Jump
.
Tristana's
high
attack
speed
steroid
and
powerful
attack
range
make
Infinity
Edge
especially
cost
efficient
on
her.
AP
Tristana
Due
to
her
high
AP
ratios
on
her
abilites,
Tristana
can
also
be
built
AP
if
your
team
requires
an
AP
nuker
as
well
as
an
AP
support
due
to
being
ranged
with
decent
crowd
control
capabilities.
Similar
to
the
original
AP
Master
Yi
,
Tristana
loses
her
DPS
potential
with
a
full-AP
build,
but
gains
newfound
burst
damage
to
whittle
down
targets
and
in
teamfights,
she
can
potentially
one-shot
them.
However,
this
type
of
build
offers
very
risky
gameplay,
as
Tristana
must
make
sure
to
play
safe
due
to
lack
of
strong-auto
attacks,
as
well
as
her
general
squishiness.
Deathfire
Grasp
greatly
improves
Tristana's
single-target
burst.
Lich
Bane
is
also
great
item
for
her
AP
build,
as
you
can
get
in
extra
proc
from
your
Rapid
Fire
.
Morellonomicon
is
another
great
early
game
item
for
Tristana
as
it
offers
Grievous
Wounds
to
all
of
her
AP
ratio
abilities
and
not
just
for
her
Explosive
Shot
,
and
the
cooldown
reduction
and
mana
regeneration
also
helps.
Rushing
Rabadon's
Deathcap
and/or
Wooglet's
Witchcap
can
cause
Tristana
to
dominate
early
game
if
possible,
due
to
her
high
AP
ratios.
Like
with
Lich
Bane
,
Nashor's
Tooth
in
combo
with
it
can
not
only
provide
cooldown
reduction
and
attack
speed
for
Tristana
to
retain
DPS,
but
due
to
the
procs
scaling
off
her
AP,
it
can
make
up
for
her
lost
ADC
style.

Countering
Tristana
is
an
AD-carry
with
massive
base
damage
on
3
of
her
spells
giving
her
a
very
powerful
early
game.
However
when
built
AD
she
does
not
have
scaling
for
her
burst
abilities
due
to
the
lack
of
ability
power,
meaning
her
mid-game
is
a
little
weak.
Abuse
this,
since
Tristana
late
game
is
one
of
the
closest
to
unstoppable
in
the
entire
league
due
to
massive
range,
AS-boost
and
the
peeling
power
of
Rocket
Jump
and
her
ultimate.
DO
NOT
underestimate
her
though,
as
even
with
a
&quot;weak&quot;
mid-game,
she
can
and
does
have
decent
burst
when
done
right,
and
any
decent
Tristana
player
will
be
working
to
compensate
for
this.
Tristana
has
a
huge
range
when
she
reaches
level
18
because
of
her
Draw
a
Bead
;
avoid
getting
kited.
Early
game,
her
range
is
fairly
short;
use
it
to
your
advantage
to
harass
her
and
deny
her
farm.
Tristana
has
a
lot
of
burst
damage
from
her
abilities
early
on
-
buying
early
defenses
along
with
having
a
way
to
escape
her/peel
her
from
you
can
hinder
her
from
zoning
or
killing
you
at
the
early
game.
A
target
surviving
her
abilities
being
cast
on
them
leaves
her
vulnerable
to
counter-attacks
if
they
have
the
health
or
sustain
to
stick
around.
Standing
near
the
brush
can
allow
you
to
duck
into
it
after
she
uses
Rocket
Jump
on
you,
avoiding
a
good
follow-up
from
the
rest
of
her
abilities.
As
Rocket
Jump
is
the
lynch-pin
to
her
combo,
she
can
then
be
attacked
from
range
after
escaping
her
without
fear
of
reprisal
while
it
is
on
cooldown.
Tristana
has
no
long-range
poke
abilities
-
having
a
champion
that
can
do
this
can
damage
her
freely.
As
the
range
of
Rocket
Jump
is
very
long,
however,
being
a
champion
that
can
escape
or
having
a
partner
that
can
peel
that
is
likely
also
a
requirement.
Tristana
is
vulnerable
to
being
hit
by
skillshots
during
the
animation
of
Rocket
Jump
(being
essentially
a
very
slow
dash)
and
hard
crowd
control
can
stop
the
ability
entirely
while
it
is
casting,
returning
her
to
where
she
started.
Move
away
from
a
low
health
minion
at
early
game
to
avoid
the
damage
from
her
Explosive
Shot
.
Tristana
mainly
deals
damage
from
her
auto-attacks.
Randuin's
Omen
and
Frozen
Heart
are
good
options
to
counter
build
aginst
her,
since
it
will
greatly
reduce
her
damage
per
second
output.
A
Thornmail
will
counter
her
damage,
but
generally
is
a
less
better
option
since
it
helps
to
defend
only
yourself.
Try
to
not
engage
her
when
she
can
easily
escape
with
her
Rocket
Jump
and
Buster
Shot
off
cooldown.
The
exeption
is
when
you
can
hold
her
in
place
with
Crowd
Control
long
enough
to
kill
her.
If
Tristana
is
building
AP
,
be
very
cautious
and
ward
well
as
she
may
jump
out
of
nowhere
and
one-shot
you
easily.
Also,
missing
calls
can
prevent
a
lot
of
her
potential
ganks.
In
team
fights,
do
not
leave
any
squishy
teamates
in
the
front
and
prepare
some
CC
for
her
all-in.
Be
sure
to
back
away
if
your
team
have
multiple
low
health
allies.
She
may
get
multiple
kills
because
the
cooldown
of
Rocket
Jump
resets
whenether
she
gets
a
kill
or
assist
.

Cho'Gath
Champion
Background
Strategy
Skins
&amp;
Trivia
Skill
usage
Carnivore
allows
Cho'Gath
to
maintain
its
health
and
mana
,
making
it
a
great
solo
laner.
Note,
however,
that
the
mana
restore
is
fairly
low
-
it
takes
about
4
full
minion
waves
to
pay
for
1
cast
of
Rupture
.
Killing
Yorick's
ghouls
or
Heimerdinger's
turrets
will
proc
Carnivore
.
Carnivore
can
save
you
from
Ignite
if
there
are
enemy
minions
at
low
health
nearby,
even
with
the
healing
reduction
effect.
If
you
have
enough
AP,
ignited
and
probably
nothing
to
lose,
you
might
try
killing
Lesser
Wraiths
with
Rupture
.
Rupture
's
powerful
disruption
and
the
fact
that
none
of
Cho'Gath's
skills
have
reduced
cooldowns
as
they
are
leveled
makes
cooldown
reduction
very
valuable.
Place
Rupture
in
the
path
of
any
moving
enemies,
as
it
is
a
delayed
ability.
Its
delayed
nature
and
the
hard
CC
can
be
used
to
your
advantage
as
it
can
interrupt
otherwise
deadly
suppression
ultimates
like
Infinite
Duress
and
Nether
Grasp
,
provided
that
you
can
anticipate
when
they
are
going
to
be
used.
This
is
especially
powerful
against
Infinite
Duress
as
it
is
a
common
gank
initiator
and
is
more
predictable,
so
you
can
interrupt
it
by
casting
Rupture
under
yourself.
Remember
however,
that
when
saving
a
teammate
instead
of
yourself,
Feral
Scream
is
faster
and
more
efficient.
Because
of
Rupture
,
Cho'Gath
is
at
his
most
powerful
if
he
can
bait
the
enemy
into
chasing
in
a
disadvantageous
situation
or
intimate
them
into
fleeing.
Feral
Scream
is
a
strong
AoE
damage/silence
ability,
especially
in
conjunction
with
Rupture
.
Due
to
his
basic
attacks
being
melee,
you
can
first
use
Rupture
to
knock
up
your
target,
then
close
the
gap
sufficiently
within
the
time
to
silence
them
with
Feral
Scream,
preventing
effective
escaping
or
retaliation.
Due
to
the
strong
slow
applied
by
Rupture,
it
is
unlikely
they
will
be
out
of
melee
range
before
the
silence
expires,
allowing
you
to
finish
them
off
with
Feast
if
possible.
Note
that
if
you
attempt
to
fire
Feral
Scream
in
the
opposite
direction
of
your
movement,
it
would
often
be
launched
in
the
wrong
angle
and
become
counterproductive.
Getting
at
least
one
rank
of
Vorpal
Spikes
is
a
good
way
to
farm
minions.
Because
of
the
linear-splash
damage
with
each
auto-attack,
this
is
good
for
triggering
Carnivore
.
Vorpal
Spikes
and
Carnivore
allow
Cho'Gath
to
jungle.
It
can
sometimes
be
a
good
idea
to
toggle
off
Vorpal
Spikes
to
prevent
yourself
from
pushing
the
lane
too
far
and
thereby
opening
yourself
up
to
ganks.
If
you
don't
toggle
it
off
when
attacking
a
turret
,
an
enemy
champion
can
stand
near
the
tower
where
you
will
hit
them
due
to
Vorpal
Spikes's
area
of
effect
damage,
causing
the
turret
to
attack
you.
If
you're
having
difficulty
Feasting
upon
champions
,
try
eating
minions
until
you're
larger,
as
the
true
damage
you
deal
exceeds
the
health
of
most
minions.
It
is
advisable
to
gain
6
stacks
first
by
Feasting
on
minions
and
using
it
to
last
hit
enemy
champions
that
are
too
close,
since
the
damage
to
minions
is
significantly
larger
(particularly
in
early-mid
game,
since
Feast
has
a
base
damage
of
1000
against
minions,
regardless
of
Feast's
level).
This
allows
Cho'Gath
to
kill
the
Ancient
Golem
very
quickly
once
he
hits
level
6.
If
he
manages
to
secure
the
blue
buff,
he
would
be
practically
immovable
from
the
lane
due
to
it
allowing
him
to
constantly
spam
Rupture
.
If
you
want
to
push
your
lane
faster,
it's
better
to
Feast
a
Siege
Minion
for
an
instant
minion
kill
since
they're
harder
for
your
smaller
minions
to
kill.
However,
note
that
as
minions
gain
health
over
time,
if
you
have
0
ability
power,
their
maximum
health
would
become
higher
than
1000
after
12
minutes
into
the
game,
preventing
you
from
gaining
a
Feast
stack.
If
Cho'Gath
gets
Feast
stacks
before
level
11
or
16,
he
will
be
healed
for
the
difference
in
the
bonus
health
when
he
levels
Feast
.
A
red
particle
effect
will
appear
underneath
champions
that
will
die
from
Feast
.
Building
Cho'Gath
as
an
AP
burst
mage
is
reasonably
viable
because
of
his
high
AP
scalings,
and
a
true
damage
ultimate
that
could
easy
hit
over
1200
on
any
target
with
sufficient
AP.
His
main
weakness
is
he
must
go
into
melee
range
to
unload
Vorpal
Spikes
,
proc
Lich
Bane
and
use
Feast
.
However,
with
the
100%
AP
scaling
on
Rupture
,
it
would
be
better
for
him
to
use
it
as
often
as
possible,
get
a
Feral
Scream
once
in
a
while,
and
execute
weakened
enemies
with
the
aforementioned
damage
sources.
AP
Cho'Gath
has
one
of
the
most
formidable
AoE
bursts
in
the
game
along
with
the
strong
cc
applied.
However,
he
is
extremely
reliant
on
landing
Rupture
,
and
Feast
is
best
used
to
turn
around
close-quarter
fights
when
you
can't
keep
your
opponent's
at
arm's
reach
with
Rupture
.
Because
Feast
does
a
large
amount
of
true
damage,
it
is
good
for
killing
tanks
that
naturally
stacks
magic
resist,
like
Galio
.
Other
good
targets
include
champions
who
are
strongest
when
they
are
at
low
health
like
Olaf
or
Tryndamere
,
who
can
dish
out
tons
of
damage
and
heal
themselves
for
extended
periods
of
time
otherwise.
It's
true
damage
goes
through
the
Spirit
Visage
the
former
often
builds,
and
the
red
circle
indicator
helps
killing
Tryndamere
immediately
before
he
can
activate
Undying
Rage
.
The
true
damage
and
health
gain
of
Feast
along
with
the
continuous
damage
of
Vorpal
Spikes
allow
AP
Cho'Gath
to
fare
reasonably
well
against
tanks
in
general.
Cho'Gath
can
be
an
extremely
effective
pusher.
Use
Rupture
to
kill
the
3
melee
minions,
and
Feral
Scream
to
kill
the
3
caster
minions,
then
kill
the
siege
minion
with
Feast
if
necessary.
Vorpal
Spikes
helps
by
finishing
off
multiple
minions
with
small
slivers
of
health
remaining.
Be
wary
however,
as
he
is
very
vulnerable
to
ambushes
deep
into
enemy
territory.
Rupture
has
a
fairly
long
range
and
reveals
a
large
area
around
it.
Use
it
to
check
for
enemies,
but
mind
the
high
mana
cost
early
game.
Cho'Gath
synergizes
well
with
a
CC-heavy
team;
while
he
has
respectable
CC,
landing
them
without
any
help
or
the
element
of
surprise
is
quite
often
difficult.
If
his
team
can
lock
down
the
enemy
team
for
just
a
short
while,
or
even
draw
them
in
with
the
likes
of
Apprehend
,
Cho'Gath
could
lay
down
even
more
CC
much
easier
and
inflict
heavy
AoE
damage
in
an
AP
build.
Build
usage
Buying
a
Doran's
Ring
along
with
mana
regen
masteries
allows
spamming
of
Rupture
and
Feral
Scream
without
risk
of
mana
starvation,
in
addition
to
allowing
him
to
gain
health
with
Carnivore
.
Another
good
starting
item
is
a
Crystalline
Flask
allowing
Cho'Gath
to
stay
in
lane
along
with
Carnivore
.
An
early
Catalyst
the
Protector
will
grant
Cho'Gath
an
enormous
amount
of
staying
power
in
lane.
Rod
of
Ages
provides
hefty
mana,
health,
and
ability
power
which
scales
well
with
Cho'Gath's
high
base
damage.
If
your
team
has
a
tank
already,
Cho'Gath
can
switch
to
an
offtank
ability
power
build
in
order
to
do
more
damage.
Since
Feast
already
increases
Cho'Gath's
maximum
health,
he
will
still
be
difficult
to
take
down.
Buying
a
Guardian
Angel
will
make
Cho'Gath
very
hard
to
kill
if
he
stacks
Feast
.
Also,
Cho'Gath's
Rupture
knock-up
and
slow
will
help
you
run
after
being
revived.
Getting
damage
mitigation
(
Armor
and
Magic
resistance
)
instead
of
Health
is
a
good
idea,
since
Feast
already
grants
a
hefty
amount
of
health.
Items
such
as
Abyssal
Scepter
are
excellent
if
you
want
Ability
Power
,
as
they
increase
resistances
as
well.
However,
Rupture
's
range
is
noticeably
longer
than
the
Scepter.
Since
Cho'Gath's
Feast
deals
true
damage
to
champions
as
well
as
minions,
a
caster
build
on
Cho'Gath
can
allow
him
to
deal
extreme
damage
to
single
targets
and
can
easily
execute
unaware
enemies
especially
late-game
with
his
high
amounts
of
AP.
Investing
in
cooldown
reduction
items
such
as
Glacial
Shroud
(or
Fiendish
Codex
in
an
AP
build)
early
allows
more
frequent
use
of
his
ultimate
ability
to
build
Feast
stacks
quickly
and/or
to
threaten
enemy
champions
with
its
high
burst
damage
more
often.
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
is
not
as
effective
as
it
may
be,
as
all
his
basic
abilities
deal
area
of
effect
damage,
and
his
longest-ranged
ability,
Rupture
,
already
includes
a
knock-up
and
a
large
slow.
However,
as
Vorpal
Spikes
is
added
to
all
his
basic
attacks,
it
could
force
his
opponents
to
use
their
movement
abilities
to
get
out
of
his
melee
range
only
to
be
caught
up
by
Rupture
.

getting
last
hits,
to
prevent
effective
use
of
Carnivore
.
It
may
force
him
to
push
the
lane
because
all
his
ranged
attacks
deal
area
of
effect
damage.
However,
if
left
alone
he
would
quickly
heal
up.
This,
combined
with
his
low
mobility,
encourages
you
to
call
for
a
gank
and
commit
to
killing
him
instead
of
harassment.
Turret-diving
him
may
be
ill-advised,
as
the
powerful
CC
from
Rupture
will
prove
deadly
especially
in
early
game.
Try
not
to
stand
close
to
minions
at
low
health
as
it
would
allow
him
to
simultaneously
last
hit,
heal
and
harass
you.
If
Cho'Gath
is
going
AP,
try
to
shut
him
down
in
early-mid
game,
and
gank
as
much
as
possible.
He
is
very
strong
at
mid-game
farming
with
a
few
AP
items,
and
the
assists
granted
from
three
of
his
AoE
spells
along
with
his
ultimate
that
marks
targets
to
execute,
make
it
relatively
easy
to
catch
up
even
if
he
has
a
bad
early
game.
Remember
to
keep
distance
with
each
other
especially
when
ganking
Cho'Gath
,
otherwise
it
is
asking
for
him
to
AoE
cc
and
turn
the
gank
on
you.
AP
Cho'Gath
is
one
of
the
very
few
champions
in
mid
game
that
could
push
faster
than
minions
can
move
.
Ganking
him
often
would
make
him
wary
of
ambushes
and
relive
a
lot
of
your
lane
pressure
in
mid-late
game.
Try
to
ambush
him
right
after
he
uses
Rupture
for
maximum
chance
of
success.
Even
super
minions
would
have
a
hard
time
slowing
him
down,
as
his
ultimate
does
increased
damage
against
minions
and
have
a
short
cooldown.
Unlike
most
mages,
he
also
have
strong
passive
sustain
when
pushing
thanks
to
Carnivore
.
Rupture
is
Cho'Gath's
strongest
non-ultimate
ability,
and
it
is
critical
to
avoid
it
by
watching
for
its
animation.
Before
the
spikes
and
the
smoke
appear,
Cho'Gath
stomps
his
foot
on
the
ground.
While
Cho'Gath
lacks
any
conventional
gap
closers
and
escapes,
Rupture's
knock
up
and
slow
is
more
than
enough
for
him
to
catch
up
or
run
away.
There
is
also
a
red/purple
circle
around
Rupture
making
it
easier
to
spot
and
avoid.
Due
to
his
poor
mobility,
Cho'Gath
is
very
vulnerable
to
kiting
as
long
as
you
avoid
Rupture,
which
also
has
a
fairly
punishing
mana
cost.
However,
during
mid/late
game
team
fights,
avoiding
it
becomes
much
harder,
making
Cho'Gath
a
very
dangerous
AoE
threat
if
you
cluster
around
his
team's
initiator.
Try
to
move
towards
him
when
he
uses
Rupture,
as
he
tends
to
target
slightly
behind
you,
and
barely
escaping
a
Rupture
can
lure
him
into
a
bad
position.
Rupture
has
a
fairly
long
range,
but
abilities
like
Bouncing
Bomb
or
Wild
Cards
out-ranges
it
and
may
be
used
to
effectively
harass
him.
Note
however,
Bouncing
Bomb
doesn't
always
go
through
minions;
Wild
Cards
may
not
do
enough
damage
to
counter
his
passive,
and
is
fairly
easy
to
dodge.
All
of
Lux
's
abilities
out-ranges
it
and
Prismatic
Barrier
allows
her
to
shrug
off
most
of
his
harass;
just
be
careful
not
to
be
silenced.
Due
to
its
delay,
mobile
champions
like
Riven
and
Akali
would
also
help
against
him.
Master
Yi
in
particular,
as
his
Highlander
allows
him
to
ignore
Rupture's
slow,
given
that
it
could
even
hit
him
with
his
incredible
speed.
As
Cho'Gath
grows,
it
is
increasingly
difficult
to
correctly
aim
his
abilities
at
small-sized
melee
champions
that
can
whittle
him
down.
Due
to
his
lack
of
long-ranged
targeted
abilities,
untargetable
abilities
like
Alpha
Strike
or
Blade
Waltz
generally
give
him
fits.
Fizz
has
both
untargetable
effects
and
the
mobility
with
Playful
.
Gragas
could
match
him
in
sustain,
his
Barrel
Roll
will
zone
him
better
than
he
could
do
in
return,
and
also
has
the
mobility
with
Body
Slam
.
Save
your
channeled
spells
until
he
uses
his
two
CC
spells.
However,
at
max
cooldown
reduction
Rupture's
cooldown
is
only
5.4
seconds,
and
a
Cho'Gath
alternating
between
the
two
would
be
very
difficult
to
channel
against.
Be
wary
of
chasing
a
weakened
champion
into
brush
when
Cho'Gath
is
around.
It
will
make
it
much
easier
for
him
to
land
Rupture
and
the
rest
of
his
combo
on
your
entire
team,
as
well
as
negating
his
lack
of
a
gap
closer
to
kill
you
with
Feast
.
Build
magic
resistance
to
mitigate
his
damage,
but
know
that
Feast
deals
true
damage,
not
magic
damage,
and
building
health
helps
against
true
damage.
Also
note
that
practically
all
of
his
abilities
deal
magic
damage,
and
that
his
autoattacks
are
most
greatly
augmented
from
the
bonus
magic
damage
that
Vorpal
Spikes
provides.
Items
such
as
Spirit
Visage
or
Warmog's
Armor
can
greatly
negate
his
ability
to
fight
you
one-on-one.
Banshee's
Veil
will
also
make
it
difficult
for
him
to
initiate
on
you.
Two
common
anti-mage
AD
items
both
have
reduced
effectiveness
against
AP
Cho'Gath.
The
active
on
Mercurial
Scimitar
has
no
effect
on
Rupture's
knockup,
the
shield
on
Maw
of
Malmortius
has
no
effect
against
the
true
damage
from
Feast
,
and
it
also
ignores
the
magic
resist
granted
by
both
items.

Heimerdinger
Champion
Background
Strategy
Skins
&amp;
Trivia
Skill
usage
The
strength
of
Heimerdinger
lies
in
his
ability
to
hold
lanes
safely
using
his
H-28G
Evolution
Turrets
and
keep
enemies
at
a
distance
with
the
threat
of
his
Hextech
Micro-Rockets
and
CH-1
Concussion
Grenade
.
This
along
with
his
deceptive
amount
of
sustained
damage
can
catch
enemies
unawares.
A
H-28G
Evolution
Turret
can
act
as
a
ward
,
though
this
is
not
recommended
since
they
cannot
stealth,
and
auto
acquire
enemies
thereby
revealing
them,
and
offline
turrets
only
give
the
sight
range
equivalent
to
that
of
a
Noxious
Trap
.
Use
them
as
such
only
if
you
find
yourself
repeatedly
ganked.
Good
H-28G
Evolution
Turret
placement
is
crucial
to
their
effectiveness.
For
example,
placing
one
at
the
back
end
of
your
minion
wave
would
make
the
turrets
near
useless
(as
the
enemy
minions
are
far
away
from
the
turret).
Heimerdinger
is
capable
of
stagnating
the
mid
lane
and
taking
a
turret
without
ever
becoming
aggressive.
Coordinate
with
your
jungler
and
attempt
to
ward
all
possible
paths
to
mid
so
that
you
can
be
aware
of
ganks,
then
handle
laning
phase
by
maxing
H-28G
Evolution
Turret
and
focusing
on
maintaining
a
3-turret
spread
that
will
&quot;catch&quot;
and
vaporize
every
minion
wave
and
cause
your
minions
to
shove
to
the
enemy
turret.
This
does
3
very
important
things.
Firstly,
it
shrinks
the
lane
down
to
less
than
half
of
its
normal
length.
As
a
result,
the
enemy
will
have
to
CS
under
their
turret
for
almost
the
entire
game
and
you
will
have
some
soft
gank
protection.
Second,
the
turret
formation
(and
maxed
turret
level)
makes
it
too
hard
for
the
enemy
to
simply
wipe
away
the
turrets.
They
will
focus
spells
and
damage
on
taking
one
down,
and
you
can
instantly
rebuild
and
punish
them
with
a
burst
combo.
Third,
the
constant
lane
shoving
will
inevitably
cause
your
minions
to
chip
away
at
the
enemy
mid
turret.
It
is
possible
to
bring
an
enemy
mid
turret
down
without
ever
forcing
your
opponent
out
of
lane
or
using
basic
attacks
against
the
turret.
H-28G
Evolution
Turret
,
when
set
up
before
minions
appear,
can
be
used
to
disrupt
the
enemy
jungler,
forcing
an
earlier
recall,
and
giving
info
on
where
the
enemy
jungler
has
been.
The
amount
of
damage
dealt
by
your
turrets
is
based
on
when
you
place
them.
Make
sure
you
use
all
your
elixirs,
or
if
you
have
an
ally
such
as
Sona
to
have
them
boost
your
ability
power
before
placing
them.
Keeping
turrets
clustered
is
good
against
non-
AoE
based
champions.
Keeping
them
away
from
the
minion
path
cuts
down
the
AoE's
effectiveness
even
more.
A
tight
cluster
can
block
skillshots
such
as
Dark
Binding
or
Mystic
Shot
,
but
are
susceptible
to
AoE
spells
such
as
Tormented
Soil
.
Hextech
Micro-Rockets
is
an
extremely
powerful
tool
for
harassment
and
zoning
,
due
to
its
long
range
and
high
concentrated
damage,
functioning
as
Heimerdinger's
main
source
of
damage
early
game.
Hextech
Micro-Rockets
will
hit
the
first
enemy
it
makes
contact
with,
so
try
to
catch
your
opponent
in
an
open
area
before
using
it
for
maximum
effectiveness.
CH-1
Concussion
Grenade
stun
is
difficult
to
land
by
itself;
throwing
it
after
allied
disables
have
been
placed
guarantees
success.
Being
closer
to
the
target
area
is
also
helpful
as
it
lessens
the
travel
time.
Catch
an
enemy
champion
offguard
by
stunning
them
with
CH-1
Concussion
Grenade
immediately
followed
up
by
Hextech
Micro-Rockets
and
quickly
putting
H-28G
Evolution
Turret
next
to
the
target
during
the
stun.
Since
champions
usually
try
to
destroy
your
turrets
upon
sight,
especially
during
early
laning,
use
this
to
your
advantage
and
punish
them
with
Hextech
Micro-Rockets
and
CH-1
Concussion
Grenade
.
Try
to
defend
them,
as
each
turret
has
strong
sustained
damage.
However,
since
the
rework,
getting
turrets
destroyed
is
no
longer
as
detrimental
to
Heimerdinger
due
to
the
lower
mana
cost.
H-28G
Evolution
Turret
allows
Heimerdinger
to
play
defensively
and
hold
a
lane
or
push
minions
quickly.
Holding
the
lane
is
highly
recommended
as
it
is
where
Heimerdinger
shines,
being
able
to
regenerate
the
turrets'
health
and
himself.
Keep
in
mind
that
Techmaturgical
Repair
Bots
no
longer
affects
allied
turrets,
but
rather
only
Heimerdinger
,
his
turrets,
and
allied
champions.

the
next
skill

H-28Q

a
greatly
enhanced
H-28G
Evolution
Turret
that
deals
splash
damage,
charges
its
beam
attack
faster,
and
slows
its
attack
targets.
It's
best
used
as
a
defensive
tool
when
an
enemy
directly
attacks
Heimerdinger
,
or
during
a
teamfight
in
which
you
don't
need
hard
crowd
control
or
burst
damage,
as
it
deals
high
sustained
damage
that
makes
fighting
near
it
very
dangerous
for
your
enemies.

Rocket
Swarm
fires
a
barrage
of
several
waves
of
Hextech
Micro-Rockets
in
a

It's
the
strongest
and
burstier
damaging
ability
that
Heimerdinger
posseses,
although
H-28Q
Apex
Turret
deals
more
sustained
damage,
and
thus
it's
best
used
when
going
for
the
kill
on
an
oppossing
champion,
or
during
a
teamfight
in
which
a
large
burst
of
damage
is
needed.

it
Heimerdinger
's
best
enhanced
skill
for
ganks
or
teamfights
in
which
hard
crowd
control
is
required.
Build
usage
Heimerdinger
is
naturally
squishy,
and
a
tankier
build
is
suggested.
Otherwise,
he
will
be
melted
away
in
teamfights.
Tanky
AP
items
such
as
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
,
Abyssal
Scepter
,
Rod
of
Ages
and
Zhonya's
Hourglass
will
allow
Heimerdinger
to
survive
longer.
One
of
Heimerdinger
most
effective
tactics
is
to
quickly
set
up
as
many
H-28G
Evolution
Turrets
as
possible
and
an
H-28Q
Apex
Turret
and
bait
an
enemy
into
fighting
you
while
keeping
yourself
safe
with
the
Zhonya's
Hourglass
active.
This
tactic
is
most
effective
by
mid
or
late
game
where
enemies
are
more
likely
to
over
commit
to
a
fight
and
by
this
time,
your
turrets
will
be
putting
out
a
lot
of
DPS.
A
build
that
provides
good
mana
regeneration
early
game
will
allow
you
to
maintain
your
H-28G
Evolution
Turrets
in
the
lane
to
assist
with
last
hitting
minions
for
gold
.
The
mana
regeneration
will
probably
stem
from
a
Chalice
of
Harmony
,
because
using
Hextech
Micro-Rockets
in
particular
will
drain
a
lot
of
mana
at
once.
In
late
game
it
can
be
built
into
Athene's
Unholy
Grail
.
A
high
cooldown
reduction
build
will
allow
you
to
harass
the
enemy
champion
(s)
with
CH-1
Concussion
Grenade
and
Hextech
Micro-Rockets
.
A
Catalyst
the
Protector

Heimerdinger
a
good
early
game
with
some
extra
health
and
mana
and
with
a
great
passive
for
the
early
game
laning
phase.
Heimerdinger
benefits
from
an
Archangel's
Staff
greatly
early
game
because
of
the
mana/mp5/AP
it
provides.
Heimerdinger
has
little
need
for
mana
early
game
due
to
his
high
ability
cooldowns,
but
spamming
H-28G
Evolution
Turret
,
CH-1

,
and
Hextech

will
drain
your
mana

quickly.

Tactics
General
If
you're
being
pressed
against
your
tower,
set
up
your
turrets
so
that
if
the
enemy
champion
tries
to
kill
them,
they
have
to
come
within
the
tower's
range.
This
will
allow
you
to
continue
gaining
gold
off
of
last
hits
from
the
turret.
1v1
Lane
Once
you
have
Rank
4
in
CH-1
Concussion
Grenade
and
Rank
1
Hextech
Micro-Rockets
you
can
kill
the
Wraith
/
Lesser
Wraith
spawn
without
leaving
the
lane.
This
will
allow
you
to
gain
extra
experience
and
gold
to
gain
an
advantage
over
your
enemy.
If
you
can
keep
the
enemy
champion
pressed
against
his/her
tower,
you
can
gain
a
bigger
gold
/
experience
advantage
by
killing
off
their
wraith
spawn
as
well.
Having
turrets
ready
can
make
it
easier
getting
the
blue
buff,
giving
Heimerdinger
a
good
amonut
of
mana
regen
and
CDR
to
spam
his
Hextech
Micro-Rockets
.
2v2
Lane
Your
H-28G
Evolution
Turret
can
serve
as
wards
to
maintain
control
over
brush.
CH-1
Concussion
Grenade
can
be
used
to
reveal
a
large
area.
This
combined
with
its
long
range
make
it
excel
at
scouting
brush
or
jungle
areas.
Leaving
a
lane
to
buy
items
can
be
more
beneficial
to
your
lane
if
you
have
the
summoner
spell
Teleport
.
By
placing
your
turrets
in
a
bush
out
of
sight
and
recalling
within
the
sight
of
your
enemies
then
buying
items
and
using
Teleport
back
to
the
hidden
turret
can
cause
your
lane
enemies
to
over
extend
trying
to
kill
your
partner
when
you
come
out
of
the
bush
and
kill
them.
Before
leaving
a
lane,
place
both
turrets
and
then
Teleport
back
to
one
of
your
turrets
being
attacked
since
it
will
be
invulnerable
during
the
teleport
time.
1v2
Lane
Heimerdinger's
success
in
a
1v2
lane
comes
from
keeping
the
enemy
at
his
own
tower..
Using
CH-1
Concussion
Grenade
,
Hextech
Micro-Rockets
and
H-28G
Evolution
Turret
,
you
should
easily
wipe
out
attacking
minions.
Maxing
Hextech
Micro-Rockets
will
allow
you
to
spike
enemy
champions
whenever
their
minion
wave
dies
down
to
give
you
a
guaranteed
hit
on
them.
Having
at
least
rank
1
CH-1
Concussion
Grenade
gives
you
a
stun
that
you
can
use
whenever
an
enemy
champion
comes
in
range
of
the
tower
/
your
turrets.
Use
your
CH-1
Concussion
Grenade
to
reveal
areas
in
bushes
and
to
allow
use
of
Hextech
Micro-Rockets
when
a
target
is
located
in
a
bush.
Switch
to
a
more
defensive
playstyle
when
facing
pushers
in
your
lane.
(e.g
Master
Yi
,
Nunu
)
Jungle
Heimerdinger
can
be
a
unusually
good
jungler.
His
CH-1
Concussion
Grenade
can
be
used
for
fast
clears
and
his
H-28G
Evolution
Turret
can
absorb
a
lot
of
the
damage
from
monsters.
For
ganks,
try
to
set
up
your
H-28G
Evolution
Turret
in
the
enemy's
escape
route.
As
they
run
past
it,
stun
them
with
CH-1
Concussion
Grenade
and
slow
them
with
UPGRADE!!!
(if
available).
The
blue
buff
allows
you
to
purchase
other
items
without
worrying
too
much
about
mana
regen.
However,
you
might
want
to
buy
some
mana
regen
items
(such
as
Chalice
of
Harmony
or
Archangel's
Staff
)
eventually,
to
help
with
mana
when
you
don't
have
the
buff.
Plus,
Archangel's
Staff
gives
ability
power,
and
Chalice
of
Harmony
can
be
built
into
an
Athene's
Unholy
Grail
,
which
gives
Heimerdinger
much-needed
AP
and
CDR.
Countering
Heimerdinger
is
a
strong
pusher
because
of
his
turrets.
Make
sure
you
play
safe
when
laning
against
him.
Work
with
your
allies
to
take
down
his
H-28G
Evolution
Turret
before
engaging
him.
Also,
if
you
are
a
jungler
and
against
a
Heimerdinger
,
you
can
use
Smite
(if
available)
against
his
H-28G
Evolution
Turret
.
Heimerdinger's
abilities
all
deal
magic
damage.
Stack
magic
resistance
items
to
mitigate
his
damage.
Heimerdinger
has
very
strong
lane
sustain
thanks
to
his
passive,
making
him
more
prone
to
shorter
cooldown
pokes,
instead
of
long
cooldown
bursts,
as
he
will
be
able
to
regenerate
during
the
period.
However,
if
you
commit
to
fighting
him,
he
must
go
down
quickly
as
his
turrets
will
burn
through
your
health
faster
than
you
may
expect.
If
possible,
try
to
destroy
his
turrets
beforehand.
CH-1
Concussion
Grenade
will
only
stun
when
you
are
in
the
center
of
the
AoE.
Avoid
the
spell
missile
to
avoid
the
stun.
CH-1
Concussion
Grenade
missile
speed
is
slow.
If
you
see
the
spell
coming,
sidestep
it.
Beware
that
even
if
the
missile
doesn't
stun,
getting
hit
by
the
AoE
will
still
slow
you
a
significant
amount.
Be
careful
when
Heimerdinger
uses
UPGRADE!!!
as
it
allows
him
to
use
an
empowered
ability.
His
Hextech
Micro-Rockets
has
incredible
damage
potential
if
all
of
the
rockets
manage
to
hit
you.
If
Heimerdinger
throws
a
CH-1
Concussion
Grenade
into
a
bush,
he
gains
vision
of
it
regardless
of
whether
it
hits
something
or
not.
It
isn't
recommended
to
stay
in
the
bush
if
he
spots
you
in
this
manner.
Heimerdinger
is
an
incredibly
squishy
champion
if
caught
out.
Take
any
and
all
opportunities
to
attack
him
if
he
separates
from
his
turrets
or
attempts
to
roam.
Additionally,
Heimerdinger
is
weak
in
team
fights
if
he
has
no
chance
to
set
up
turrets.
If
a
team
fight
begins
and
he
is
without
his
weaponry,
have
your
team
stick
on
him
and
melt
him
as
quickly
as
possible.
If
he
is
allowed
to,
a
Heimerdinger
with
his
turrets
set
up
and
UPGRADE!!!
ready
can
be
difficult
to
penetrate,
as
a
fed
Heimerdinger
who
is
able
to
set
up
turrets
is
one
of
the
most
powerful
opponents
in
the
game.
If
all
your
abilities
are
on
cooldown,
don't
chase
him
around
his
turrets,
as
the
turret
damage
will
quickly
add
up.
Unlike
most
mages,
Heimerdinger
can
bring
down
fighters
alone
by
kiting
them
around
his
turrets
and
landing
a
good
CH-1
Concussion
Grenade
.
Try
not
to
push
Heimerdinger
to
his
turret,
as
his
passive
allow
him
to
hold
it
for
an
extremely
long
period
of
time
while
farming
easily.
His
turrets
will
also
be
hard
to
take
down
when
near
a
(real)
turret.
Heimerdinger
turrets
have
a
low
mana
cost,
so
destroying
them
will
not
affect
his
mana
much,
but
they
are
easier
to
destroy.
Be
wary
when
eliminating
them
as
he
may
be
able
to
punish
you
with
CH-1
Concussion
Grenade
,
Hextech
Micro-Rockets
,
auto
attacks,
and
the
turret
itself.
Hextech
Micro-Rockets
will
hit
the
first
enemy
unit
in
its
path.
Keeping
a
few
minions
in
between
you
and
Heimerdinger
will
negate
most
of
his
harass
ability.
The
rockets
slightly
arc
onto
their
point
of
convergence
or
can
spread
out
from
it
depending
on
where
Heimerdinger
chooses
to
fire
them.
Syndra
,
Nunu
,
Master
Yi
,
and
other
champions
with
minion-specific
abilities
can
use
those
abilities
on
Heimerdinger's
H-28G
Evolution
Turret
.
In
particular,
Syndra
can
neutralize
Heimerdinger's
turrets
by
throwing
them
out
of
the
lane.

Kha'Zix
Champion
Background
Strategy
Skins
&amp;
Trivia
Skill
usage
Enemies
are
considered
isolated
if
they
have
no
allies
within
a
short
distance.
The
damage
of
Taste
Their
Fear
is
massively
increased
against
these
targets.
This
includes
neutral
monsters
so
it
can
be
worthwhile
to
kill
off
the
lesser
monsters
first
so
the
tougher,
final
monster
will
take
considerable
extra
damage
from
Taste
Their
Fear
.
However,
this
tactic
should
be
used
selectively
as
it
does
not
noticeably
reduce
clear
time,
and
you
may
even
incur
extra
damage
by
letting
the
tougher
monster
live
longer.
Kha'Zix
works
well
with
allies
who
punish
enemies
for
staying
close
together
such
as
Alistar
or
Varus
.
He
also
works
well
with
allies
who
have
abilities
that
can
separate
and
isolate
enemies,
such
as
Gragas
and
Xin
Zhao
.
Unseen
Threat
activates
when
Kha'Zix
cannot
be
seen
by
the
enemy
team,
so
you
can
reactivate
it
by
using
brush
or
Void
Assault
.
This
can
be
used
as
an
effective
form
of
harass
in
lane
or
to
provide
steady
but
heavy
damage
output.
Unseen
Threat
can
also
be
an
effective
way
to
check
for
wards
as
Kha'Zix
will
only
receive
the
buff
when
the
enemy
team
loses
sight
of
him.
Use
the
multiple
periods
of
stealth
granted
by
Void
Assault
to
juke
enemy
skills.
Void
Assault
gives
Kha'Zix
incredibly
high
mobility
.
If
you
have
invested
an
evolution
point
into
Void
Assault
,
you
can
use
the
brief
50%
damage
reduction
to
reduce
the
impact
of
significant
burst
damage
when
timed
correctly.
When
ganking
before
level
6,
try
to
keep
Leap
available
in
case
the
enemy
uses
Flash
or
other
escape
skills.
From
levels
6
and
up,
use
Void
Assault
as
soon
as
you
leave
the
brush
in
order
to
surprise
the
enemy.
Use
the
second
cast
(or
the
third,
if
evolved)
for
its
mobility
in
case
you
need
to
chase
or
flee.
If
you
evolve
Leap
its
cooldown
refreshes
on
kill
or
assist.
You
can
double
(or
even
triple,
quadra,
or
penta)
jump
if
you
leave
wounded
(including
damage
from
you)
enemy
to
be
killed
by
your
allies.
In
this
case
you
jump
just
before
your
foe
dies
and
seconds
after
cooldown
of
your
leap
is
refreshed
meaning
you
can
jump
multiple
times.
Use
this
trick
to
surprise
your
prey
when
they
leave
their
allies
to
death
not
expecting
you
travel
such
a
great
distance
in
such
a
short
time.
When
you
evolve
abilities
you
are
adapting
for
4
different
play
styles:
Evolving
Taste
Their
Fear
grants
you
massive
burst
damage
against
isolated
champions
on
low
health;
useful
for
counter
jungling,
defending
against
opposing
counter
jungling
or
landing
a
quicker
killing
blow
on
an
isolated
champion.
Evolving
Void
Spike
grants
you
a
very
powerful
harass
and
farming
potential
early
game.
The
slow
works
both
defensively
and
offensively
to
slow
enemy
champions.
The
explosive
radius
of
Void
Spike
is
effectively
tripled,
if
shot
correctly,
allowing
for
maximum
damage
output.
(Enemies
can
only
be
damaged
by
one
explosion,
the
same
goes
for
the
heal
on
Kha'Zix
)
Evolving
Leap
grants
you
immense
ganking
potential,
due
to
the
extreme
range
(roughly
two
times
Flash
)
and
the
instant
refresh
on
killing/assisting
a
champion.
A
useful
tactic
is
to
jump
to
an
isolated
enemy,
slow
them
with
Unseen
Threat
,
do
maximum
damage
with
Taste
Their
Fear
and
following
the
kill
your
Leap
will
be
ready
for
another
gank.
Evolving
Void
Assault
grants
you
an
extra
use
of
the
Ultimate
before
going
on
cooldown;
essentially
granting
you
an
additional
use
of
the
passive,
the
speed
bonus
and
1
more
second
of
stealth.
It
will
also
grant
you
a
nice
damage
reduction
from
all
sources
except
true
damage,
including
poison
from
Singed
or
Teemo
and
AoE
burst
damage.
However,
timing
is
critical,
as
the
reduction
only
lasts
for
the
1
second
periods
of
stealth.
Build
Usage
The
Black
Cleaver
is
a
very
good
item,
as
it
grants
Kha'Zix
all
the
core
stats
he
needs
to
perform
his
role
as
an
assassin.
When
going
top,
its
possible
to
get
a
Spirit
of
the
Elder
Lizard
.
The
DoT
passive
is
good
for
exchanging
damage
in
lane,
and
the
increased
damage
on
monsters
helps
when
you
steal
camps
from
the
enemy
jungler.
It
is
a
good
idea
to
get
Mercurial
Scimitar
if
laning
against
heavy
magic
damage
dealers
such
as
Rumble
or
heavy
crowd
control
champions
like
Zac
.
When
laning
in
mid
lane,
consider
buying
a
Hexdrinker
against
burst
mages
such
as
Leblanc
or
Brand
to
help
you
survive
their
combo,
then
later
upgrade
it
to
Maw
of
Malmortius
for
better
assassination.
Building
Trinity
Force
on
Kha'Zix
if
you
are
doing
well
is
an
excellent
choice.
Because
of
its
movement
speed
boost,
damage-multiplier
and
higher
crit
chance
it
synergises
well
with
his
two
main
damage
sources:
his
auto-attacks
and
his
Taste
Their
Fear
.
Trinity
Force
also
procs
the
damage
buff
every
time
you
activate
Void
Assault
,
if
you
wait
for
the
two-second
cooldown
of
the
item
between
one
activation
and
another.
So
if
you
evolve
Active
Camouflage,
when
you
use
your
ultimate
you'll
get
three
bursts
of
damage
within
4-5
seconds.
However,
if
going
a
more
defensive
route,
Iceborn
Gauntlet
can
be
very
effective
with
the
added
armor
and
cooldown
reduction,
and
is
a
great
alternative
if
you
can't
get
the
gold
for
a
Trinity
Force
fast
enough.
The
added
slow
can
also
help
isolate
champions
better
by
zoning
them
out
and
focusing
in
on
them.
Kha'Zix
benefits
much
more
from
spell
vamp
than
he
does
from
lifesteal.
Out
of
all
the
spell
vamp
items,
the
one
most
viable
at
the
moment
on
Kha'Zix
is
Hextech
Gunblade
.
Although
AP
should
not
be
a
priority
on
him,
it
is
by
no
means
wasted
thanks
to
the
strong
heal
from
Void
Spike
and
the
damage
from
Unseen
Threat
,
both
of
which
he
should
be
constantly
procing.
He
can
build
a
Bilgewater
Cutlass
early,
and
it
can
be
upgraded
to
Hextech
Gunblade
later
in
the
game
when
cost
efficiency
is
not
that
much
of
an
issue.
Apart
from
the
stats,
the
active
from
both
items
is
very
useful.
Spirit
Visage
provides
cheap
mid-game
stats
and
gives
additional
healing
from
Void
Spike
and
any
lifesteal
or
spell
vamp
you
have
built.
The
Bloodthirster
can
be
an
impressively
devastating
item
to
stack
on
Kha'Zix
as
with
a
few
fully
stacked
Taste
Their
Fear
will
easily
achieve
1000+
base
damage
on
isolated
targets.
Stacking
The
Bloodthirster
will
also
grant
massive
sustain
from
a
few
auto
attacks,
but
be
wary,
as
they
are
no
substitution
for
defensive
items
if
you
can't
survive
the
initial
retaliation
from
enemies.
A
lack
of
movement
speed
could
also
be
a
possible
downside
to
this
strategy
requiring
a
skilled
use
of
brush
and
Unseen
Threat
to
keep
meatier
enemies
in
range.
Tiamat
is
great
on
jungling
with
Kha'Zix,
along
with
ganks.
The
extra
attack
damage
scales
with
his
abilities,
and
the
60%
splash
damage
helps
isolate
larger
jungle
creeps
in
order
to
maximize
damage.
Also,
the
splash
damage
increases
the
chance
of
isolating
a
ganked
target,
increasing
your
damage
against
them.
Upgrading
it
into
a
Ravenous
Hydra
can
be
very
effective
for
mid-late
game
fights.
However,
do
be
aware
Kha'Zix
relies
on
taking
down
targets
who
are
isolated
away
from
their
team,
so
the
splash
damage
may
be
less
effective
if
going
for
an
assassin
play
style.

Their
Fear
deals
bonus
damage
to
targets
that
are
isolated.
Take
the
advantage
by
fighting
near
allied
minions,
champions,
or
turrets.
Leap
and
Void
Assault
have
long
cooldowns
and
Kha'Zix
is
very
vulnerable
when
these
are
not
available.
Don't
fight
against
Kha'Zix
near
brush,
as
Unseen
Threat
resets
each
time
you
lose
sight
of
him,
allowing
him
to
increase
his
damage
output
by
moving
in
and
out
of
the
brush.
Kha'Zix's
appearance
changes
slightly
every
time
he
evolves;
watching
him
closely
can
give
you
a
warning
as
to
which
of
his
abilities
are
evolved.
If
his
claws
are
longer
and
serrated,
then
Kha'Zix
has
evolved
Taste
Their
Fear
,
Gaining
bonus
damage
for
it
and
his
passive
Unseen
Threat
along
with
increased
basic
attack
range.
If
the
two
rows
of
spikes
on
his
shoulders
have
gotten
bigger
then
Kha'Zix
has
evolved
Void
Spike
,
causing
him
to
shoot
three
pairs
of
spikes
instead
of
one,
covering
a
wider
area.
If
a
pair
of
wings
are
stretching
out
of
his
back,
then
Kha'Zix
has
evolved
Leap
,
greatly
increasing
its
range
and
instantly
refreshing
it
if
he
gets
a
kill
or
assist.
If
Kha'Zix's
body
has
changed
color
then
he
has
evolved
Void
Assault
,
allowing
him
to
cast
it
three
times
before
going
on
cooldown
instead
of
two
and
takes
reduced
damage.
Note
that
all
these
evolutions
will
also
show
up
as
buffs
if
you
click
on
Kha'Zix
himself.
When
laning
against
Kha'Zix
,
placing
wards
in
the
bushes
can
prevent
him
from
using
his
passive
Unseen
Threat
,
reducing
his
overall
damage
output.

Renekton
Champion
Background
Strategy
Skins
&amp;
Trivia
Skill
usage
While
some
might
have
played
manaless
champions
before,
Renekton's
Fury
resource
(shared
with
Tryndamere
and
Shyvana
)
can
catch
many
players
who
are
unfamiliar
with
Renekton
off-guard.
While
he
needs
fury
to
enhance
his
abilities,
he
does
not
need
it
to
cast
them.
Try
to
use
this
to
your
advantage.
Cull
the
Meek
heals
more
when
an
enemy
champion
is
hit;
try
to
use
this
to
your
advantage.
Empowered
Cull
the
Meek
grants
excellent
lane
sustain
thanks
to
its
increased
damage
and
healing
cap.
Take
advantage
of
this
by
building
fury,
then
hitting
as
many
enemy
minions
as
once
to
greatly
increase
your
health
gain.
Keep
in
mind
that
the
normal
version
of
Cull
the
Meek
grants
fury
while
the
empowered
version
does
not.
Ruthless
Predator
resets
the
attack
timer
after
usage,
resulting
in
a
possible
fourth
attack.
Keep
in
mind
that
Renekton
is
not
able
to
move
while
hitting
with
Ruthless
Predator
.
Slice
and
Dice
has
a
number
of
great
uses
thanks
to
its
mobility.
When
you
need
to
make
a
quick
escape,
use
Slice
and
Dice
into
a
minion
wave
or
champion.
This
will
trigger
the
secondary
effect,
allowing
you
to
use
it
again
and
clear
distance
very
quickly.
When
moving
through
the
jungle,
you
can
use
Slice
and
Dice
to
go
through
some
walls.
Ideally,
try
to
Slice
through
walls
where
you
will
hit
a
monster
camp
on
the
other
side,
allowing
you
to
cast
Dice
for
increased
chasing
or
escaping
effectiveness.
Slice
and
Dice
can
be
used
to
harass
enemies
who
have
their
abilities
on
cooldown
.
Slice
in,
land
a
few
hits,
and
Dice
back
out
of
range
in
time
before
the
enemy
champion
has
time
to
react
properly.
Remember
that
the
second,
not
the
first,
dash
of
Slice
and
Dice
with
loaded
Fury
will
activate
the
bonus.
Slice
and
Dice
in
combination
with
Ruthless
Predator
is
good
for
attacking
ranged
champions,
since
Slice
and
Dice
gets
you
close
while
Ruthless
Predator
stuns
the
target.
Once
again,
make
sure
you
slice
through
minions
or
champions
so
you
can
dice
the
rest
of
the
way
if
needed.
Slice
and
Dice
provides
excellent
mobility
for
dodging
skill
shots
in
lane.
When
you
see
an
enemy
lining
one
up
Slice
through
nearby
minions
out
of
the
way,
and
then
activate
Dice
to
further
re-position
yourself.
Although
they
aren't
on-next-attack
abilities,
Cull
the
Meek
and
Slice
and
Dice
also
reset
Renekton's
autoattack
timer.
Try
to
weave
all
his
abilities
in
between
autoattacks
to
increase
your
DPS
substantially.
These
autoattacks
also
generate
fury,
so
do
not
neglect
them!
Dominus
increases
the
range
of
Cull
the
Meek

use
this
to
your
advantage
in
team
fights.
Dominus
allows
Renekton
to
easily
win
duels
thanks
to
its
mix
of
instant
health
gain,
damage,
and
Fury
gain,
allowing
him
to
make
sudden
comebacks.
If
both
you
and
your
opponent
are
low
on
health
and
Dominus
is
available
try
to
lure
them
in
and
use
it
to
get
an
easily
kill.
Renekton
can
jungle
with
Reign
of
Anger
and
Cull
the
Meek
.
Deciding
how
to
use
Renekton's
fury
bonus
on
abilities
is
very
important.
The
added
heal
from
Cull
the
Meek
can
help
you
sustain
better
in
lane
or
in
the
jungle.
A
increased
stun
from
Ruthless
Predator
will
lock
down
an
enemy
longer
when
pursuing
or
escaping.
The
armor
reduction
from
Slice
and
Dice
is
increases
physical
damage
dealt
by
yourself
and
the
rest
of
your
team.
By
activating
Ruthless
Predator
during
a
dash
from
Slice
and
Dice's
and
selecting
a
champion
as
your
next
basic
attack,
you
can
dash
into
an
enemy
and
stun
them
immediately.
Build
usage
Renekton
is
a
tanky
attack
damage
caster,
relying
on
health
and
resistances
to
sustain
himself
in
teamfights
and
cooldown
reduction
to
maintain
his
fury.
Damage
Hexdrinker
and
Maw
of
Malmortius
are
strong
items
on
Renekton
,
providing
additional
damage
and
durability
against
magic
damage
.
Maw
of
Malmortius
scales
very
well
with
Renekton
's
passive,
Reign
of
Anger
,
due
to
increased
fury
generation
while
also
having
an
additional
20+
AD
when
below
50%
life
,
increasing
all
damage
output
significantly.
The
combination
of
The
Black
Cleaver
and
Ruthless
Predator
,
which
triggers
on-hit
effects
,
can
give
the
target
3
stacks
of
the
armor
reduction
debuff
almost
instantly.
Using
this
at
the
beginning
of
a
fight
can
decide
its
outcome.
Last
Whisper
can
be
more
effective
if
his
enemies
have
built
a
significant
amount
of
armor
.
It
works
well
regardless
of
whether
Renekton
uses
the
fury
empowered
Slice
and
Dice
.
If
you
are
having
problems
sustaining
yourself
with
Cull
the
Meek
alone,
The
Bloodthirster
/
Blade
of
the
Ruined
King
synergize
well
as
their
effects
proc
on
all
three
hits
of
Ruthless
Predator
.
Ravenous
Hydra
can
be
an
acceptable
alternative
to
The
Bloodthirster
.
The
area
of
effect
adds
to
the
other
AoEs
that
Renekton
already
has
and
the
active
can
be
used
to
cancel
the
animation
of
Ruthless
Predator
which
tends
to
undesirably
hold
Renekton
in
place.
Boots
Mercury's
Treads
are
the
standard
boots
for
Renekton
,
as
he
is
required
to
be
in
the
middle
of
skirmishes
and
thus
will
be
often
afflicted
with
crowd
control
.
Ninja
Tabi
are
good
if
laning
against
physical
damage
champions,
such
as
Riven
or
Garen
.
Ionian
Boots
of
Lucidity
grants
cooldown
reduction
,
which
is
a
valuable
stat
on
Renekton.
However,
this
item
is
only
recommended
if
Renekton
is
snowballing
or
the
team
is
tanky
enough
and
needs
more
damage.
Health
Randuin's
Omen
is
a
good
defensive
item,
offering
armor
,
health
and
a
movement
speed
slow.
Sunfire
Cape
is
a
very
useful
item
on
Renekton
as
it
synergizes
well
with
his
ultimate,
adding
even
more
AoE
magic
damage
.
It
is
also
easier
for
Renekton
to
get
into
the
middle
of
the
enemy
champions
due
to
his
Slice
and
Dice
.
Phage
gives
Renekton
some
much
needed
health
,
as
he
is
pretty
squishy
without
items
early
and
mid
game.
Frozen
Mallet
is
a
very
good
item
for
Renekton
as
its
movement
speed
slow
allows
him
to
stay
in
range
and
constantly
use
his
abilities.
Cooldown
Reduction
Spirit
Visage
can
be
a
very
good
item
when
using
Cull
the
Meek
,
since
it
boosts
all
healing
effects
by
20%
and
giving
Renekton
some
needed
cooldown
reduction
.
Zephyr
is
a
good
item
for
Renekton
as
it
provides
AD
,
attack
speed
,
movement
speed
and
most
importantly
provides
Tenacity
which
allows
him
to
use
boots
other
than
Mercury's
Treads
even
when
playing
against
champions
with
a
lot
of
crowd
control
.
The
Black
Cleaver
is
a
great
item
for
Renekton.
It
gives
attack
damage
,
cooldown
reduction
,
armor
penetration
and
a
stacking
armor
reduction
passive.
Therefore,
The
Brutalizer
is
an
essential
core
item
on
many
Renekton
players,
granting
early
AD
and
CDR.

Countering
Renekton
has
an
extremely
strong
laning
phase
and
very
high
early
game
damage
because
of
the
high
base
damage
his
abilities
have,
especially
their
Fury
Empowered
versions.
On
the
other
hand,
despite
his
strong
early
game
power,
Renekton
is
highly
vulnerable
on
being
poked
down
early
and
his
main
gap
closer,
Slice
and
Dice
is
relatively
short.
Ranged
champions
with
good
kiting
mechanics
such
as
Teemo
.
Kennen
,
Jayce
,
Ryze
,
Nidalee
,
Kayle
,
and
Lulu
can
crowd
control
Renekton
and/or
safely
create
distance
between
Renekton
and
kite
safely.
Keep
in
note
that
Renekton
does
not
use
mana
as
a
resource,
has
a
built
in
heal
with
empowered
Cull
the
Meek
,
and
can
build
common
lifesteal
items
such
as
Ravenous
Hydra
to
stay
in
lane
longer.
Build
accordingly
to
counter
him.
Watch
his
Fury
bar.
Renekton
will
usually
be
passive
until
he
gains
fury,
then
attack
you
with
Slice
and
Dice
,
hit
you
with
a
Fury
empowered
Cull
the
Meek
or
Ruthless
Predator
and
back
off
with
Slice
and
Dice's
secondary
dash.
Position
yourself
in
the
brush
and
make
yourself
hard
to
reach
for
Renekton
,
force
him
to
get
out
of
position.
Never
get
careless
against
Renekton
:
He
has
a
powerful
combination
of
a
stun
,
mobility
and
sustain.
Due
to
Renekton
's
&quot;AD
caster&quot;
playstyle,
he's
extremely
weakened
and
disrupted
by
silences
,
but
not
blinds
.
Keep
this
in
mind
when
playing
against
him.
One
of
Renekton
's
biggest
weaknesses
is
powerful
burst
nukers.
Excluding
Slice
and
Dice's
mobility,
he's
essentially
a
melee
character
that's
easy
to
be
bursted
down
from
a
range
and
kited
with
crowd
control
.
Renekton
has
a
naturally
high
health
pool,
further
complimented
by
Dominus
,
which
leaves
him
vulnerable
to
items
and
abilities
that
deal
percent
health
damage
like
Deathfire
Grasp
unless
he
has
built
resistances.
Usually
Renekton's
Slice
and
Dice
can
be
used
once,
but
if
it
hits
an
enemy,
he
gains
the
ability
to
use
it
twice.
This
will
allow
Renekton
to
cover
over
800
units
of
distance.
If
the
situation
allows
it,
don't
let
him
hit
an
enemy
with
Slice
and
Dice
,
which
can
be
difficult
as
he
can
use
the
ability
on
minions
.
At
level
6,
Renekton
gains
the
access
to
use
Dominus
.
It
can
make
turret
diving
him
a
very
difficult
task
because
he
will
quickly
be
able
to
receive
a
large
bonus
of
health
,
which
is
also
essentially
a
heal
that
cannot
be
reduced
by
Ignite
.
It
will
also
grant
him
access
to
a
lot
of
bonus
Fury
which
can
net
him
a
powerful
heal
from
Cull
the
Meek
or
an
extra
long
stun
from
Ruthless
Predator
.
Dominus
is
an
extremely
powerful
ability,
especially
in
the
early
to
mid
stages
of
the
game.
The
extra
health
makes
a
Renekton
in
this
form
more
durable
than
most
champions.
The
additional
fury
and
AoE
damage
can
enable
Renekton
to
dish
out
deceptive
and
overwhelming
amounts
of
damage,
essentially
being
able
to
kill
two
champions
by
himself
easily.
Approach
a
level
6
Renekton
with
care.
Be
sure
to
build
armor
when
playing
against
Renekton
.
He
deals
high
bursts
of
physical
damage
.
Renekton
might
choose
to
build
more
towards
damage
or
tanking.
Pay
attention
to
this:
If
you
force
him
to
build
tanky
he
will
greatly
fall
off
late
game
because
of
the
nature
of
his
kit.
If
he
builds
towards
damage,
prioritize
him
accordingly
in
teamfights
and
be
sure
to
lock
him
down
with
crowd
control
.
He
has
extremely
high
ability
ratios
but
low
survivability
outside
of
health,
sustain,
and
Dominus
.
While
tanky
DPS
Renekton
greatly
loses
power
late
game,
he's
very
difficult
to
deal
with
early
to
mid
game.
You
should
try
to
isolate
him
out
of
teamfights
and
always
know
his
location.

Evelynn
Champion
Background
Strategy
Skins
&amp;
Trivia
Skill
usage
Evelynn
is
an
effective
roamer.
Use
Shadow
Walk
to
scout
out
and
surprise
enemy
champions
that
overextend
and
possibly
get
a
kill.
This
is
most
effective
early
game.
By
roaming,
this
allows
your
solo
laner
to
farm
minions
while
keeping
the
enemy
solo
back
and
losing
them
gold
and
experience.
Evelynn
can
excel
at
pushing
a
lane
and
jungling
by
spamming
Hate
Spike
.
Try
to
stand
so
it
hits
many
creeps.
Level
up
Ravage
first
for
an
AD/On-hit
build
and
Hate
Spike
first
for
an
AP
build.
Use
Ravage
on
a
nearby
minion
when
attacking
a
tower.
Evelynn
is
a
good
partner
for
Maokai
or
Kassadin
.
Her
Hate
Spike
will
help
to
proc
Maokai's
Sap
Magic
and
Kassadin's
Force
Pulse
.
On
the
other
hand,
she
is
ineffective
against
either
of
them,
for
the
same
reason.
Your
Shadow
Walk
can
be
easily
neutralized
by
Vision
Wards
early
game.
Don't
be
too
hasty
in
attacking
early.
Take
your
time,
scope
out
the
battle
before
joining
and
use
your
element
of
surprise
to
your
advantage.
Purchasing
a
Scrying
Orb
will
enable
you
to
see
Vision
Wards
in
bushes
before
you
are
even
noticed.
Use
Dark
Frenzy
to
return
to
and
move
among
lanes
faster.
Be
careful
using
this
before
a
gank
in
case
you
need
it
to
escape.
With
a
maxed
out
Ravage
attack
speed
boost,
you
need
a
118.8%
boost
to
reach
the
cap.
Evelynn
is
a
great
scout
as
she
can
walk
past
regular
Sight
Wards
without
being
seen.
Be
wary
of
Vision
Wards
,
as
their
true
sight
can
detect
stealth
units,
however
they
can
be
seen
so
you
can
find
them,
destroy
them
and
come
back
shortly
for
a
gank.
Since
Agony's
Embrace
is
based
on
the
current
health
of
the
enemy
and
has
no
minimum
damage,
avoid
using
it
on
low-health
opponents.
The
damage
will
be
incredibly
low.
For
that
reason,
if
you
are
going
to
use
Agony's
Embrace
,
always
initiate
with
it,
so
you
do
the
most
damage,
before
your
opponent's
health
is
down.
Build
usage
Evelynn's
Shadow
Walk
takes
care
of
most
of
your
mana
issues.
If
you
are
saving
your
mana
for
harassing
only,
you
might
not
even
need
to
build
mana
items
at
all,
however,
the
low
CD
and
low
mana
cost
of
Hate
Spike
makes
it
extremely
useful
for
farming.
An
early
Sapphire
Crystal
and
its
build
path
(especially
Sheen
items)
will
drastically
improve
Shadow
Walk's
passive
mana
regen
as
it
scales
with
her
maximum
mana
.
However,
an
early
Sapphire
Crystal
can
leave
your
damage
low
until
you
buy
Sheen
,
which
is
somewhat
expensive
early
on.
The
low
cooldown
on
Hate
Spike
allows
Evelynn
to
make
full
use
of
Lich
Bane
/
Trinity
Force
/
Iceborn
Gauntlet
giving
her
a
large
damage
boost
and
making
one
of
these
a
core
item
for
her.
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
to
constantly
slow
enemies.
Quickly
max
Tear
of
the
Goddess
/
Archangel's
Staff
/
Manamune
.
Though
the
mana
regen
isn't
really
needed
with
her
Shadow
Walk
.
They
can
be
cost
effective
if
you
have
a
lot
of
other
mana
items,
such
as
Frozen
Heart
,
Iceborn
Gauntlet
,
and
Trinity
Force
.
It
also
helps
quickly
stack
Guinsoo's
Rageblade
making
it
very
cost
effective
for
a
DPS
build,
but
not
a
burst
build
since
you
won't
have
the
stacks
when
you
need
to
burst
someone.
With
both
AD
and
AP,
her
AS
buff
can
effectively
mix
and
match
any
offensive
item.
See
what
defenses
the
enemy
is
building
so
you
can
adapt
within
your
build.
For
instance,
if
they
build
Thornmail
when
you're
playing
Hybrid,
build
Wit's
End
instead
of
Trinity
Force
.
If
they
all
build
magic
resist
then
avoid
building
AP.
If
they
build
health,
then
Deathfire
Grasp
with
AP
+
CDR
for
your
ult
can
help,
but
items
with
sustain
such
as
Hextech
Gunblade
or
Blade
of
the
Ruined
King
can
let
you
fight
tanks
indefinitely,
and
can
also
be
a
good
choice.
Some
good
items
are:
AD
(
The
Black
Cleaver
/
Trinity
Force
,
Infinity
Edge
,
or
The
Bloodthirster
).
For
more
single
target
damage
and
sustained
damage
against
low-mid
range
armored
targets
if
you
buy
Black
Cleaver.
AP
(
Archangel's
Staff
,
Rabadon's
Deathcap
,
and
Lich
Bane
).
For
more
multi-target
damage
and
better
burst.
On-Hit
(
Nashor's
Tooth
,
Blade
of
the
Ruined
King
and
Wit's
End
).
For
high
single
target
damage
against
low
magic
resist
targets.
*See
below
for
the
attack
speed
cap.
Hybrid
(
Trinity
Force
,
Wit's
End
Hextech
Gunblade
and
Guinsoo's
Rageblade
).
For
a
balance.
Hybrid
is
squishy
if
you
invest
purely
in
offensive
power,
and
since
it
relies
on
being
in
melee
range,
you
will
usually
need
to
have
at
least
2
tanky
items
to
survive.
For
mixed
melee
and
spell
damage,
single
and
AOE
targets
with
a
mix
of
survivability
as
well
as
mid-high
armor,
magic
resistance
and
hit
point
targets
you
can
utilize
an
item
set
such
as:
Iceborn
Gauntlet
,
Liandry's
Torment
,
Spirit
of
the
Elder
Lizard
,
and
The
Black
Cleaver
.
This
will
maximize
damage
penetration
as
well
as
provide
defense,
crowd
control
and
destroy
high
hit
point
targets
with
high
efficiency
as
well
as
allowing
her
to
wave
clear
minions
and
monster
camps
with
extreme
ease.
It
will
also
apply
all
three
types
of
damage
while
providing
two
DoT's
to
an
escaping
target.
Finishing
the
build
off
with
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
and
a
pair
of
Sorcerer's
Shoes
provides
maximum
damage
and
maintains
the
target/target's
will
never
escape
while
producing
more
damage
AND
survivability.
Note
that
Evelynn
is
inherently
squishy,
so
any
melee
oriented
builds
must
have
some
items
devoted
to
tankiness,
such
as
Iceborn
Gauntlet
or
Randuin's
Omen
.
Actually,
all
builds
require
Evelynn
to
get
very
close
to
blow
her
target,
particularly
if
she
wants
to
hit
Ravage
that
is
her
main
instant
nuke
by
late
game,
both
on
AP
(very
high
ratio)
and
AD
(high
ratio)
she
has
to
nearly
get
to
melee
range.
If
you
notice
focus
into
you,
for
AD
the
aforementioned
items
might
suffice,
but
a
Frozen
Mallet
makes
Evelynn
more
undesirable
to
focus
and
resilient
to
upfront
burst,
it
offer
little
damage
however
and
should
only
be
obtained
if
under
heavy
focus
For
AP
you
can
grab
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
or
Rod
of
Ages
.
While
you
won't
normally
buy
both
you
might
need
to
if
you
find
yourself
under
heavy
focus.
Since
Ravage
gives
you
120%
attack
speed
bonus,
you
can
reach
the
2.500
attack
speed
cap
very
easily.
Try
to
not
get
more
than
about
100
additional
AS.
Speed
items,
such
as
Phantom
Dancer
and
Boots
of
Mobility
allow
you
to
gank
a
lot
faster
and
gain
extra
kills,
keep
enemies
more
uncertain
where
you
are,
and
help
you
escape
if
you're
seen
out
of
position.
Keep
in
mind
that
slows
are
more
powerful
than
Hastes
(Movespeed
buffs),
and
that
movespeed
items
do
not
give
much
tankiness,
so
if
you
are
caught
or
like
going
into
melee
range,
a
tankier
item
would
be
better
thanks
to
the
movespeed
bonus
from
Dark
Frenzy
.
Think
twice
before
buying
enemy
affecting
aura
items
such
as
Frozen
Heart
as
the
enemy
can
notice
these
affects
from
a
distance,
alerting
them
to
your
presence
and
possibly
ruining
your
surprise.
Ally
affecting
aura
items
can
also
be
noticed,
but
with
more
difficulty.
This
is
not
an
issue
with
Abyssal
Scepter
due
to
this
item
having
only
600
range,
while
Evelynn's
stealth
range
is
700.

Countering
Always
look
out
for
Evelynn
in
your
lane.
Because
of
her
stealth,
she
can
easily
sneak
behind
unsuspecting
players
who
are
overextended.
Be
aware
that
her
movement
speed
boost
can
make
her
very
surprising.
You
can
protect
your
lane
by
purchasing
Vision
Ward
s
and
placing
them
in
the
river.
Be
careful
if
using
Sight
Ward
s
as
if
she
comes
into
your
brush
already
stealthed,
you
will
not
be
able
to
see
her
until
she
unstealths,
and
that
may
be
too
late.
Evelynn
can
be
built
with
either
Ability
Power
,
Attack
Damage
or
even
a
mix
of
both.
Pay
attention
to
the
way
she
builds
to
better
decide
what
defensive
items
you
should
buy.
However,
she
still
deals
a
lot
of
magic
damage
even
with
an
Attack
Damage
build,
so
Magic
Resistance
is
rarely
a
bad
option
against
her.
If
Evelynn
is
building
AD,
she
has
a
very
weak
early
and
mediocre
mid,
but
trades
for
extremely
high
damage
late
game.
If
you
are
a
squishy
champ,
stay
behind
tanks
and
try
to
focus
her
down.
Evelynn's
stealth
is
lost
when
she
takes
damage.
Harassing
her
greatly
reduces
her
sneaking
ability.
If
you
think
Evelynn
is
near,
use
skill
or
AoE
spells
(Like
a
Ziggs's
Bouncing
Bomb
or
Ezreal's
Mystic
Shot
)
in
her
direction.
If
they
hit
it
will
disable
her
passive
and
reveal
her.

Background

Skins
&amp;
Trivia
Skill
usage
Duelist's
regeneration
effect
stacks
up
against
champions,
so
don't
be
afraid
to
engage
in
small
skirmishes.
Because
Crowd
Control
is
a
vulnerability
of
Fiora,
consider
taking
the
Cleanse
summoner
spell.
Lunge
is
a
mechanically
simple
skill,
but
it
has
a
lot
of
nuances
to
its
usage.
Lunge
is
often
underestimated
for
its
damage,
especially
at
early
levels
of
the
game.
A
quick
double
click
on
the
same
champion
works
as
a
decent
nuke.
Remember
that
while
most
of
Fiora's
damage
comes
from
her
W,
Lunge
is
an
ability,
so
it
can
pierce
through
statuses
like
blind
and
Counter
Strike
to
deal
damage.
To
maximize
damage
output,
apply
as
many
autoattacks
as
you
can
before
using
the
second
Lunge
.
Activate
Burst
of
Speed
before
using
Lunge
for
best
results;
the
extra
movement
speed
will
gain
a
stack
from
Lunge
,
allowing
you
to
continue
attacking
the
target,
and
finally
use
the
second
Lunge
to
further
damage
the
enemy.
Make
good
use
of
Lunge's
second
cast
to
stick
to
your
target;
if
the
enemy
has
their
own
mobility
or
escaping
skills,
try
to
force
them
to
use
it
prior
to
your
second
Lunge
cast.
If
you're
chasing
an
enemy
champion
that's
too
far
use
Lunge
on
a
enemy
minion
and
use
its
second
dash
to
catch
up.
You
can
use
Lunge
to
dash
through
walls,
though
you
have
to
be
able
to
see
your
target.
Placing
a
ward
near
jungle
mobs
can
allow
for
an
easy
escape
route.
A
good
harrassing
strategy
is
to
use
Lunge
's
first
cast
to
go
in
and
immediately
using
Riposte
(you
can
even
use
it
mid-air);
an
opponent's
most
normal
reaction
is
to
attack
you
right
after
you
lunge,
triggering
Riposte
damage.
Land
a
basic
attack
or
two,
then
use
your
Lunge
second
cast
into
an
enemy
minion
that
is
further
away
to
escape.
This
is
only
effective
against
melee
champions,
as
ranged
can
still
counter
after
you
retire.
Don't
use
Burst
of
Speed
in
this
way
as
you
only
have
a
short
amount
of
time
to
land,
at
best,
one
or
two
attacks
and
back
off
due
to
Lunge
second-cast
short
timer.
This
is
unless
you
intend
on
killing
your
opponent,
then
use
Burst
of
Speed
early
and
save
the
second
lunge
cast
to
continue
the
chase.
Try
to
use
Riposte
when
the
enemy
is
already
in
half-swing
or
when
their
ranged
basic
attack
is
in
mid
flight.
Riposte
can
be
also
used
to
counter
a
variety
of
abilities,
such
as
Ezreal's
Mystic
Shot
,
Gangplank's
Parrrley
,
and
Nasus's
Siphoning
Strike
.
Against
melee
champions
Riposte
is
much
harder
to
successfully
parry
an
attack
with,
due
to
the
near-instant
attack
time.
Unless
your
opponent
is
predictable,
it
may
not
be
worth
it
to
bait
attacks
hoping
to
apply
the
parry
damage.
Fiora's
skill
order
is
not
set
in
stone,
and
varying
it
depending
on
the
game's
situation
can
make
you
much
more
effective.
Skilling
Lunge
makes
it
gain
a
decent
amount
of
damage,
but
more
importantly
greatly
reduces
its
cooldown.
This
can
make
all
the
difference
in
chasing
opponents,
especially
those
with
mobility
skills
that
could
otherwise
evade
and
kite
Fiora
.
Max
this
first
by
default,
as
its
the
most
reliable
way
to
increase
Fiora's
skirmish
damage
against
most
lane
opponents.
Riposte
improves
Fiora's
offense
while
providing
a
situational
defensive
move.
Parrying
attacks
constantly,
especially
enhanced
attack
abilities,
can
save
your
life.
The
passive
AD
bonus
is
also
quite
sizable
and
improves
all
your
other
abilities'
effectiveness
to
a
small
degree.
Max
this
first
when
fighting
champs
with
good
poke
and
sustain,
such
as
Gangplank
and
Nidalee.
Burst
of
Speed
becomes
an
incredibly
potent
steroid
when
maxed
out,
and
most
champions
will
be
unable
to
keep
up
with
Fiora's
sustained
damage
while
it
is
active.
However,
it
is
easily
countered
by
saving
crowd
control
abilities
until
after
it
is
activated.
Max
this
first
when
jungling,
and
when
your
lane
opponent
lacks
CC;
you'll
usually
want
to
max
this
second
otherwise.
Burst
of
Speed
gives
a
huge
attack
speed
boost
so
it
can
be
used
to
effectively
push
turrets.
Blade
Waltz
not
only
deals
damage,
but
also
prevents
targeting
from
enemy
abilities.
Blade
Waltz
makes
you
untargetable
for
the
duration
of
the
ability
and
also
removes
turret
aggro
from
Fiora
,
so
it
can
be
used
to
finish
off
low
health
enemies
hiding
under
their
turret.
Blade
Waltz
basically
counts
as
5
separate
basic
attacks.
Hence,
it
will
proc
all
on-hit
effects
and
be
affected
by
any
other
autoattack
modifiers
(except
for
attack
speed
buffs/debuffs
and
crits),
including
the
summoner
spell
Exhaust
.
However,
all
proc
on-hit
effects
will
stack
after
the
first
attack,
granting
only
4
procs
(the
first
hit
starts
at
0,
the
second
at
1,
and
so
on,
etc.)
If
you
are
caught
at
low
health
and
have
strong
life
steal,
use
Blade
Waltz
to
deal
massive
damage
and
restore
a
large
portion
of
health
from
it.
Although
you
are
protected
from
targeting
for
the
duration,
be
aware
that
Damage
over
Time
(cast
before
Blade
Waltz
)
will
still
damage
Fiora.
Build
usage
Ravenous
Hydra
shines
on
Fiora,
giving
her
a
significant
boost
to
damage,
out-of-combat
sustain,
in-combat
sustain,
and
waveclear,
as
well
as
allowing
Fiora
Fiora
to
deal
splash
damage
to
nearby
enemies.
It's
also
easier
to
build
than
The
Bloodthirster
,
as
its
individual
components
each
cost
less
than
900g
to
purchase;
build
early
if
you
plan
on
using
it,
as
this
will
be
your
core
AD
stat
item.
Don't
forget
to
use
the
active
ability!
If
building
Fiora
strictly
as
an
assassin
(rather
than
a
carry),
her
role
becomes
picking
off
low
health
and/or
high
priority
targets,
making
Tiamat
or
Ravenous
Hydra
debatable
choices
on
her
even
with
Idol
of
Durand
on
your
team
since
they
cost
a
fair
bit
of
money
for
items
that
don't
tremendously
augment
your
single-target
damage,
especially
when
Fiora's
primary
targets
are
often
back-lines
characters
who
won't
be
standing
near
enough
to
anything
for
the
splash
damage
to
actually
hit
anything.
With
Burst
of
Speed
,
Fiora
can
down
towers
very
fast.
Ravenous
Hydra
can
be
useful
when
used
to
speed
up
Fiora's
wave
clearing.
This
can
turn
Fiora
into
a
very
effective
split
pusher;
if
you're
at
the
point
where
you
can
destroy
any
single
enemy
champion
1v1
in
a
duel
regardless
of
tower
proximity,
this
can
force
the
opposing
team
to
commit
numbers
to
counter
you,
allowing
your
team
to
secure
other
map
objectives.
The
Black
Cleaver
will
reduce
armor
on
every
hit
of
her
ultimate
Blade
Waltz
and
therefore
increasing
the
damage
dealt.
In
teamfights
where
your
Blade
Waltz
can
hit
multiple
targets,
the
armor
reduction
will
be
very
helpful.
Combine
with
Tiamat
/
Ravenous
Hydra
to
shred
armor
on
any
champions
struck
by
the
splash
damage,
potentially
granting
maximum
Cleaver
stacks
on
every
enemy
champion
in
a
teamfight
and
boosting
primary
target
damage
on
each
strike.
In
a
1v1
case,
the
armor
reduction
will
greatly
increase
your
already
impressive
damage
from
Blade
Waltz
.
The
additional
health
is
welcome
too!
Last
Whisper
as
a
third
or
even
second
item
can
massively
increase
Fiora's
damage
output,
particularly
from
her
ultimate
Blade
Waltz
(which
enjoys
high
base
damage).
Even
early
on
when
combined
with
armor
penetration
runes/masteries
and
The
Brutalizer
,
the
resulting
22
flat
penetration
and
35-45
%
penetration
is
enough
to
hit
most
unarmored
targets
for
true
damage.
With
a
Ravenous
Hydra
or
The
Bloodthirster
,
you
can
often
&quot;100
to
zero&quot;
enemy
carries
with
just
five
strikes
of
your
ult,
without
even
factoring
in
the
rest
of
your
abilities.
Building
life
steal
is
very
important
for
Fiora
as
it
allows
her
to
regenerate
large
quantities
of
health
while
she
is
untargetable
during
Blade
Waltz
.
Unlike
many
other
attack
damage
carries,
Phantom
Dancer
can
be
built
but
isn't
necessary
on
Fiora
because
she
already
gets
a
huge
attack
speed
boost
and
a
movement
speed
boost
from
Burst
of
Speed
.
Statikk
Shiv
normally
gains
10
charges
per
attack
but
the
5
attacks
of
Blade
Waltz
also
count
as
movement
by
various
amounts.
It
is
fairly
common
for
Blade
Waltz
to
proc
the
Shiv
with
the
first
strike,
yet
the
Shiv
will
have
75-100
charges
by
the
end
of
it.
Crowd
control
directly
counters
Fiora's
usefulness,
making
Mercury's
Treads
,
Zephyr
,
Quicksilver
Sash
or
a
Banshee's
Veil
good
items
to
consider
if
you
find
yourself
being
CC'd
regularly.
One
can
build
her
as
a
glass
cannon
carry
with
items
like
Phantom
Dancer
,
The
Bloodthirster
,
and
Infinity
Edge
.
Or,
one
can
opt
to
build
her
as
a
more
tanky
DPS
type
with
proc
effects
using
items
like
Frozen
Mallet
and
Wit's
End
.
Fiora
can
be
built
in
a
&quot;critless&quot;
manner
as
well
due
to
her
high
AS.
Items
like
The
Bloodthirster
,
The
Black
Cleaver
,
and
Wit's
End
can
be
used
to
increase
her
damage
output
in
such
a
build.
It
should
be
noted
that
Youmuu's
Ghostblade's
active
is
very
useful
in
this
type
of
a
build.
This
type
of
a
build
along
with
items
like
Wriggle's
Lantern
and
Frozen
Mallet
allow
Fiora
to
be
rather
tanky.
If
one
is
running
Armor
Penetration
runes,
it's
a
good
idea
to
get
both
The
Black
Cleaver
and
Youmuu's
Ghostblade
on
her,
since
she
can
receive
the
full
stacks
for
the
armor
shred
easily.
Bilgewater
Cutlass
can
fill
a
powerful
niche
in
Fiora's
kit,
granting
her
good
life
steal,
decent
damage,
and
a
slowing
active.
Upgrading
into
Blade
of
the
Ruined
King
further
improves
the
lifesteal
and
active
while
also
granting
just
the
right
amount
of
additional
base
attack
speed
Fiora
needs.
Consider
buying
this
item
early
against
teams
with
high-health
champs
and
keepaway
comps,
as
it
mitigates
many
of
Fiora's
weaknesses
and
allows
you
to
focus
the
rest
of
your
build
on
raw
damage
output.
Wit's
End
is
also
useful
as
it
will
proc
on
all
hits
of
her
ultimate,
Blade
Waltz
,
without
the
75%
reduction
for
hitting
the
same
target.
This
effectively
adds
210
magic
damage
to
Blade
Waltz
.
Along
with
the
magic
resistance
and
AS
that
it
provides,
the
item
is
very
useful
on
Fiora,
especially
if
the
opponent
team
is
AP
heavy
or
if
an
AP
heavy
champ
constantly
focuses
you.
When
jungling
Fiora,
Spirit
of
the
Ancient
Golem
is
probably
your
go-to
jungle
item,
as
it
gives
Fiora
some
much-needed
resilience
to
damage
and
CC,
allowing
you
to
focus
the
rest
of
your
build
on
damage
output.
Spirit
of
the
Elder
Lizard
is
a
fine
alternative
if
you're
a
fan
of
Mercury's
Treads
or
Zephyr
.

Countering
Fiora
is
adept
at
dealing
a
lot
of
physical
damage
quickly,
making
armor
a
clear
method
of
protecting
yourself.
In
the
top
lane,
Ninja
Tabi
is
a
highly
effective
way
to
become
deceptively
hard
to
kill
to
Fiora.
Buying
Thornmail
is
a
very
good
option
as
Fiora
relies
heavily
on
basic
attacks
to
cause
damage
and
it
would
benefit
almost
every
member
of
the
opposing
team
and
increase
their
survival
chance.
A
crowd
control
effect
applied
on
Fiora
when
she
activates
Burst
of
Speed
will
severely
lower
her
damage
output.
In
addition,
if
she
is
unable
to
autoattack
or
use
Lunge
during
the
3
second
duration,
she
will
not
gain
bonus
movement
speed.
Fiora
is
considered
a
late
game
AD
hyper
carry;
as
such,
she
must
be
shut
down
at
every
given
moment,
as
she
snowballs
deadly
and
quickly
Another
good
option
is
attack
speed
grinders
such
as
Warden's
Mail
,
Randuin's
Omen
and
Frozen
Heart
,
these
all
give
armor
and
an
attack
speed
debuff.
If
Fiora
runs
bottom
lane,
focusing
her
early
and
often
with
crowd
control
and
heavy
damage
is
a
great
way
to
shut
down
her
mid
game,
due
to
Fiora
easily
(Much
more
so
than
other
champs)
falling
behind
from
not
getting
early
kills
or
assists.
If
she
uses
Blade
Waltz
recklessly,
you
can
run
towards
a
friendly
turret
and
CC
her
upon
reappearance.
Fiora
is
strongly
countered
by
anti
AD
champions,
such
as
Jax
,
Rammus
and
Malphite
.
Jax
is
a
great
1v1
top
lane
counter
due
to
his
Counter
Strike
which
can
completely
avoid
Blade
Waltz
.
As
well
as
the
bonus
armor
from
Grandmaster's
Might
will
reduce
the
damage
from
all
of
her
other
forms
of
offense.
Rammus
counters
her
with
his
anti-AD
abilities
such
as
Defensive
Ball
Curl
,
and
his
tendency
to
build
up
armor
to
stack
with
Spiked
Shell
.
Malphite
can
take
her
on
with
his
Brutal
Strikes
granting
him
incredible
amounts
of
armor
and
Ground
Slam
reducing
her
attack
speed
considerably.
In
general,
long
range
harass,
zoning,
and
running
go
a
long
way
to
controlling
a
Fiora
at
the
top
lane,
because
she
has
no
reliable
short
cooldown
ranged
attack.
