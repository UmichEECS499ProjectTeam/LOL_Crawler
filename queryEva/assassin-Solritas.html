Champions
generally
fall
into
certain
categories
based
on
their
skills.
These
are
also

and
are
used
on

on

page.

Categories
Standard
tags
Those
categories
are
copied
exactly
from
the
game
client,
and
will
be
listed
on
each
champion
normal
page.
Note
that
some
champions
are
capable
of
more
than
just
the
role
or
roles
they
are
listed
under.
A
champion's
abilities,
items
they
gain
throughout
the
game,
and
one's
ability
to
fulfill
that
duty
determine
what
role
they
assume
in
gameplay.
As
of
V3.10
,
tags
for
secondary
attributes
are
no
longer
visible
in
the
game
client,
but
have
been
retained
here
for
information
purposes.
Primary
Attributes
Assassin
:
Champions
with
mediocre
auto-attacks
and
defense,
who
specialize
in
killing
their
enemies
quickly.
These
champions
usually
are
physical
attackers
and
are
DPS-based
(Damage
per
second)
or
are
AP
(ability
power)
burst
oriented.
Many
of
them
have
some
form
of
invisibility
or
blinking
ability
which
lets
them
choose
the
right
moment
to
step
in
or
out
of
a
fight.
They
should
focus
on
items
that
will
increase
the
damage
they
put
out
over
a
short
period
of
time.
In
fights,
they
play
a
role
as
sneak
attackers
of
key
targets
(like
the
marksman
or
the
mage),
who
pick
off
weak
enemies
and
carry
champions
at
the
right
time.
They
should
not
be
played
for
frontal
engagements
in
team
fights
since
they
lack
good
defense
compared
to
fighters
and
tanks.
Assassins
focus
on
timing
and
positioning,
rather
than
brute
strength
or
defense,
to
ensure
their
kills.
Assassins
usually
kill
marksmen,
supports,
and
most
mages
with
ease,
but
perform
worse
against
fighters
and
tanks.
Fighter
(also
known
as
Bruiser
or
Off-tank
):
Champions
that
blend
the
attributes
of
a
damager
and
tank,
combining
moderate
to
heavy
survivability
with
a
portion
of
the
damage
of
an
assassin
or
marksman
(essentially
half
tank,
half
DPS).
They
lack
the
front-loaded,
destructive
damage
of
their
pure
DPS
counterparts,
but
usually
have
abilities
which
increase
their
damage
output
or
abilities
with
high
damage
bases,
making
them
deadlier
in
the
early
game.
Fighters
can
build
to
be
extremely
survivable,
but
the
key
distinction
between
tanky
fighters
and
true
tanks
is
that
tanks
are
designed
to
draw
damage
and
disrupt
enemies,
while
fighters
deal
damage.
In
a
team
fight,
fighter
champions
can
surrogate
the
role
of
a
tank
or
assassin,
and
many
have
powerful
fight-initiation
abilities.
With
their
special
blend
of
defense,
damage,
and
mobility,
fighters
can
pierce
through
enemy
lines
to
reach
and
destroy
squishier
targets
while
withstanding
moderate
damage.
Fighters
can
usually
take
1v1
almost
any
other
role,
however
their
weakness
is
that
they
can't
dish
out
damage
as
reliably
as
a
marksman
or
as
quickly
as
a
mage
or
help
as
support;
usually,
their
role
in
late-game
is
more
to
defend
or
back
up
the
primary
damage
dealers
in
a
team
fight.
Most
fighters
fall
off
in
late
game
due
to
their
abilities
having
low
scaling
ratios
(but
very
high
bases).
Mage
:
(also
known
as
APC
:
Ability
Power
Carry
)
Mostly
ranged
champions
with
powerful
magic
damage
skills,
good
crowd
control
or
a
combination
of
both,
but
low
defense
and
weak
auto-attacks.
Some
are
meant
to
deal
a
high
amount
of
damage
in
a
short
period
of
time
(burst
casters/burst
mages)
while
others
usually
deal
damage
over
time;
however,
even
DoT
mages
tend
to
have
at
least
one
nuke.
Most
mages
present
the
user
with
a
flexible,
versatile,
and
powerful
skillset.
Like
marksman
champions,
they
can
bring
their
team
to
victory
due
to
their
ability
power
,
but
burst
based
mages
tend
to
fall
of
a
bit
at
late
game.
They
require
tanky
teammates
for
protection
since
they
lack
high
durability
as
they
are
capable
of
dishing
out
tremendous
damage
to
the
enemy
team
with
their
abilities.
Otherwise,
enemy
teams
can
easily
pick
them
off,
especially
since
few
mages
have
outstanding
mobility.
Mage
champions
easily
kill
marksmen,
other
mages
and
supports
(assasins
too,
but
they
have
to
get
caught
out
of
position
or
by
surprise),
and
a
few
mages
with
supreme
bursts
can
even
kill
fighters
1v1,
however,
the
large
majority
of
mages
can't
hit
hard
enough
to
kill
a
fighter
and
those
who
can
have
to
channel
a
combo(
Malzahar
)
or
take
a
while
to
fully
execute
their
skills
(
Syndra
,
Xerath
)
Some
mages
work
more
like
marksmen,
having
high
sustained
damage
rather
than
the
&quot;burst&quot;,
normally
associated
with
mages;
this
trait
allows
them
to
take
on
tanks
and
fighters
more
effectively,
though
mages
with
this
trait
are
less
effective
against
quick
damage
dealers
like
assassins.
Some
mages
have
abilities
with
high
base
damage,
and
if
they
are
doing
well,
they
can
get
somewhat
tankier
or
supportive
without
sacrificing
much
damage.
Range
between
mages
is
very
defining;
low
ranged
mages
have
to
build
tanky
ability
power
items,
otherwise
they
would
die
as
soon
as
they
enter
their
damage
range.
The
short
range
comes
with
rewards
however,
higher-than
usual
damage
(either
sustained
or
up-front
but
extremely
high)
(
Cassiopeia
,
Swain
,
LeBlanc
,
or
Vladimir
),
outstanding
crowd
control
(
Lissandra
)
or
naturally
increased
tankyness
and
survivality
(
Swain
,
or
Vladimir
).
The
long
ranged
ones
on
the
other
hand,
can
freely
build
&quot;glass
cannon&quot;
as
they
have
either
extremely
long
range
(
Xerath
)
or
are
very
hard
to
catch
or
kill
(
Lux
,
or
Nidalee
).
Marksman
:
(also
Known
as
ADC
:
Attack
Damage
Carry
or
just
Carry
)
Champions
with
high
auto-attack
damage,
usually
long
range,
but
low
defense.
Most
marksmen
have
skills,
passive
or
active,
that
scales
with
their
stats,
such
as
an
increase
in
Base
Damage
and
Attack
Speed
or
allowing
them
to
keep
themself
safe,
and
rely
on
their
auto-attack
to
dish
out
damage.
Marksman
champions
are
extremely
effective
late-game
at
&quot;carrying&quot;
the
team
to
victory,
either
by
killing
off
key
players
on
the
enemy
team
or
dealing
large
damage
in
team
fights
because
they
have
tremendous
damage
output,
but
low
defense.
Due
to
this,
they
are
key
champions
and
are
primary
targets
for
enemy
team
.
As
a
result,
they
require
tanky
teammates
like
fighters
and
tanks
for
protection
as
they
lack
survivability.
Some
marksmen
function
more
like
ranged
AD
casters
that
are
more
dependent
on
casting
skills
that
deal
high
amounts
of
burst
damage
than
autoattacking
(
Ezreal
,
Miss
Fortune
,
and
Graves
).
Other
marksmen
are
more
reliant
on
autoattacking
and
more
focused
on
building
attack
speed
,
Critical
chance,
items
that
boosts
their
autoattacks
(i.e.
Blade
of
the
Ruined
King
),
and
life
steal
instead
for
damage
per
second
(
Tristana
,
Vayne
,
and
Kog'Maw
)
Marksmen
can
only
usually
beat
supports
and
tanks
1v1
but
kill
everything
if
they
are
protected.
Due
to
their
low
health
marksmen
are
almost
always
beaten
by
the
high
burst
that
Mages
output.
Due
to
(most)
marksmen
not
being
all
too
reliant
on
abilities,
rather
using
autoattacks
to
deal
damage,
they
are
capable
of
dealing
a
lot
of
damage
over
a
longer
period
of
time
compared
to
mages.
Support
:
Champions
whose
skills
are
meant
to
directly
aid
the
rest
of
the
team.
They
can
either
babysit
a
champion
to
make
laning
easier
for
them
by
providing
healing,
buffing
allies,
applying
debuffs
to
the
enemy
team,
or
a
combination
of
the
above.
The
most
common
ability
for
a
support
champion
is
providing
an
ally
with
a
shield
of
some
kind
or
annoying
the
enemy
with
some
form
of
strong
crowd
control.
One
of
the
main
goals
of
a
support
is
to
let
their
lane
partner
farm
minions
for
gold,
as
supports
can
buy
key
gold+
items
to
get
gold
for
themselves,
as
well
as
controlling
the
map
with
wards,
warding
all
key
areas
of
the
map.
These
champions
usually
rely
on
their
skills
more
than
their
auto-attack.
Supports
can't
really
kill
anything
but
other
supports
on
their
own,
but
their
buffs
and
harsh
CC
makes
them
deadly
when
paired
along
with
any
other
role
but
tanks.
A
few
supports
have
ability
power
ratios
high
enough
to
let
them
become
mages,
and
a
few
mages
have
supportive
abilities/aggressive
crowd
control
which
lets
them
become
supports.
Supports
can
often
use
their
CC
to
interrupt
assassins
and
protect
nearby
mages
and
marksmen.
Tank
:
Champions
with
extremely
high
defense,
health,
and
crowd
control
abilities,
but
low
attack
damage
or
poor
ability
power
scaling.
Tanks
are
usually
champions
that
combine
high
amounts
of
health,
armor,
and
magic
resistance.
If
left
alone,
tanks
are
able
to
absorb
high
amounts
of
damage
or
create
disables
on
their
foes,
which
make
them
great
harassers
as
well.
In
battle,
this
type
of
champion
is
usually
expected
to
start/initiate
(or
at
least
be
in
the
front
of)
the
team
fight
;
soaking
up
damage,
and
helping
focus
certain
enemies
(marksman
and
mage
champions).
Due
to
their
low
damage
output,
they
must
rely
on
their
assassin,
marksman,
fighter,
and
mage
champions
to
finish
the
enemy
off
or
chase
them
down
when
they
initially
weakened
them.
As
a
result,
tanks
are
not
expected
to
gain
high
kills
but
more
assists.
Tank
champions
should
coordinate
team
fights
by
telling
the
team
to
retreat
or
advance
when
necessary
since
they
lead
the
charge.
They
are
also
meant
to
be
a
protector
of
the
team,
and
must
be
willing
to
sacrifice
themselves
for
vulnerable
allies
if
necessary.
Tanks
can
usually
kill
mages,
as
a
mage's
full
burst
will
rarely
take
the
tank
below
50%
health,
and
are
left
open
for
the
tank's
slow,
steady
damage
output;
however,
DoT
mages
might
be
harder
to
deal
with.
Some
tanks
have
very
high
ratios
on
their
abilities
and
if
they
are
doing
well
enough
they
can
leave
a
bit
their
tankiness
to
get
damage.
In
a
manner
similar
to
many
supports,
most
tanks
can
use
CC
to
interrupt
assasins,
but
they
can
also
use
them
to
lock
down
mages
or
marksmen
using
their
defenses
to
be
able
to
safely
position
themselves
within
the
enemy
lines.
Secondary
Attributes
Jungler
:
Champions
that
can
easily
farm
monsters
in
the
jungle
at
an
early
stage
in
the
game
and
can
typically
take
out
minions
waves
quickly.
They
usually
excel
at
taking
down
opponents
when
they
can
catch
them
off
guard
in
lane.
Some
champions
jungle
because
their
lane
phase
isn't
that
strong
(easily
harassed,
high
mana
dependency
early
on)
and
others
are
capable
of
both.
Many
fighters,
assassins
and
tanks
can
take
the
role
of
jungler;
though
it
is
generally
expected
that
the
champion
will
have
some
form
of
self
sustain
.
Melee
:
Champions
that
have
a
melee
basic
attack,
so
they
have
to
be
very
close
to
their
target
in
order
to
do
damage.
They
usually
have
more
health,
armor
and
magic
resistance
than
ranged
champions
as
well
as
heals.
Most
tanks
and
fighters
are
melee
combatants,
although
melee
mages
are
not
uncommon.
Pusher
:
Champions
that
can
quickly
kill
minion
waves
or
destroy
turrets
in
a
short
amount
of
time.
Typically,
pusher
champions
have
pets,
AoE
abilities,
or
a
high
amount
of
attack
speed.
Ranged
:
Champions
whose
basic
attack
can
cause
damage
at
a
distance
(see
range
),
allowing
them
to
avoid
many
harmful
risks
and
increasing
their
flee
capability.
Ranged
Champions
are
divided
into
two
sub-categories:
Mage
and
Marksmen
champions.
Mages
have
a
weak
auto-attack
and
focus
on
high
damage
spells
or
support,
while
marksmen
tend
to
focus
more
on
frequent,
powerful
auto-attacks.
Recommended
:
Champions
whose
skills
don't
involve
any
complicated
mechanics
and
playing
them
effectively
does
not
require
extensive
knowledge
of
the
other
champions.
They
are
all
1350
or
lower,
with
the
exception
of
Sona
,
Rammus
and
Katarina
,
who
cost
3150
.
There
is
usually
at
least
1
recommended
champion
every
free
week.
Stealth
:
Champions
that
possess
at
least
one
ability
that
allows
them
to
become
invisible
to
enemies
(other
than
when
near
turrets
and
vision
wards).
This
attribute
is
mainly
for
assassin
champions.

 Hello and welcome to my latest [Guide] post. Im just your friendly neighborhood Gold player that wants to impart some knowledge about general League knowledge through tips, tricks and experience to hopefully help you or maybe a friend of yours through your games. This guide will be on the general role and actions taken by the Assassin Role . 
 
 Would you like to decide what [Guide] comes next? Well you can! Poll Below! 
 
 Under level 30? Happy to have you! Im impressed youre already looking through the forums. Take a look at my League Basics guide if you want a lighter (and much shorter) list of basic skills to learn, in-game terms, etc. 
 Dont like my guides? While I am trying my best I completely understand if you would like something else, so why not try the guides I started from myself at Mobafire.com ? But please be sure to tell me what I can improve on before you go! :) 
 
 1) Assassin? 
 2) Who is an Assassin? 
 3) What do? 
 4) Summoner Spells 
 5) Runes/Masteries 
 6) Champ Select 
 --- Stealth vs. Mobility --- Damage vs. Mobility --- Considering the enemy team 
 7) Laning Phase 
 --- Combos --- When to roam --- When to go back --- Cooldowns 
 8) Teamfights 
 --- High Priority Targets --- E.T.K. Estimated Time to Kill --- Exit Strategy 
 9) Items 
 10) Tips and Tricks 
 
 
 1. 
 Assassin? 
 
 Assassin are champions that specialize in ambush, surprise, hit + runs, and trickery to do as much make an enemy disappear as quickly as they do after. Some are good for teamfights and others specifically avoid them, but either way assassins thrive on attacking backlines and killing out of position victims and getting away safely. 
 Assassins are found in top lane, mid lane and jungle. Mid-lane most commonly for reliable leveling and easy access to roaming. 
 
 2. 
 Who? 
 
 While still considered part of the Burst Caster category (as explained here ) Assassins are a unique brand of caster that are more geared to single targets rather than AoE. Please note, however, that there are a lot of Burst Casters that can mimic Assassins if given enough of a lead or other hyperbolized cases. If you feel Im missing someone you truly feel is commonly recognized to be primarily an Assassin dont hesitate to call me out on it! 
 
 Stealth Defined 
     Short and sweet, these buggers can be invisible. As a gap closer, this can be remarkably effective as the counter-play to stealth is not only limited but very ironically visible. These champions use this (particularly early game) so they can engage on their terms, almost entirely when they have the advantage. Whether this is to sneak up during a fight, or hunt around to start one, stealth champions can snowball pretty heavily as they have a very safe entrance and/or exit strategy. i.e. you cant cc what you cant see. 
 Mobility Defined 
         These champions are known for dashing. Left, right, up, down, over walls and under turrets. Their gap closers are their best strength and if used right can literally jump circles around enemies. While cc inhibits them greatly, any single target usually doesnt pack enough cc to get them away for long. This makes them very good for pick comps and 1v1 dueling. 
 
 
 3. 
 What do? 
 
 Go in. Delete someone. Get out. Repeat ASAP. 
 Kill em dead! 
 Theoretically assassins are very simple. And their kits make this quite apparent, with the number of dashes, stealth mechanics and other form of distance closers they are tailored to get to whoever they so choose. Mechanically, however, assassins can be one of the hardest roles . Assassins punish mistakes, out of position players, a gap in the frontline, a baited cooldown, even a teamfight that happens elsewhere. The higher you go in rank the less mistakes that are made, and the few that are made have an insanely short window of ideal opportunity, or may even be a bait! As such, an Assassin needs to have sharp reflexes and even sharper awareness. There are a few tips here to help you on that venture later! Now, that being said, the reverse also holds true. The lower rank you go the more mistakes are made by an average player. Because of that Assassins can seem massively overtuned (OP), because their ideal use cases pop up so often comparatively. Anyone who has had a LeBlanc or Evelynn rampage through a bronze ranked match can testify to this. The reason I mention this is to specifically warn Assassin mains about exponential difficulty increase as they go up in rank . They can still do well, dont get me wrong, but just keep in mind your roles effectiveness is just as dependent on your opponents skill as how well you play yourself. 
 Assassins are there to punish mistakes made by the enemy as harshly as possible. With the intention of taking a player out and creating an advantage for their team. 
 
 4. 
 Spells 
 
 Spell #1 
  Flash 
 So versatile its downright necessary. If you have access to this spell you can never go wrong in packing it with you. It can be used as an escape, yet another gap closer in your arsenal or any number of other clever uses. 
 Possible Alternatives: (VERY rarely) 
 Spell #2 
  Ignite 
 This spell is good for its healing reduction and for its capacity to secure a kill. With the recent change to Heal the aforementioned strength of healing reduction is less effective, so this will largely be more effective on Assassins with resets more than anyone else. It can secure a kill and consequently be the difference between an escape or even a Pentakill. 
  Barrier 
 This is a good all-around choice, as your laning opponent will have a lot of burst and your role in teamfights will put you in danger of being focused by multiple people. This can be used very effectively to survive the initiate. 
  Smite 
 Only if youre jungling! 
 Possible Alternatives:  
 
 5. 
 Runes/Masteries 
 
 Lets focus on the stats that will give you the best early game based on the situation. 
 Offensive Stats 
 
 Cooldown Reduction 
 Do you do better of you have spells up a second or two earlier? Does your normal (core) build leave room (&amp;lt;40%) for more CDR? If so, try out cooldown reduction runes and masteries. Careful though, this can affect your resource management negatively. 
 Ability Power/Attack Damage 
 These are best in marks and quintessences. This will always be useful to have. I suggest getting Flat AP/AD runes, as that will give you the most noticeable bonus level 1-3. Beyond that items will dilute the bonus of per level runes. Either is still useful however. 
 ArmorPen/SpellPen/HybridPen 
 Your respective mitigation pierce can be very important, as that will be the first (cheapest) itemization counter to your burst. But keep in mind who you are going to be damaging. Note what kind of damage your champ of choices kit does though, some can be deceiving. Akalis E, for example, deals physical damage but scales with AP as well as AD. 
 
 Defensive Stats 
 
 Lifesteal/SpellVamp 
 Situational. If youre playing well and are bursty enough this isnt a useful stat most of the time, as fights will be decided within seconds and this increases your extended staying power. Some Assassins play an exception, though and benefit from extended engages (i.e. Akali, Katarina). In those cases LS/SV can be very helpful.  
 Magic Resist/Armor 
 Depends on location. Assassin jungles use armor very effectively as it keeps their health up during their early jungle clear, and mid assassins will use MR well as they will usually be going against a mage and their trades will be more favorable. Personally, I suggest per level mitigation either way however, as Assassins do not end up itemizing mitigation outside of situational buys (i.e. Maw, Abyssal), and this may be your only source besides base stats. 
 Health 
 To be completely honest, I have not messed with health runes at all and health masteries rarely. The same argument for armor/MR can be had for it and it can help, but mitigation goes farther in small bonuses than health almost always. So while I am putting it here as an option because Ive seen it work rarely I personally suggest against it. 
 Regen 
 Flat regen bonuses to mana and health can help out your laning, as well as help out learning to manage a specific champions kit in trading. You may even find you prefer this stat over mitigation or inefficient offensive stats after enough games, but it will largely fall down to personal playstyle. Do you trade often or rarely? Do you have enough downtime in your games to use this stat well? (Jungle assassins can use health regen well) 
 Special note: Energy runes are never worth it. The numbers are simply not good enough and it is not worth the hyper-specific rune page.

 Champ Select 
 
 No matter how good you are mechanically, strategy and pick decisions can still affect your own capacity to do well. But you only have a short amount of time to consider what you can do, what the enemy team can do against you and you can in turn work around that. So to simplify things, lets divide this up to three general areas to consider. 
 --- Stealth vs. Mobility 
 What do you as a player find yourself liking to use? There are simply more options for mobility based assassins and it is more versatile, but both mobility and stealth mechanics have their respective strengths. 
 Stealth abuses out of position targets and has the primary perk of not only being able to choose where to appear but when to as well. This lets you plan and react to an enemys actions much better. Essentially the same way waiting in an unwarded bush waiting for a hapless victim almost guarantees a won fight. Except here you can bring a bush around with you. Ironically it does have some very visible counters, like upgraded red trink, abilities like Lee Sin E, and traps. 
 Mobility has its chief strength as its chief weakness as well. Its very versatile and will always be useful, and as such its hard to know when to best use it. Stealth has a very easy to see use case but mobility is comparatively easier to bait and infinitely easier to regret. However, it has much less clear and easily used counters. Mobility is both easier to use and harder to truly master in an assassin role for this reason. 
 --- Melee vs. Ranged 
 Level 1-3 autoattack range can really make a difference, but later effective range comes into play majorly in laning. As an example, Zed has a much higher effective range than another assassin like Fizz, solely because you can efficiently poke with his shadow without commitment. This means that Zed will be able to soften up his target much easier than Fizz, because in order for Fizz to have an exit strategy (to be discussed later) he cant move farther than his Q cast range. While a pretty specific example, I think it portrays the choice well. Both Fizz and Zed are strong Assassins with a lot of burst. But your laning experience can be very different because of how often you can poke and as such is an important factor to consider. 
 --- Considering the enemy team 
 This is heavily reliant on your personal champion knowledge, so the more champs youve played the better! Keep your eye on champions that can peel , champions that out-damage you and champions that can ignore/tank your burst . These are the champions to watch out for and as a result build and play around. Knowing what theyre kits can do and how they can affect your own performance in the upcoming game can really help out in your own decisions. 
 
 7. 
 Laning Phase 
 
 Combos 
 I suggest to always play a Co-op vs. AI game when playing a new champion, but I do this even more so for assassins because most are heavily reliant on quick reflexes and skill ordering. As an example, look at Katarina. Her Q is where a decent amount of her damage is locked, and making sure to get that out before using her W AoE can mean the difference between a good amount of damage. Going in with that isnt too difficult, but in the chaos of a teamfight it can be a lot less reliable. As a tip, keep an eye out for specific kinds of abilities in a champions kit. Indpendents are abilities that stand by themselves and are not used within a combo often, or are there for a different purpose (utility or defensive). Essentially abilities that you can go without using and still use the given combo i.e. Evelynns W, Akali W Dependents are abilities that require a certain action to trigger the rest of its effect. These abilities should ideally only be used when another ability (or in some cases aas) can follow behind. i.e. Katarina Q, Akali Q, Zed ult. Triggers are abilities that have an obvious purpose to proc Dependents. In other words, by themselves they dont do a whole lot, but are used largely to proc the Dependent ability in question. Some can be obvious but others can be more subtle. i.e. LeBlanc E, Shaco W, Akali E 
 When to roam (assuming you are laning) 
 Before you think about this ask yourself a few questions. 
 
 Is your laning opponent backed or backing? This means when you roam your laning opponent cannot make you regret your choice by either free farming or damaging your turret. If your opponent is indeed still there, the choice to roam will have repercussions in your lane. 
 Is there an opportunity? Look around, will there be a vulnerable enemy somewhere that you can jump on? This is particularly important, as when you make your choice to roam somewhere you will want to get something out of it. 
 Are you healthy? Surprised to see this last? Dont be. Assassins excel in 1v1 and low health situations, as their kits depend on burst and reinforce a playstyle that involves simply not getting hit. So depending on your confidence level and health can you kill them before they can kill you? 
 
 Cooldowns 
 Your abilities are not only your tool to do your job, but are also the things keeping you alive. Smart players will be scared of a fed Zed or Shaco, but will be very happy to pounce on either that have just used their cooldowns. In other words your downtime is your most vulnerable window, and people will use that to their advantage. So make sure when your use your abilities they count. Whether that means simply hurting someone to the point they dont want to engage or if you want to be fancy to bait a player into your team, cooldowns are one of the most important things to keep an eye on with both playing as and against an Assassin. 
 
 8. 
 Teamfights 
 
 High Priority Targets I will find you, and I will kill you 
 As an assassin your damage is your life, and so you want to be using it on the people that will..appreciate..your damage the most. Marksman, Mages and other Assassins build and play to their frontloaded damage capability, and thus cannot afford to build much defense if they want to stay relevant. Their low health, Armor and MR should allow you to chunk and chunk well, but you have to be sure to chunk them before they can chunk you. 
 E.T.K. Estimated Time to Kill Hey look it's LeBl-- 
 Simply put, a still Assassin is a dead Assassin. If you have to stick around to kill someone after your initial burst you better pray you can kill them soon. Always factor in how long you believe it will take to kill someone once you pounce on them. In that exact moment do you think you can kill the target and get away with it quick enough? 
 Exit Strategy In and out. Quick and clean 
 If you have a reset mechanic (Khazix, Kat) the your Exit Strategy is killing someone. But for everyone else you have to factor in how you can get away from the enemy while your cooldown are blown. As I mentioned before this is your most vulnerable period. Killing everyone is a completely valid tactic if you can pull it off. 
 
 9. 
 Items 
 This section will assume you are laning. For Jungle Assassin help, please see my Jungle [Guide] 
 
 Starting Items 
 Going against another damage heavy lane? 
 
 AP: 
 AD: 
 Your best bet is to try to out damage them, while packing a bit of sustain yourself. Thats what Doran items are there for! Early laning will rely heavily on your own mechanics and plays, but as far as stats go this will probably be your best bet. Energy and resource-less champions need to be a bit more creative and reactive to who youre laning against. 
 Going against a tanky/bruiser lane? 
 Try out: or It will largely depend on your specific champion, but these can be good buys in the right situation. Flask will give your more sustain and benefits an aggressive playstyle, as every back will save you money on potions. Cloth is nice for trading with a melee Assassin, as the cloth will mitigate a lot of minion damage and ranged auto's and a tanky opponent will be fighting for sustain dominance. 
 
 High Priority Assassin items 
 Void Staff 
 
 Strong for: % MR Shred | Weak for: Dependent on opponents MR 
AP and dealing with a lot of MR? Get this item to reduce the effectiveness of all of their MR options. This item is currently good enough to be considered a staple item on burst casters (this includes Assassins) so if you find yourself getting this item often thats normal. 
 
 Last Whisper 
 
 Strong for: % armor Shred | Weak for: Dependent on opponents armor Good for any AD assassin dealing with a lot of armor. This has good synergy with an lifesteal item, as lifesteal is calculated after mitigation. 
 
 Rabadons Deathcap 
 
 Strong for: Total AP boost | Weak for: Lack of survivability Highest boost of AP in the game with its passive, Rabbys is a great end-tier item for any AP Assassin. Be careful though, it provides no defensive capability by itself. If you're not getting focused or caught often, then by all means get this, but if you're getting killed often in teamfights you may want to consider a defensive item.  
 
 Zhonyas Hourglass 
 
 Strong for: High AP/Invul Active | Weak for: Expensive $$ Easily considered a staple item on any AP Assassin, zhonya's not only builds out of a great counter-ad item, but also is one of the three 120 end-tier items. Used right, the active can both save you and give you valuable seconds towards getting your cooldowns off again. This item is useful always for an AP champion. 
 
 Deathfires Grasp 
 
 Strong for: High AP/Damage Active | Weak for: Expensive $$ The most offensive, in your face, burst them down item in the game, DFG not onl has a hard-hitting active that multiplies magic damage it is the last of the 120 AP triumvirate. Be sure to open up with the active first to multiply your entire combo if you can follow up. Even I still have trouble with proper use of the active, so don't feel bad if you whiff it, just practice! 
 
 Bloodthirster 
 
 Strong for: High AD/Lifesteal | Weak for: Stack Based/Expensive $$ If you're doing well at the beginning go ahead and rush this. Getting the stacks up is easy in laning but somewhat more difficult afterwards. Once you have them though this item gives the highest amount of AD and lifesteal for an item slot (barring Sword of the Occult). Get this item when you need both those stats and believe you won't be dying anytime soon. Not a good buy of your team is currently on the defensive.  
 
 Blade of the Ruined King 
 
 Strong for: Lifesteal/%health active | Weak for: Low AD Great item, but for Assassins it is most useful for the active. Since you do not stack health, any %health drain from a higher health target will reverse chunk you more. Keep in mind the passive on-hit is %current health, but the active is %max health. 
 
 Liandres Torment 
 
 Strong for: Flat Pen/Burn Passive/Health | Weak for: Low AP One of few options for flat spell pen, which is always a good thing as it helps against tanks and squishys alike. It also gives a nice boost to health and gives a little more power to pokes and sustained damage if youre finding yourself unable to burst in and need another avenue of contribution.  
 
 Mecurial Scimitar 
 
 Strong for: High AD/Cleanse Active | Weak for: Situational/Expensive $$ Ad-heavy but expensive enough to be somewhat underused, get this item for its cleanse active more than anything. Used right it not only will mitigate a decent amount of magic damage passively but prevent some very hard hitting effects and disables. Good against things like Malz ult, Zed ult, long stuns/taunts, ignite, and many others 
 
 Youmuus Ghostblade 
 
 Strong for: Flat Armor pen/Active | Weak for: Low AD/Telegraphing Not a common pick, but can do some decent work with its flat armor pen and cooldown reduction. The active is a bit lackluster (ideally, you wont be auto-attacking all that much) it is still definitely useful. Dont forget the item active has a relatively short cooldown compared to others (45 seconds). Be cautious though, activating the item can tip your enemies off that youre about to dive. 
 
 Abyssal Scepter 
 
 Strong for: Viable MR source/Flat MR reduction | Weak for: Short effect range, low AP A good defensive pick of you find yourself needing it, as well as a great offensive pick if you are playing a mobile AP Assassin like Katarina or Akali. Get this item if you are getting bursted consistently by magic damage but still think you can dive effectively. 
 
 Maw of Malmortious 
 
 Strong for: Viable MR source/Spellshield | Weak for: Situationally effective As an Ad based Assassin Maw can be a literal lifesaver, as well as a nice source of AD based on % missing health. 
 
 Trinity Force 
 
 Strong for: Spellblade passive/Stats | Weak for: Expensive $$ Dat tons of damage! Tri-force is primarily known for its 200% spellblade passive, and thats the main selling point, but it also has the nice ms boost from phage as well as a little bit of every stat you want! This is reserved for AD assassins only, AP assassins benefit more from Lich Bane of you want a spellblade effect. 
 
 Lich Bane 
 
 Strong for: Essentially 4th spell | Weak for: Weak numbers This item is great for AP Assassins that have a large burst but long-ish cool downs as it gives another high damage source to incorporate in their rotation. In other words it gives a 4th basic (non-ult) spell. That with the MS stat it makes for a nice complement to Assassins like Fizz, who are AP but still have autos in their kit. 
 
 Hextech Gunblade 
 
 Strong for: Hybrid Damage/Active | Weak for: Hybrid Damage Hextech Gunblade is one the most expensive items in the game, and its stats are the reason. Base stats wise this thing is a monster. And its actives interaction with autos and single target spells isnt to be taken for granted either. Unfortunately it gives hybrid stats that can only be effectively used by a hybrid Assassin like Akali. 
 
 Banshee's Veil 
 
 Strong for: Combo breaker | Weak for: Enemy action dependent/situational This item is great for if you're having trouble with a Mage nuke or an enemy assassin, as it will break up their combo and force them to try again with the 45 second window. It's also something to watch out for yourself. Playing against a veil either wait for another teammate to pop the bubble with a poke ability or pop it yourself with a low cooldown spell. That way you can follow up on the now vulnerable target asap. 
 
 Guardian Angel 
 
 Strong for: Death Passive | Weak for: No Offensive Stats Whats a better defense against burst than just going ahead and dying? Seriously though, this is a 1.5 sec invul that has to be burned through in order to kill you. Just like zhonyas this invul time is precious seconds to return your cooldowns and explode with damage. In higher Elo this is a must have late game as it will save you from the dreaded 60+ sec death timer more often than not.

 Tips N Tricks 
 
 Wards! 
 
 Assassins excel at jumping on weaker and wounded targets. The easiest way to find these targets is to offensively ward . This means to ward the enemy jungle to watch for their jungler and any other enemy movement. This also allows well-aware players to track where the enemy team has their own wards so you can move around undetected. 
 
 Wraiths 
 
 If youre ever caught in a situation where your lane is pushed but no roaming opportunities come up try going for the enemy wraith camp. It will give you a bit more farm as well as hurting the enemy jungles farm. Be sure to take the big one! Thatll also help against Feral Flare jungle timebombs slightly. 
 
 Assume youre not getting blue buff 
 
 That way when you do youre pleasantly surprised! 
 
 React to you laning opponents actions 
 
 Your laning opponent start roaming? Either push your lane while hes gone or follow him . Make him regret his choice as much as you can. 
 
 Dont get cocky! 
 
 Its very easy to think youre invincible when youre doing well as an Assassin. You can 100-0 anyone you want right? Never forget that one well-placed stun or missed spell can still kill you, be happy youre doing well but dont let it get to your play! 
 
 
 Addendum 
 
 Hey guys and gals, finally cranked this one out, and I will safely say I learned a few things myself. Most notably that I am very bad at an AP assassin playstyle (largely the last hitting and trading in lane), so my 'reasearch' concludes that this is probably one of the weaker Guides I've put out. But that's where I just remind that if you want, comment below with a way for me to improve my Guide. Whether it be a new section, removing a section or calling me out on misinformation doesn't matter, constructive feedback is always appreciated!

 My next [Guide] will be my 10th! And as a special treat I'll be making this next post as a guide on The Community Beta itself . So that one will be the immediate next post and the poll below is the one for after that.

  i have one problem, i do not see any assassin all i see is fighter khazix, mind telling me how to correct that because they ruined somethings they made on him that made him him. i also feel if they didnt want his kit to be where it was when he was released, why bother making him if your just gonna wreck him? Dont downvote, ive had little to no play of khazix post nerfs, i just cant deal with &quot;oh its khazix, lets squish him&quot; -_- so much pain ive had trying to make it work for him

  This is a metter of proper comboing, in my experience the nerfs didn't kill him, but made it so he couldn't just use his Q spam to kill a target. 
 Using leap--&amp;gt;auto (for passive)--&amp;gt;spikes--&amp;gt;Q to get the most out of his damage will do a respectable amount of damage within a very short amount of time. Combined with finishing % missing health bonus on his Q, repeated use of his hard hitting passive with his ult and the fact his Q can be used again very quickly and matches with sheen's internal cooldown very well means he can burst down a lot of people in one go. His old playstyle was the same, but people did not have to use spikes or stagger auto's to burst down a carry. Just leap in and Q, someone dies, and resets allow you to continue the rampage. 
 All in all, the changed to kha did not remove his role of assassin imo, it did however, make his high moment a reward for skill and not time.

    Live Gameplay 
    Guidelines 
    
    As League of Legends continues to grow and change, we want to maintain a running dialogue on what goes into its evolution. 
 This subcommunity is focused on the live state of League of Legends. This is a den of discussion where we can openly share thoughts, ideas, feedback, analysis, and even criticisms of the live state of League of Legends. 
 Some guidelines to consider: 
 
 This is a place where due diligence is important: doing your homework before discussing live balance changes means that everyone can engage from a well-informed perspective. 
 Blatant misrepresentations of fact to make a point (or to get attention) probably won't get upvotes, but we'll reiterate here that they are also frowned upon. Draw out the real discussion and keep it constructive! 
 Change affecting your most beloved or most hated champion can be polarizing, but try not to let it cloud your voting. If a good point is made, don't downvote it just because you don't want to get nerfed. 
 Context is everything. League of Legends will constantly evolve through the seasons, so try to keep your discussions and suggestions framed in the present day. Remember this is the live game, so taking into account the state of the present is important!
