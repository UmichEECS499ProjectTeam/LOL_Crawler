 Hello and welcome to my latest [Guide] post. Im just your friendly neighborhood Gold player that wants to impart some knowledge about general League knowledge through tips, tricks and experience to hopefully help you or maybe a friend of yours through your games. This guide will be on the general role and actions taken by the Assassin Role . 
 
 Would you like to decide what [Guide] comes next? Well you can! Poll Below! 
 
 Under level 30? Happy to have you! Im impressed youre already looking through the forums. Take a look at my League Basics guide if you want a lighter (and much shorter) list of basic skills to learn, in-game terms, etc. 
 Dont like my guides? While I am trying my best I completely understand if you would like something else, so why not try the guides I started from myself at Mobafire.com ? But please be sure to tell me what I can improve on before you go! :)

 1. 
 Assassin? 
 
 Assassin are champions that specialize in ambush, surprise, hit + runs, and trickery to do as much make an enemy disappear as quickly as they do after. Some are good for teamfights and others specifically avoid them, but either way assassins thrive on attacking backlines and killing out of position victims and getting away safely. 
 Assassins are found in top lane, mid lane and jungle. Mid-lane most commonly for reliable leveling and easy access to roaming. 
 
 2. 
 Who? 
 
 While still considered part of the Burst Caster category (as explained here ) Assassins are a unique brand of caster that are more geared to single targets rather than AoE. Please note, however, that there are a lot of Burst Casters that can mimic Assassins if given enough of a lead or other hyperbolized cases. If you feel Im missing someone you truly feel is commonly recognized to be primarily an Assassin dont hesitate to call me out on it! 
 
 Stealth Defined 
     Short and sweet, these buggers can be invisible. As a gap closer, this can be remarkably effective as the counter-play to stealth is not only limited but very ironically visible. These champions use this (particularly early game) so they can engage on their terms, almost entirely when they have the advantage. Whether this is to sneak up during a fight, or hunt around to start one, stealth champions can snowball pretty heavily as they have a very safe entrance and/or exit strategy. i.e. you cant cc what you cant see. 
 Mobility Defined 
         These champions are known for dashing. Left, right, up, down, over walls and under turrets. Their gap closers are their best strength and if used right can literally jump circles around enemies. While cc inhibits them greatly, any single target usually doesnt pack enough cc to get them away for long. This makes them very good for pick comps and 1v1 dueling. 
 
 
 3. 
 What do? 
 
 Go in. Delete someone. Get out. Repeat ASAP. 
 Kill em dead! 
 Theoretically assassins are very simple. And their kits make this quite apparent, with the number of dashes, stealth mechanics and other form of distance closers they are tailored to get to whoever they so choose. Mechanically, however, assassins can be one of the hardest roles . Assassins punish mistakes, out of position players, a gap in the frontline, a baited cooldown, even a teamfight that happens elsewhere. The higher you go in rank the less mistakes that are made, and the few that are made have an insanely short window of ideal opportunity, or may even be a bait! As such, an Assassin needs to have sharp reflexes and even sharper awareness. There are a few tips here to help you on that venture later! Now, that being said, the reverse also holds true. The lower rank you go the more mistakes are made by an average player. Because of that Assassins can seem massively overtuned (OP), because their ideal use cases pop up so often comparatively. Anyone who has had a LeBlanc or Evelynn rampage through a bronze ranked match can testify to this. The reason I mention this is to specifically warn Assassin mains about exponential difficulty increase as they go up in rank . They can still do well, dont get me wrong, but just keep in mind your roles effectiveness is just as dependent on your opponents skill as how well you play yourself. 
 Assassins are there to punish mistakes made by the enemy as harshly as possible. With the intention of taking a player out and creating an advantage for their team. 
 
 4. 
 Spells 
 
 Spell #1 
  Flash 
 So versatile its downright necessary. If you have access to this spell you can never go wrong in packing it with you. It can be used as an escape, yet another gap closer in your arsenal or any number of other clever uses. 
 Possible Alternatives: (VERY rarely) 
 Spell #2 
  Ignite 
 This spell is good for its healing reduction and for its capacity to secure a kill. With the recent change to Heal the aforementioned strength of healing reduction is less effective, so this will largely be more effective on Assassins with resets more than anyone else. It can secure a kill and consequently be the difference between an escape or even a Pentakill. 
  Barrier 
 This is a good all-around choice, as your laning opponent will have a lot of burst and your role in teamfights will put you in danger of being focused by multiple people. This can be used very effectively to survive the initiate. 
  Smite 
 Only if youre jungling! 
 Possible Alternatives:  
 
 5. 
 Runes/Masteries 
 
 Lets focus on the stats that will give you the best early game based on the situation. 
 Offensive Stats 
 
 Cooldown Reduction 
 Do you do better of you have spells up a second or two earlier? Does your normal (core) build leave room (&amp;lt;40%) for more CDR? If so, try out cooldown reduction runes and masteries. Careful though, this can affect your resource management negatively. 
 Ability Power/Attack Damage 
 These are best in marks and quintessences. This will always be useful to have. I suggest getting Flat AP/AD runes, as that will give you the most noticeable bonus level 1-3. Beyond that items will dilute the bonus of per level runes. Either is still useful however. 
 ArmorPen/SpellPen/HybridPen 
 Your respective mitigation pierce can be very important, as that will be the first (cheapest) itemization counter to your burst. But keep in mind who you are going to be damaging. Note what kind of damage your champ of choices kit does though, some can be deceiving. Akalis E, for example, deals physical damage but scales with AP as well as AD. 
 
 Defensive Stats 
 
 Lifesteal/SpellVamp 
 Situational. If youre playing well and are bursty enough this isnt a useful stat most of the time, as fights will be decided within seconds and this increases your extended staying power. Some Assassins play an exception, though and benefit from extended engages (i.e. Akali, Katarina). In those cases LS/SV can be very helpful.  
 Magic Resist/Armor 
 Depends on location. Assassin jungles use armor very effectively as it keeps their health up during their early jungle clear, and mid assassins will use MR well as they will usually be going against a mage and their trades will be more favorable. Personally, I suggest per level mitigation either way however, as Assassins do not end up itemizing mitigation outside of situational buys (i.e. Maw, Abyssal), and this may be your only source besides base stats. 
 Health 
 To be completely honest, I have not messed with health runes at all and health masteries rarely. The same argument for armor/MR can be had for it and it can help, but mitigation goes farther in small bonuses than health almost always. So while I am putting it here as an option because Ive seen it work rarely I personally suggest against it. 
 Regen 
 Flat regen bonuses to mana and health can help out your laning, as well as help out learning to manage a specific champions kit in trading. You may even find you prefer this stat over mitigation or inefficient offensive stats after enough games, but it will largely fall down to personal playstyle. Do you trade often or rarely? Do you have enough downtime in your games to use this stat well? (Jungle assassins can use health regen well) 
 Special note: Energy runes are never worth it. The numbers are simply not good enough and it is not worth the hyper-specific rune page. 
 
 
 6. 
 Champ Select 
 
 No matter how good you are mechanically, strategy and pick decisions can still affect your own capacity to do well. But you only have a short amount of time to consider what you can do, what the enemy team can do against you and you can in turn work around that. So to simplify things, lets divide this up to three general areas to consider. 
 --- Stealth vs. Mobility 
 What do you as a player find yourself liking to use? There are simply more options for mobility based assassins and it is more versatile, but both mobility and stealth mechanics have their respective strengths. 
 Stealth abuses out of position targets and has the primary perk of not only being able to choose where to appear but when to as well. This lets you plan and react to an enemys actions much better. Essentially the same way waiting in an unwarded bush waiting for a hapless victim almost guarantees a won fight. Except here you can bring a bush around with you. Ironically it does have some very visible counters, like upgraded red trink, abilities like Lee Sin E, and traps. 
 Mobility has its chief strength as its chief weakness as well. Its very versatile and will always be useful, and as such its hard to know when to best use it. Stealth has a very easy to see use case but mobility is comparatively easier to bait and infinitely easier to regret. However, it has much less clear and easily used counters. Mobility is both easier to use and harder to truly master in an assassin role for this reason. 
 --- Melee vs. Ranged 
 Level 1-3 autoattack range can really make a difference, but later effective range comes into play majorly in laning. As an example, Zed has a much higher effective range than another assassin like Fizz, solely because you can efficiently poke with his shadow without commitment. This means that Zed will be able to soften up his target much easier than Fizz, because in order for Fizz to have an exit strategy (to be discussed later) he cant move farther than his Q cast range. While a pretty specific example, I think it portrays the choice well. Both Fizz and Zed are strong Assassins with a lot of burst. But your laning experience can be very different because of how often you can poke and as such is an important factor to consider. 
 --- Considering the enemy team 
 This is heavily reliant on your personal champion knowledge, so the more champs youve played the better! Keep your eye on champions that can peel , champions that out-damage you and champions that can ignore/tank your burst . These are the champions to watch out for and as a result build and play around. Knowing what theyre kits can do and how they can affect your own performance in the upcoming game can really help out in your own decisions. 
 
 7. 
 Laning Phase 
 
 Combos 
 I suggest to always play a Co-op vs. AI game when playing a new champion, but I do this even more so for assassins because most are heavily reliant on quick reflexes and skill ordering. As an example, look at Katarina. Her Q is where a decent amount of her damage is locked, and making sure to get that out before using her W AoE can mean the difference between a good amount of damage. Going in with that isnt too difficult, but in the chaos of a teamfight it can be a lot less reliable. As a tip, keep an eye out for specific kinds of abilities in a champions kit. Indpendents are abilities that stand by themselves and are not used within a combo often, or are there for a different purpose (utility or defensive). Essentially abilities that you can go without using and still use the given combo i.e. Evelynns W, Akali W Dependents are abilities that require a certain action to trigger the rest of its effect. These abilities should ideally only be used when another ability (or in some cases aas) can follow behind. i.e. Katarina Q, Akali Q, Zed ult. Triggers are abilities that have an obvious purpose to proc Dependents. In other words, by themselves they dont do a whole lot, but are used largely to proc the Dependent ability in question. Some can be obvious but others can be more subtle. i.e. LeBlanc E, Shaco W, Akali E 
 When to roam (assuming you are laning) 
 Before you think about this ask yourself a few questions. 
 
 Is your laning opponent backed or backing? This means when you roam your laning opponent cannot make you regret your choice by either free farming or damaging your turret. If your opponent is indeed still there, the choice to roam will have repercussions in your lane. 
 Is there an opportunity? Look around, will there be a vulnerable enemy somewhere that you can jump on? This is particularly important, as when you make your choice to roam somewhere you will want to get something out of it. 
 Are you healthy? Surprised to see this last? Dont be. Assassins excel in 1v1 and low health situations, as their kits depend on burst and reinforce a playstyle that involves simply not getting hit. So depending on your confidence level and health can you kill them before they can kill you? 
 
 Cooldowns 
 Your abilities are not only your tool to do your job, but are also the things keeping you alive. Smart players will be scared of a fed Zed or Shaco, but will be very happy to pounce on either that have just used their cooldowns. In other words your downtime is your most vulnerable window, and people will use that to their advantage. So make sure when your use your abilities they count. Whether that means simply hurting someone to the point they dont want to engage or if you want to be fancy to bait a player into your team, cooldowns are one of the most important things to keep an eye on with both playing as and against an Assassin.

 Teamfights 
 
 High Priority Targets I will find you, and I will kill you 
 As an assassin your damage is your life, and so you want to be using it on the people that will..appreciate..your damage the most. Marksman, Mages and other Assassins build and play to their frontloaded damage capability, and thus cannot afford to build much defense if they want to stay relevant. Their low health, Armor and MR should allow you to chunk and chunk well, but you have to be sure to chunk them before they can chunk you. 
 E.T.K. Estimated Time to Kill Hey look it's LeBl-- 
 Simply put, a still Assassin is a dead Assassin. If you have to stick around to kill someone after your initial burst you better pray you can kill them soon. Always factor in how long you believe it will take to kill someone once you pounce on them. In that exact moment do you think you can kill the target and get away with it quick enough? 
 Exit Strategy In and out. Quick and clean 
 If you have a reset mechanic (Khazix, Kat) the your Exit Strategy is killing someone. But for everyone else you have to factor in how you can get away from the enemy while your cooldown are blown. As I mentioned before this is your most vulnerable period. Killing everyone is a completely valid tactic if you can pull it off.

 Items 
 This section will assume you are laning. For Jungle Assassin help, please see my Jungle [Guide] 
 
 Starting Items 
 Going against another damage heavy lane? 
 
 AP: 
 AD: 
 Your best bet is to try to out damage them, while packing a bit of sustain yourself. Thats what Doran items are there for! Early laning will rely heavily on your own mechanics and plays, but as far as stats go this will probably be your best bet. Energy and resource-less champions need to be a bit more creative and reactive to who youre laning against. 
 Going against a tanky/bruiser lane? 
 Try out: or It will largely depend on your specific champion, but these can be good buys in the right situation. Flask will give your more sustain and benefits an aggressive playstyle, as every back will save you money on potions. Cloth is nice for trading with a melee Assassin, as the cloth will mitigate a lot of minion damage and ranged auto's and a tanky opponent will be fighting for sustain dominance. 
 
 High Priority Assassin items 
 Void Staff 
 
 Strong for: % MR Shred | Weak for: Dependent on opponents MR 
AP and dealing with a lot of MR? Get this item to reduce the effectiveness of all of their MR options. This item is currently good enough to be considered a staple item on burst casters (this includes Assassins) so if you find yourself getting this item often thats normal. 
 
 Last Whisper 
 
 Strong for: % armor Shred | Weak for: Dependent on opponents armor Good for any AD assassin dealing with a lot of armor. This has good synergy with an lifesteal item, as lifesteal is calculated after mitigation. 
 
 Rabadons Deathcap 
 
 Strong for: Total AP boost | Weak for: Lack of survivability Highest boost of AP in the game with its passive, Rabbys is a great end-tier item for any AP Assassin. Be careful though, it provides no defensive capability by itself. If you're not getting focused or caught often, then by all means get this, but if you're getting killed often in teamfights you may want to consider a defensive item.  
 
 Zhonyas Hourglass 
 
 Strong for: High AP/Invul Active | Weak for: Expensive $$ Easily considered a staple item on any AP Assassin, zhonya's not only builds out of a great counter-ad item, but also is one of the three 120 end-tier items. Used right, the active can both save you and give you valuable seconds towards getting your cooldowns off again. This item is useful always for an AP champion. 
 
 Deathfires Grasp 
 
 Strong for: High AP/Damage Active | Weak for: Expensive $$ The most offensive, in your face, burst them down item in the game, DFG not onl has a hard-hitting active that multiplies magic damage it is the last of the 120 AP triumvirate. Be sure to open up with the active first to multiply your entire combo if you can follow up. Even I still have trouble with proper use of the active, so don't feel bad if you whiff it, just practice! 
 
 Bloodthirster 
 
 Strong for: High AD/Lifesteal | Weak for: Stack Based/Expensive $$ If you're doing well at the beginning go ahead and rush this. Getting the stacks up is easy in laning but somewhat more difficult afterwards. Once you have them though this item gives the highest amount of AD and lifesteal for an item slot (barring Sword of the Occult). Get this item when you need both those stats and believe you won't be dying anytime soon. Not a good buy of your team is currently on the defensive.  
 
 Blade of the Ruined King 
 
 Strong for: Lifesteal/%health active | Weak for: Low AD Great item, but for Assassins it is most useful for the active. Since you do not stack health, any %health drain from a higher health target will reverse chunk you more. Keep in mind the passive on-hit is %current health, but the active is %max health. 
 
 Liandres Torment 
 
 Strong for: Flat Pen/Burn Passive/Health | Weak for: Low AP One of few options for flat spell pen, which is always a good thing as it helps against tanks and squishys alike. It also gives a nice boost to health and gives a little more power to pokes and sustained damage if youre finding yourself unable to burst in and need another avenue of contribution.  
 
 Mecurial Scimitar 
 
 Strong for: High AD/Cleanse Active | Weak for: Situational/Expensive $$ Ad-heavy but expensive enough to be somewhat underused, get this item for its cleanse active more than anything. Used right it not only will mitigate a decent amount of magic damage passively but prevent some very hard hitting effects and disables. Good against things like Malz ult, Zed ult, long stuns/taunts, ignite, and many others 
 
 Youmuus Ghostblade 
 
 Strong for: Flat Armor pen/Active | Weak for: Low AD/Telegraphing Not a common pick, but can do some decent work with its flat armor pen and cooldown reduction. The active is a bit lackluster (ideally, you wont be auto-attacking all that much) it is still definitely useful. Dont forget the item active has a relatively short cooldown compared to others (45 seconds). Be cautious though, activating the item can tip your enemies off that youre about to dive. 
 
 Abyssal Scepter 
 
 Strong for: Viable MR source/Flat MR reduction | Weak for: Short effect range, low AP A good defensive pick of you find yourself needing it, as well as a great offensive pick if you are playing a mobile AP Assassin like Katarina or Akali. Get this item if you are getting bursted consistently by magic damage but still think you can dive effectively. 
 
 Maw of Malmortious 
 
 Strong for: Viable MR source/Spellshield | Weak for: Situationally effective As an Ad based Assassin Maw can be a literal lifesaver, as well as a nice source of AD based on % missing health. 
 
 Trinity Force 
 
 Strong for: Spellblade passive/Stats | Weak for: Expensive $$ Dat tons of damage! Tri-force is primarily known for its 200% spellblade passive, and thats the main selling point, but it also has the nice ms boost from phage as well as a little bit of every stat you want! This is reserved for AD assassins only, AP assassins benefit more from Lich Bane of you want a spellblade effect. 
 
 Lich Bane 
 
 Strong for: Essentially 4th spell | Weak for: Weak numbers This item is great for AP Assassins that have a large burst but long-ish cool downs as it gives another high damage source to incorporate in their rotation. In other words it gives a 4th basic (non-ult) spell. That with the MS stat it makes for a nice complement to Assassins like Fizz, who are AP but still have autos in their kit. 
 
 Hextech Gunblade 
 
 Strong for: Hybrid Damage/Active | Weak for: Hybrid Damage Hextech Gunblade is one the most expensive items in the game, and its stats are the reason. Base stats wise this thing is a monster. And its actives interaction with autos and single target spells isnt to be taken for granted either. Unfortunately it gives hybrid stats that can only be effectively used by a hybrid Assassin like Akali. 
 
 Banshee's Veil 
 
 Strong for: Combo breaker | Weak for: Enemy action dependent/situational This item is great for if you're having trouble with a Mage nuke or an enemy assassin, as it will break up their combo and force them to try again with the 45 second window. It's also something to watch out for yourself. Playing against a veil either wait for another teammate to pop the bubble with a poke ability or pop it yourself with a low cooldown spell. That way you can follow up on the now vulnerable target asap. 
 
 Guardian Angel 
 
 Strong for: Death Passive | Weak for: No Offensive Stats Whats a better defense against burst than just going ahead and dying? Seriously though, this is a 1.5 sec invul that has to be burned through in order to kill you. Just like zhonyas this invul time is precious seconds to return your cooldowns and explode with damage. In higher Elo this is a must have late game as it will save you from the dreaded 60+ sec death timer more often than not.

 Tips N Tricks 
 
 Wards! 
 
 Assassins excel at jumping on weaker and wounded targets. The easiest way to find these targets is to offensively ward . This means to ward the enemy jungle to watch for their jungler and any other enemy movement. This also allows well-aware players to track where the enemy team has their own wards so you can move around undetected. 
 
 Wraiths 
 
 If youre ever caught in a situation where your lane is pushed but no roaming opportunities come up try going for the enemy wraith camp. It will give you a bit more farm as well as hurting the enemy jungles farm. Be sure to take the big one! Thatll also help against Feral Flare jungle timebombs slightly. 
 
 Assume youre not getting blue buff 
 
 That way when you do youre pleasantly surprised! 
 
 React to you laning opponents actions 
 
 Your laning opponent start roaming? Either push your lane while hes gone or follow him . Make him regret his choice as much as you can. 
 
 Dont get cocky! 
 
 Its very easy to think youre invincible when youre doing well as an Assassin. You can 100-0 anyone you want right? Never forget that one well-placed stun or missed spell can still kill you, be happy youre doing well but dont let it get to your play! 
 
 
 Addendum 
 
 Hey guys and gals, finally cranked this one out, and I will safely say I learned a few things myself. Most notably that I am very bad at an AP assassin playstyle (largely the last hitting and trading in lane), so my 'reasearch' concludes that this is probably one of the weaker Guides I've put out. But that's where I just remind that if you want, comment below with a way for me to improve my Guide. Whether it be a new section, removing a section or calling me out on misinformation doesn't matter, constructive feedback is always appreciated! 
 News! 
 My next [Guide] will be my 10th! And as a special treat I'll be making this next post as a guide on The Community Beta itself . So that one will be the immediate next post and the poll below is the one for after that. I'll be making a few special [Guide Resource] posts specifically for this CB Guide, some that may be simply fun to look at anyway so keep an eye out for them!

  i have one problem, i do not see any assassin all i see is fighter khazix, mind telling me how to correct that because they ruined somethings they made on him that made him him. i also feel if they didnt want his kit to be where it was when he was released, why bother making him if your just gonna wreck him? Dont downvote, ive had little to no play of khazix post nerfs, i just cant deal with &quot;oh its khazix, lets squish him&quot; -_- so much pain ive had trying to make it work for him

  This is a metter of proper comboing, in my experience the nerfs didn't kill him, but made it so he couldn't just use his Q spam to kill a target. 
 Using leap--&amp;gt;auto (for passive)--&amp;gt;spikes--&amp;gt;Q to get the most out of his damage will do a respectable amount of damage within a very short amount of time. Combined with finishing % missing health bonus on his Q, repeated use of his hard hitting passive with his ult and the fact his Q can be used again very quickly and matches with sheen's internal cooldown very well means he can burst down a lot of people in one go. His old playstyle was the same, but people did not have to use spikes or stagger auto's to burst down a carry. Just leap in and Q, someone dies, and resets allow you to continue the rampage. 
 All in all, the changed to kha did not remove his role of assassin imo, it did however, make his high moment a reward for skill and not time.

    Guidelines 
    
    As League of Legends continues to grow and change, we want to maintain a running dialogue on what goes into its evolution. 
 This subcommunity is focused on the live state of League of Legends. This is a den of discussion where we can openly share thoughts, ideas, feedback, analysis, and even criticisms of the live state of League of Legends. 
 Some guidelines to consider: 
 
 This is a place where due diligence is important: doing your homework before discussing live balance changes means that everyone can engage from a well-informed perspective. 
 Blatant misrepresentations of fact to make a point (or to get attention) probably won't get upvotes, but we'll reiterate here that they are also frowned upon. Draw out the real discussion and keep it constructive! 
 Change affecting your most beloved or most hated champion can be polarizing, but try not to let it cloud your voting. If a good point is made, don't downvote it just because you don't want to get nerfed. 
 Context is everything. League of Legends will constantly evolve through the seasons, so try to keep your discussions and suggestions framed in the present day. Remember this is the live game, so taking into account the state of the present is important!

Trivia
Skill
usage
Due
to
Wild
Cards
having
one
of
the
highest
non-global
non-ultimate
range
in-game,
he
can
harass
very
well.
This
makes
him
a
good
pick
for
mid
lane.
While
the
projectiles
are
slow
moving,
the
long
range
of
the
cards
often
catch
enemies
by
surprise.
Additionally,
the
projectiles,
unlike
many
skillshots
and
pokes,
will
pass
through
minions,
and
even
do
damage
as
multiple
targets
are
passed.
This
disallows
opponents
from
blocking
with
their
waves.
With
some
ability
power,
using
Red
Card
and
Wild
Cards
on
a
wave
of
minions
makes
Twisted
Fate
nearly
unrivaled
in
pushing
and
clearing
quickly.
Use
this
to
gank
other
lanes
with
Destiny
,
as
your
minions
will
be
pushed
up
to
ensure
your
turret
will
be
safe
until
you
walk
back
to
it.
You
may
also
attempt
to
Red
Card
a
minion
nearby
an
enemy
champion
to
slow
the
champion
and
set
yourself
up
for
harassing
them
with
Wild
Cards
.
Pick
a
Card
has
multiple
utilities.
Blue
Card
can
help
Twisted
Fate
stay
in
lane
longer
as
he
regains
mana
back
more
quickly.
Gold
Card
is
very
useful
when
chasing
down
an
enemy
or
when
ganking
since
it
stuns
the
enemy
it
hits.
Red
Card
can
help
Twisted
Fate
push,
farm,
gank,
or
chase
down
an
enemy
because
it
deals
splash
damage
and
slows
the
targets
hit.
The
area
of
effect
of
Red
Card
may
also
be
a
more
useful
effect
for
peeling
allies
and
kiting
enemies
than
Gold
Card
if
it
can
hit
multiple
targets,
especially
when
teams
are
fighting
in
the
tight
spaces
of
the
jungle
or
at
lower
levels
when
the
duration
of
Gold
Card
will
be
much
lower
than
the
duration
of
Red
Card
The
three
different
cards
in
Pick
a
Card
are
in
a
set
rotation.
Blue
Card
,
then
Red
Card
,
then
Gold
Card
,
and
it
repeats;
the
starting
card
may
differ
each
time
you
use
Pick
a
Card
,
but
it
will
always
follow
that
rotation.
This
rotation
is
very
important
to
allow
you
to
predict
the
time
it
will
take
for
you
to
lock
in
a
card
and
throw
it.
The
card
last
chosen
can
be
the
first
card
available
when
Pick
a
Card
is
available
again.
Despite
locking
a
specific
card,
the
ability
will
still
cycle
the
card
rotation
every
time
the
card
above
Twisted
Fate
pulsates.
Thus,
if
you
throw
the
desired
card
immediately
after
locking
it
before
it
has
a
chance
to
pulsate
again,
or
every
three
pulses
after
locking
it,
the
next
card
will
be
the
one
you
last
locked.
Even
if
you
will
not
manage
to
immediately
grab
the
exact
same
card,
counting
the
beats
after
the
card
you
chose
can
still
tip
you
off
toward
grabbing
the
same
card
again
from
the
current
card
for
the
next
time
you
activate
the
ability.
Twisted
Fate
is
relatively
fragile
(squishy)
so
make
sure
you
keep
your
distance.
Twisted
Fate
is
capable
of
repeatedly
stunning
one
opponent
(with
Gold
Card
)
or
slowing
multiple
opponents
(with
Red
Card
)
every
few
seconds,
even
more
often
with
cooldown
reduction
.
Abuse
this
while
chasing,
ganking
and
escaping
pursuers.
The
abilities
of
Twisted
Fate
may
have
low
cooldowns,
but
an
ability
power-focused
Twisted
Fate
is
nonetheless
highly
vulnerable
while
his
abilities
cooldown.
Avoid
committed
fights
against
enemies
with
a
current
health
count
that
you
can't
easily
burst
down
with
Pick
a
Card
and
Wild
Cards
,
as
AP
Twisted
Fate
will
almost
certainly
lose
to
them.
Destiny
and
Gate
can
be
used
to
quickly
backdoor
enemy
structures.
Used
in
conjunction
with
another
great
backdoor
ability,
Pick
a
Card
,
as
the
bonus
damage
is
applied
to
turrets
,
it's
pretty
difficult
for
enemies
to
defend.
Picking
Stacked
Deck
as
your
first
ability
can
lead
to
a
large
amount
of
single
target
damage,
combined
with
attack
speed
runes,
it
is
a
very
good
way
to
get
first
blood
.
However,
Gold
Card
helps
greatly,
and
so
waiting
until
you
are
level
2
can
give
you
better
chances
of
a
kill.
Map
awareness
is
key
to
proper
use
of
Destiny
.
Look
around
the
map
carefully
while
farming
or
traveling
for
potential
foes.
Be
sure
to
ping
onto
targets
just
in
case
your
allies
don't
have
the
same
map
awareness
as
you
do
when
you
plan
to
use
it!
Twisted
Fate
using
Gate
against
a
sole
target
is
unlikely
to
work
well
while
the
cooldown
of
Destiny
is
fairly
long
for
a
lot
of
the
game.
When
a
team
fight
occured
and
you
already
casted
the
Destiny
at
wrong
timing,
position
or
your
team
mates
eliminated,
it
can
be
interrupted
using
Zhonya's
Hourglass
.
It
is
generally
a
good
plan
to
have
a
card
already
chosen
by
Pick
a
Card
before
using
Destiny
,
especially
if
you're
going
to
land
close
to
your
enemy.
You
should
lock
onto
Gold
Card
and
then
activate
Destiny
and
its
secondary
effect,
Gate
,
to
gank
an
enemy.
You
can
also
use
Pick
a
Card
while
channeling
Gate
,
allowing
for
a
faster
Gate
due
to
not
having
to
spend
time
locking
onto
Gold
Card
.
Make
sure
not
to
use
Pick
a
Card
too
early
either,
as
having
your
Gold
Card
run
out
as
you
Gate
will
lead
to
embarrassment
and
likely
a
fruitless
death.
Keep
in
mind
that
Destiny
will
pop
your
enemy's
Banshee's
Veil
but
this
will
also
prevent
him/her
from
being
revealed
by
your
ultimate
(you
can
still
use
Gate
though).
Meaning
that
against
a
team
with
multiple
Veils,
you
can
use
Destiny
to
pop
their
shields
before
a
big
teamfight.
Be
warned
that
fleeing
low-health
enemies
will
likely
be
guarded
by
their
allies
that
remain
invisible
to
your
ultimate
(and
you
will
only
know
it
after
teleporting
to
kill
them
and
be
ganked
yourself).
Coordinate
with
your
allies
for
the
best
time
to
use
Destiny
to
ambush
enemies.
In
a
pinch,
try
to
either
juke
your
enemy
and
then
run
into
a
bush,
or
stun
them
with
Gold
Card
.
If
successful,
pop
your
ultimate
and
start
teleporting
away
with
Gate
.
By
the
time
the
enemy
has
a
chance
to
attack
you
again,
you
should
be
a
safe
distance
away.
This
technique
can
even
work
out
in
the
open
without
Gold
Card
if
you
wait
for
the
enemy
to
pop
all
their
crowd
control
first.
Twisted
Fate
's
primary
combo
to
harass
is
to
activate
Gold
Card
with
full
Stacked
Deck
stacks,
walk
into
attack
range
and
stun
the
enemy,
then
follow
it
up
with
Wild
Cards
and
walk
away
while
the
enemy
tries
to
dodge
the
attack.
Twisted
Fate
can
then
use
Blue
Card
to
last
hit
while
regenerating
mana
and
do
the
combo
all
over
again.
This
combo
is
not
foolproof
because
enemies
will
realize
when
Twisted
Fate
activates
Pick
a
Card
and
be
prepared
to
fall
back,
or
even
use
Twisted
Fate
's
short
autoattack-range
for
applying
the
effects
of
Pick
a
Card
to
easily
predict
where
he
will
have
to
walk
to
use
it
to
set
up
skillshots.
Stacked
Deck
gains
a
stack
for
each
autoattack
and
deals
extra
damage
on
the
fourth
hit,
but
Pick
a
Card
will
vary
this
depending
on
the
scenario.
If
Twisted
Fate
has
his
at
least
one
point
in
each
his
Pick
a
Card
and
Stacked
Deck
and
throws
a
card
modified
by
Pick
a
Card
,
different
things
may
happen.
If
Pick
a
Card
would
kill
it's
target
on
its
own,
then
the
Stacked
Deck
buff
is
not
consumed
or
given
another
stack.
If
the
attack
is
not
strong
enough
to
kill
its
target
with
only
Pick
a
Card
,
then
the
Stacked
Deck
buff
will
be
consumed,
and
deal
extra
magic
damage,
or
given
a
stack.
Build
usage
Twisted
Fate
is
mainly
built
as
an
ability
power
caster.
However,
he
can
also
be
itemized
for
either
attack
damage
or
a
hybrid
mix.
Ability
Power
If
using
an
ability
power
build,
Lich
Bane
is
a
great
choice
due
to
the
ability
power
ratios
of
Twisted
Fate
being
fairly
low
and
will
not
cause
very
much
burst
damage
on
their
own
later
in
the
game.
Additionally,
the
conjunction
with
Pick
a
Card
ensures
in
large
damage
with
one
attack.
Rabadon's
Deathcap
is
mandatory
for
Twisted
Fate
,
as
with
all
AP
mid
laners.
However,
the
passive
makes
it
more
viable
as
a
second
or
third
item,
when
other
items
have
been
purchased
and
some
AP
have
been
amassed.
Zhonya's
Hourglass
is
great
for
AP
Twisted
Fate
.
It
provides
a
significant
amount
of
ability
power
to
scale
with
Rabadon's
Deathcap
and
Lich
Bane
.
The
armor
will
likely
be
helpful
as
the
short
range
of
Pick
a
Card
makes
it
likely
Twisted
Fate
will
take
some
autoattacks
if
stunning
enemy
ranged
champions.
The
stasis
active
will
also
give
a
short
grace
period
to
wait
for
ability
cooldowns
and
to
avoid
incoming
damage.
Deathfire
Grasp
is
highly
useful
on
AP
Twisted
Fate
as
it
gives
him
an
additional
part
to
his
minuscule
burst,
which
as
mentioned
above
tends
to
decline
late
game.
Remember
to
use
the
active
at
the
beginning
of
your
combo
to
amplify
all
subsequent
magic
damage.
Twin
Shadows
is
a
commonly
purchased
item
on
Twisted
Fate
.
It
provides
magic
resist
,
ability
power
,
and
incredible
chasing
capabilities
with
its
active
and
the
movement
speed
bonus.
It
allows
catching
up
to
enemies
and
getting
in
range
for
Gold
Card
.
Nashor's
Tooth
is
also
invaluable,
as
AP,
Attack
Speed,
and
CDR
are
all
very
helpful,
and
the
passive
works
well
with
Stacked
Deck
and
Pick
a
Card
.

Countering
Twisted
Fate
is
relatively
fragile
at
early
game,
putting
an
aggressive
pressure
on
the
lane
can
make
him
underleveled
or
underfarmed.
Twisted
Fate
has
fairly
poor
sustained
damage
with
an
AP
build
-
if
you
can
get
movement-affecting
crowd
control
on
him
before
he
stuns
you
as
a
champion
with
a
greater
sustained
damage
potential,
you
may
be
able
to
turn
the
trade
in
your
favour.
As
Twisted
Fate
has
no
escapes
(besides
Gate
)
and
relies
on
either
Red
Card
or
Gold
Card
to
keep
enemies
away
from
him,
focusing
him
as
a
team
is
very
difficult
for
Twisted
Fate
to
personally
deal
with.
While
Wild
Cards
has
a
nearly
unmatched
range
that
makes
stopping
Twisted
Fate
from
farming
while
he
has
mana
to
cast
it
impossible,
you
can
harass
him
when
he
uses
Blue
Card
as
it's
limited
to
the
range
of
his
basic
attacks.
The
Wild
Cards
can
be
tricky
to
dodge
as
it
travels
in
3
lines
and
moves
a
long
distance.
Instead
of
going
back,
try
to
sidestep
the
spell.
Take
care
when
Twisted
Fate
uses
his
Pick
a
Card
.
When
he
uses
a
Red
Card
,
move
away
from
your
allies
to
avoid
getting
slowed
by
it.
When
he
uses
a
Gold
Card
,
try
to
dodge
from
him
until
the
spell
wears
off.
It's
better
to
save
your
channeled
abilities
until
Twisted
Fate
uses
his
Gold
Card
or
Pick
a
Card
.
When
you
are
under
the
effect
of
Destiny
,
be
prepared
for
a
gank
as
his
Gate
allows
him
to
teleport
to
a
huge
range
in
the
map.
Gate
has
a
noticeable
channeling
with
a
marked
location
-
this
can
leave
him
an
easy
target
for
skillshots.
If
the
skillshots
apply
crowd
control,
this
can
stop
Twisted
Fate
from
getting
you
killed
-
or
maybe
even
turn
the
gank
onto
him!
Dashes
and
blinks,
if
saved,
may
allow
you
to
avoid
Gold
Card
if
used
while
Twisted
Fate
is
teleporting
to
a
location
on
top
of
you.

Skill
usage
Due
to
Wild
Cards
having
one
of
the
highest
non-global
non-ultimate
range
in-game,
he
can
harass
very
well.
This
makes
him
a
good
pick
for
mid
lane.
While
the
projectiles
are
slow
moving,
the
long
range
of
the
cards
often
catch
enemies
by
surprise.
Additionally,
the
projectiles,
unlike
many
skillshots
and
pokes,
will
pass
through
minions,
and
even
do
damage
as
multiple
targets
are
passed.
This
disallows
opponents
from
blocking
with
their
waves.
With
some
ability
power,
using
Red
Card
and
Wild
Cards
on
a
wave
of
minions
makes
Twisted
Fate
nearly
unrivaled
in
pushing
and
clearing
quickly.
Use
this
to
gank
other
lanes
with
Destiny
,
as
your
minions
will
be
pushed
up
to
ensure
your
turret
will
be
safe
until
you
walk
back
to
it.
You
may
also
attempt
to
Red
Card
a
minion
nearby
an
enemy
champion
to
slow
the
champion
and
set
yourself
up
for
harassing
them
with
Wild
Cards
.
Pick
a
Card
has
multiple
utilities.
Blue
Card
can
help
Twisted
Fate
stay
in
lane
longer
as
he
regains
mana
back
more
quickly.
Gold
Card
is
very
useful
when
chasing
down
an
enemy
or
when
ganking
since
it
stuns
the
enemy
it
hits.
Red
Card
can
help
Twisted
Fate
push,
farm,
gank,
or
chase
down
an
enemy
because
it
deals
splash
damage
and
slows
the
targets
hit.
The
area
of
effect
of
Red
Card
may
also
be
a
more
useful
effect
for
peeling
allies
and
kiting
enemies
than
Gold
Card
if
it
can
hit
multiple
targets,
especially
when
teams
are
fighting
in
the
tight
spaces
of
the
jungle
or
at
lower
levels
when
the
duration
of
Gold
Card
will
be
much
lower
than
the
duration
of
Red
Card
The
three
different
cards
in
Pick
a
Card
are
in
a
set
rotation.
Blue
Card
,
then
Red
Card
,
then
Gold
Card
,
and
it
repeats;
the
starting
card
may
differ
each
time
you
use
Pick
a
Card
,
but
it
will
always
follow
that
rotation.
This
rotation
is
very
important
to
allow
you
to
predict
the
time
it
will
take
for
you
to
lock
in
a
card
and
throw
it.
The
card
last
chosen
can
be
the
first
card
available
when
Pick
a
Card
is
available
again.
Despite
locking
a
specific
card,
the
ability
will
still
cycle
the
card
rotation
every
time
the
card
above
Twisted
Fate
pulsates.
Thus,
if
you
throw
the
desired
card
immediately
after
locking
it
before
it
has
a
chance
to
pulsate
again,
or
every
three
pulses
after
locking
it,
the
next
card
will
be
the
one
you
last
locked.
Even
if
you
will
not
manage
to
immediately
grab
the
exact
same
card,
counting
the
beats
after
the
card
you
chose
can
still
tip
you
off
toward
grabbing
the
same
card
again
from
the
current
card
for
the
next
time
you
activate
the
ability.
Twisted
Fate
is
relatively
fragile
(squishy)
so
make
sure
you
keep
your
distance.
Twisted
Fate
is
capable
of
repeatedly
stunning
one
opponent
(with
Gold
Card
)
or
slowing
multiple
opponents
(with
Red
Card
)
every
few
seconds,
even
more
often
with
cooldown
reduction
.
Abuse
this
while
chasing,
ganking
and
escaping
pursuers.
The
abilities
of
Twisted
Fate
may
have
low
cooldowns,
but
an
ability
power-focused
Twisted
Fate
is
nonetheless
highly
vulnerable
while
his
abilities
cooldown.
Avoid
committed
fights
against
enemies
with
a
current
health
count
that
you
can't
easily
burst
down
with
Pick
a
Card
and
Wild
Cards
,
as
AP
Twisted
Fate
will
almost
certainly
lose
to
them.
Destiny
and
Gate
can
be
used
to
quickly
backdoor
enemy
structures.
Used
in
conjunction
with
another
great
backdoor
ability,
Pick
a
Card
,
as
the
bonus
damage
is
applied
to
turrets
,
it's
pretty
difficult
for
enemies
to
defend.
Picking
Stacked
Deck
as
your
first
ability
can
lead
to
a
large
amount
of
single
target
damage,
combined
with
attack
speed
runes,
it
is
a
very
good
way
to
get
first
blood
.
However,
Gold
Card
helps
greatly,
and
so
waiting
until
you
are
level
2
can
give
you
better
chances
of
a
kill.
Map
awareness
is
key
to
proper
use
of
Destiny
.
Look
around
the
map
carefully
while
farming
or
traveling
for
potential
foes.
Be
sure
to
ping
onto
targets
just
in
case
your
allies
don't
have
the
same
map
awareness
as
you
do
when
you
plan
to
use
it!
Twisted
Fate
using
Gate
against
a
sole
target
is
unlikely
to
work
well
while
the
cooldown
of
Destiny
is
fairly
long
for
a
lot
of
the
game.
When
a
team
fight
occured
and
you
already
casted
the
Destiny
at
wrong
timing,
position
or
your
team
mates
eliminated,
it
can
be
interrupted
using
Zhonya's
Hourglass
.
It
is
generally
a
good
plan
to
have
a
card
already
chosen
by
Pick
a
Card
before
using
Destiny
,
especially
if
you're
going
to
land
close
to
your
enemy.
You
should
lock
onto
Gold
Card
and
then
activate
Destiny
and
its
secondary
effect,
Gate
,
to
gank
an
enemy.
You
can
also
use
Pick
a
Card
while
channeling
Gate
,
allowing
for
a
faster
Gate
due
to
not
having
to
spend
time
locking
onto
Gold
Card
.
Make
sure
not
to
use
Pick
a
Card
too
early
either,
as
having
your
Gold
Card
run
out
as
you
Gate
will
lead
to
embarrassment
and
likely
a
fruitless
death.
Keep
in
mind
that
Destiny
will
pop
your
enemy's
Banshee's
Veil
but
this
will
also
prevent
him/her
from
being
revealed
by
your
ultimate
(you
can
still
use
Gate
though).
Meaning
that
against
a
team
with
multiple
Veils,
you
can
use
Destiny
to
pop
their
shields
before
a
big
teamfight.
Be
warned
that
fleeing
low-health
enemies
will
likely
be
guarded
by
their
allies
that
remain
invisible
to
your
ultimate
(and
you
will
only
know
it
after
teleporting
to
kill
them
and
be
ganked
yourself).
Coordinate
with
your
allies
for
the
best
time
to
use
Destiny
to
ambush
enemies.
In
a
pinch,
try
to
either
juke
your
enemy
and
then
run
into
a
bush,
or
stun
them
with
Gold
Card
.
If
successful,
pop
your
ultimate
and
start
teleporting
away
with
Gate
.
By
the
time
the
enemy
has
a
chance
to
attack
you
again,
you
should
be
a
safe
distance
away.
This
technique
can
even
work
out
in
the
open
without
Gold
Card
if
you
wait
for
the
enemy
to
pop
all
their
crowd
control
first.
Twisted
Fate
's
primary
combo
to
harass
is
to
activate
Gold
Card
with
full
Stacked
Deck
stacks,
walk
into
attack
range
and
stun
the
enemy,
then
follow
it
up
with
Wild
Cards
and
walk
away
while
the
enemy
tries
to
dodge
the
attack.
Twisted
Fate
can
then
use
Blue
Card
to
last
hit
while
regenerating
mana
and
do
the
combo
all
over
again.
This
combo
is
not
foolproof
because
enemies
will
realize
when
Twisted
Fate
activates
Pick
a
Card
and
be
prepared
to
fall
back,
or
even
use
Twisted
Fate
's
short
autoattack-range
for
applying
the
effects
of
Pick
a
Card
to
easily
predict
where
he
will
have
to
walk
to
use
it
to
set
up
skillshots.
Stacked
Deck
gains
a
stack
for
each
autoattack
and
deals
extra
damage
on
the
fourth
hit,
but
Pick
a
Card
will
vary
this
depending
on
the
scenario.
If
Twisted
Fate
has
his
at
least
one
point
in
each
his
Pick
a
Card
and
Stacked
Deck
and
throws
a
card
modified
by
Pick
a
Card
,
different
things
may
happen.
If
Pick
a
Card
would
kill
it's
target
on
its
own,
then
the
Stacked
Deck
buff
is
not
consumed
or
given
another
stack.
If
the
attack
is
not
strong
enough
to
kill
its
target
with
only
Pick
a
Card
,
then
the
Stacked
Deck
buff
will
be
consumed,
and
deal
extra
magic
damage,
or
given
a
stack.
Build
usage
Twisted
Fate
is
mainly
built
as
an
ability
power
caster.
However,
he
can
also
be
itemized
for
either
attack
damage
or
a
hybrid
mix.
Ability
Power
If
using
an
ability
power
build,
Lich
Bane
is
a
great
choice
due
to
the
ability
power
ratios
of
Twisted
Fate
being
fairly
low
and
will
not
cause
very
much
burst
damage
on
their
own
later
in
the
game.
Additionally,
the
conjunction
with
Pick
a
Card
ensures
in
large
damage
with
one
attack.
Rabadon's
Deathcap
is
mandatory
for
Twisted
Fate
,
as
with
all
AP
mid
laners.
However,
the
passive
makes
it
more
viable
as
a
second
or
third
item,
when
other
items
have
been
purchased
and
some
AP
have
been
amassed.
Zhonya's
Hourglass
is
great
for
AP
Twisted
Fate
.
It
provides
a
significant
amount
of
ability
power
to
scale
with
Rabadon's
Deathcap
and
Lich
Bane
.
The
armor
will
likely
be
helpful
as
the
short
range
of
Pick
a
Card
makes
it
likely
Twisted
Fate
will
take
some
autoattacks
if
stunning
enemy
ranged
champions.
The
stasis
active
will
also
give
a
short
grace
period
to
wait
for
ability
cooldowns
and
to
avoid
incoming
damage.
Deathfire
Grasp
is
highly
useful
on
AP
Twisted
Fate
as
it
gives
him
an
additional
part
to
his
minuscule
burst,
which
as
mentioned
above
tends
to
decline
late
game.
Remember
to
use
the
active
at
the
beginning
of
your
combo
to
amplify
all
subsequent
magic
damage.
Twin
Shadows
is
a
commonly
purchased
item
on
Twisted
Fate
.
It
provides
magic
resist
,
ability
power
,
and
incredible
chasing
capabilities
with
its
active
and
the
movement
speed
bonus.
It
allows
catching
up
to
enemies
and
getting
in
range
for
Gold
Card
.
Nashor's
Tooth
is
also
invaluable,
as
AP,
Attack
Speed,
and
CDR
are
all
very
helpful,
and
the
passive
works
well
with
Stacked
Deck
and
Pick
a
Card
.

Countering
Twisted
Fate
is
relatively
fragile
at
early
game,
putting
an
aggressive
pressure
on
the
lane
can
make
him
underleveled
or
underfarmed.
Twisted
Fate
has
fairly
poor
sustained
damage
with
an
AP
build
-
if
you
can
get
movement-affecting
crowd
control
on
him
before
he
stuns
you
as
a
champion
with
a
greater
sustained
damage
potential,
you
may
be
able
to
turn
the
trade
in
your
favour.
As
Twisted
Fate
has
no
escapes
(besides
Gate
)
and
relies
on
either
Red
Card
or
Gold
Card
to
keep
enemies
away
from
him,
focusing
him
as
a
team
is
very
difficult
for
Twisted
Fate
to
personally
deal
with.
While
Wild
Cards
has
a
nearly
unmatched
range
that
makes
stopping
Twisted
Fate
from
farming
while
he
has
mana
to
cast
it
impossible,
you
can
harass
him
when
he
uses
Blue
Card
as
it's
limited
to
the
range
of
his
basic
attacks.
The
Wild
Cards
can
be
tricky
to
dodge
as
it
travels
in
3
lines
and
moves
a
long
distance.
Instead
of
going
back,
try
to
sidestep
the
spell.
Take
care
when
Twisted
Fate
uses
his
Pick
a
Card
.
When
he
uses
a
Red
Card
,
move
away
from
your
allies
to
avoid
getting
slowed
by
it.
When
he
uses
a
Gold
Card
,
try
to
dodge
from
him
until
the
spell
wears
off.
It's
better
to
save
your
channeled
abilities
until
Twisted
Fate
uses
his
Gold
Card
or
Pick
a
Card
.
When
you
are
under
the
effect
of
Destiny
,
be
prepared
for
a
gank
as
his
Gate
allows
him
to
teleport
to
a
huge
range
in
the
map.
Gate
has
a
noticeable
channeling
with
a
marked
location
-
this
can
leave
him
an
easy
target
for
skillshots.
If
the
skillshots
apply
crowd
control,
this
can
stop
Twisted
Fate
from
getting
you
killed
-
or
maybe
even
turn
the
gank
onto
him!
Dashes
and
blinks,
if
saved,
may
allow
you
to
avoid
Gold
Card
if
used
while
Twisted
Fate
is
teleporting
to
a
location
on
top
of
you.

Jayce
Champion
Background

Skins
&amp;
Trivia
Skill
Usage
Jayce
has
a
great
variety
of
abilities
at
his
disposal.
Judicious
use
of
different
combinations
grants
him
excellent
flexibility,
able
to
adjust
for
most
situations.
If
you
are
in
your
Mercury
Hammer
form
and
need
to
quickly
relocate,
you
can
use
your
transform
into
the
Mercury
Cannon
,
giving
you
extra
movement
speed
thanks
to
your
passive
and
then
immediately
placing
Acceleration
Gate
will
give
you
a
further
significant
speed
boost.
Additionally,
casting
Acceleration
Gate
,
passing
through
it
and
then
firing
Shock
Blast
back
through
it
will
likely
deal
considerable
damage
to
your
pursuer,
forcing
him
back
or
allowing
you
to
finish
him
off
with
Hyper
Charge
and
To
the
Skies!
combo.
Also,
when
firing
Shock
Blast
through
an
Acceleration
Gate
,
the
range
and
damage
on
the
Shock
Blast
is
greatly
increased
allowing
for
high
poking
potential
in
the
laning
phase.
Placing
Jayce
within
the
Acceleration
Gate
and
casting
Shock
Blast
won't
tip
off
the
enemy
of
the
exact
line
you'll
be
firing
on
as
much
since
the
projectile
of
Shock
Blast
will
be
instantly
speed
up,
giving
them
less
time
to
better
react.
As
well,
casting
Shock
Blast
and
then
placing
Acceleration
Gate
in
its
path
can
allow
it
to
hit
an
enemy
that
wrongly
assumes
they
can
out-run
the
ability.
If
you
are
being
poked
under
your
tower,
quickly
casting
To
the
Skies!
on
a
group
of
minions
will
clear
them
and
damage
your
opponent.
While
they
are
slowed,
you
can
use
Thundering
Blow
to
knock
them
back
into
tower
range
for
a
potential
surprise
kill.
If
jungling
and
a
tower
is
being
pushed,
you
can
combo
Acceleration
Gate
and
Shock
Blast
to
quickly
clear
a
group
of
minions
and
then
Thundering
Blow
the
enemy
champion
into
the
tower
and
finish
with
To
the
Skies!
Changing
forms
introduces
an
entirely
new
set
of
abilities
that
do
not
share
the
same
cooldown
timer
with
the
other
set
of
abilities.
Changing
forms
twice
will
not
cause
an
ability
to
go
off
cooldown
any
sooner.
Hyper
Charge's
attack
damage
and
attack
speed
boost
can
affect
attacks
dealt
by
the
hammer
.
Combine
this
with
the
magic
damage
from
the
switch
and
the
leap
from
To
the
Skies!
and
finish
with
Thundering
Blow
to
deal
a
quick
and
powerful
combo.
The
magic
damage
from
the
switch
also
affects
structures.
Combined
with
the
huge
attack
speed
boost
from
his
Hyper
Charge
,
this
can
also
take
down
towers
very
quickly.
Hyper
Charge
can
be
used
to
destroy
enemy
Wards
before
they
disappear
after
they
are
placed.
Shock
Blast's
explosion
can
reveal
the
Fog
of
War
and
grant
vision
in
brush
for
a
small
period.
Thundering
Blow
has
the
capability
to
knock
enemies
over
thin
walls.
Lightning
Field
can
be
very
useful
when
trying
to
destroy
minion
waves
and
jungle
camps.
Lightning
Field's
passive
allows
easy
mana
recovery.
When

Hammer
Stance
,
To
the

makes
an
excellent
gap
closer,
and
grants
the
opportunity
to
unload
deadly
ability
combinations.
Hextech
Capacitor's
ability
to
ignore
unit
collision
and
increased
movement
speed
can
allow
great
positioning
for
singling
out
particular
enemies,
especially
when
they
are
attempting
an
escape.
When
an
enemy
is
escaping,
use
Transform:
Mercury
Hammer
to
switch
to
Hammer
Stance
.
Then,
with
the
extra
movement
speed
and
the
ability
to
ignore
unit
collision,
move
through
the
enemy
until
you
are
located
in
front
of
them.
Then
use
Thundering
Blow
to
knock
them
back.
If
they
are
too
far
away
to
catch
with
the
movespeed
alone,
To
the
Skies!
can
be
used
as
a
gap
closer,
slowing
them
and
even
further
disrupting
an
attempted
escape.
Most
of
Jayce's
abilities
do
not
interrupt
movement
or
attack
animations.
Transform:
Mercury
Cannon
,
Transform:
Mercury
Hammer
,
Lightning
Field
,
placement
of
Acceleration
Gate
,
and
the
activation
of
Hyper
Charge
do
not
interrupt
movement.
It
is
to
be
kept
in
mind
that
Jayce's
Mercury
Cannon
has
a
much
faster
attack
animation
than
his
Mercury
Hammer
.
This
makes
last
hitting
minions
much
easier
to
accomplish
while
ranged
rather
than
as
melee.
As
Acceleration
Gate
will
also
speed
up
allies
in
addition
to
yourself,
casting
it
immediately
in
your
team's
path
can
help
greatly
when
making
a
unified
retreat
or
chase
attempt.
Even
though
Thundering
Blow
does
not
scale
off
a
target's
missing
health,
it
can
be
used
as
an
execute-style
ability.
Keep
your
eye
on
the
opponent's
health
and
cast
Thundering
Blow
when
they
have
reached
the
same
%
of
their
health
as
it
will
deal
for
a
safe
kill.
Acceleration
Gate
reveals
fog
of
war
at
either
end
of
the
gate,
use
this
to
help
set
up
jumps
on
minion
camps
in
the
jungle.
While
in
lane
if
against
a
melee
champion,
be
sure
to
continually
harass
them
while
in
your
Mercury
Cannon
form,
this
will
deny
their
minion
kills
and
help
give
you
more
lane
control.
Doing
this
will
inadvertently
push
up
your
lane
so
stay
at
a
distance
once
you've
pushed
up
to
a
tower
in
order
to
allow
for
an
easy
escape
from
a
gank.
If
you
know
your
enemy
laner
is
not
present,
switch
to
your
Mercury
Hammer
and
restore
mana.
Build
Usage
Jayce
can
successfully
be
built
as
an
AD
carry
or
tanky
AD
caster
depending
on
his
team's
needs.
The
AD
caster
build
largely
focuses
on
his
Mercury
Hammer
and
his
carry
build
revolves
around
use
of
his
Mercury
Cannon
,
though
both
builds
make
use
of
both
stances.
Playing
and
building
around
Mercury
Hammer
is
generally
easier
of
the
two
as
the
transition
from
ranged
to
melee
is
an
easier
and
less-risky
one
for
a
champion
that
has
built
significant
durability
items,
while
a
transition
from
melee
to
ranged
is
obviously
beneficial
for
chasing
down
targets
or
kiting
enemies
-
and
without
durability
items,
one
is
unlikely
to
live
long
enough
to
allow
a
good
transition
from
melee
to
ranged.
Jayce
synergizes
extremely
well
with
movement
speed
items
due
to
his
many
position-dependant
abilities.
Consider
taking
items
and
spells
such
as
Boots
of
Swiftness
,
Zeal
and
Ghost
.
Trinity
Force
is
an
extremely
useful
item
for
Jayce
regardless
of
his
build,
as
he
benefits
at
least
moderately
from
all
the
stats
it
provides.
He
can
proc
its
passive
effects
regularly
as
he
will
be
making
repeated
use
of
his
spells
and
autoattacks
in
combat.
Building
an
early
Sheen
transforms
Jayce
into
a
deadly
pusher;
his
Lightning
Field
and
Shock
Blast
make
farming
minion
waves
exceptionally
easy
and
the
Sheen
procs
from
his
Transform:
Mercury
Hammer
and
Hyper
Charge
will
do
heavy
damage
to
turrets
.
Stacking
attack
speed
on
Jayce
can
be
largely
redundant
as
he
already
has
a
powerful
attack
speed
steroid
in
the
form
of
his
Hyper
Charge
.
Focusing
instead
on
attack
damage
items
can
be
more
beneficial
on
him.
Because
of
the
passive
mana
recovery
on
his
Lightning
Field
,
Jayce
is
more
restricted
by
his
health
than
by
his
mana
in
the
laning
phase.
Building
some
early
health
regeneration
or
life
steal
with
items
such
as
a
Rejuvenation
Bead
or
Vampiric
Scepter
can
allow
Jayce
to
stay
in
a
lane
for
a
very
long
time,
provided
you
can
afford
to
push
the
lane
by
hitting
creeps.
Offensively,
most
of
Jayce's
damage
is
on
the
physical
side,
making
armor
penetration
items
such
as
The
Brutalizer
and
Last
Whisper
very
effective
on
him.
The
Black
Cleaver
is
a
very
strong
item
for
Jayce
when
combined
with
his
Hyper
Charge
and
Transform:
Mercury
Cannon
,
as
he
can
very
quickly
get
all
three
reduction
stacks
on
an
opponent
and
cut
a
very
significant
portion
of
their
armor
away.
Frozen
Mallet
combines
well
with
Jayce's
exceptional
chasing
abilities
by
slowing
the
opponent
and
making
it
extremely
difficult
to
escape
from
him.
It
also
grants
a
large
amount
of
health
,
letting
him
stay
in
a
fight
for
much
longer.
Cooldown
reduction
can
be
a
useful
stat
to
itemize
for
on
Jayce
because
of
the
utility
and
damage
his
spells
afford
him.
The
active
effect
of
Talisman
of
Ascension
stacks
well
with
the
team-wide
movement
speed
boost
his
Acceleration
Gate
gives,
allowing
Jayce
and
his
team
to
relocate
extremely
rapidly
in
an
emergency.
Another
great
CDR
item
on
Jayce
is
Iceborn
Gauntlet
.
Although
it
gives
only
10
AD
when
combined
with
Manamune
/
Muramana
,
its
AoE
synergizes
very
well
with
To
the
Skies!
which
gives
him
great
wave
clearing.
This
is
a
great
build
against
an
physical
damage
-heavy
team
as
it
gives
70
armor
.
Once
he
has
obtained
at
least
17%
cooldown
reduction,
Jayce
is
capable
of
permanently
maintaining
all
eight
stacks
of
Guinsoo's
Rageblade
outside
of
combat,
as
his
Transform:
Mercury
Hammer
and
Transform:
Mercury
Cannon
are
both
free
to
cast.
Against
a
magic
damage-heavy
team,
Jayce
can
opt
to
use
either
a
Maw
of
Malmortius
or
Wit's
End
as
sources
of
AD-focused
magic
resistance
.
A
Maw
of
Malmortius
arguably
benefits
him
more
because
of
Hyper
Charge's
attack
speed
steroid
and
superior
attack
damage
scaling,
but
by
the
same
token
Hyper
Charge
can
also
let
him
very
quickly
build
the
passive
stacks
on
Wit's
End
and
offers
higher
magic
resistance.
Infinity
Edge
is
an
extremely
powerful
item
on
Jayce
when
using
Hyper
Charge
at
max
rank,
as
the
enhanced
attacks
can
critically
strike
.
With
an
Infinity
Edge
critical
hits
will
deal
250%
of
his
damage,
and
with
a
max
ranked
Hyper
Charge
,
the
enhanced
attacks
stack
with
critical
strikes
multiplicatively.
This
can
ultimately
result
in
up
to
three
critical
hits
doing
325%
damage.
Manamune
is
a
great
item
on
Jayce.
An
early
Tear
of
the
Goddess
allows
for
longer
sustain
in
lane
and
the
toggle
from
Muramana
procs
on
Thundering
Blow
and
all
three
attacks
of
Hyper
Charge
.
Sword
of
the
Divine
in
combination
with
Infinity
Edge
can
greatly
increase
the
damage
of
Hyper
Charge
.
At
400
AD,
Hyper
Charge
would
then
deal
4000
damage.

Countering
Jayce
is
highly
vulnerable
to
ranged
harass
in
lane
due
to
his
short
autoattack
range
of
500
in
cannon
form
,
and
most
ranged
attackers
can
reliably
hit
him
without
fear
of
return
fire
and
Jayce
cannot
benefit
from
the
mana-gain-per-hit
passive
of
Lightning
Field
without
taking
ranged
harass
should
he
run
out
of
mana
while
in
cannon
form
.
Consider
good
poking
top
laners
such
as
Kayle
or
Kennen
to
take
advantage
of
this.
Although
his
poke
in
the
form
of
Shock
Blast
is
highly
damaging,
the
projectile
from
this
ability
is
slow
and
relatively
easy
to
dodge.
He
can
enhance
the
attack
using
his
Acceleration
Gate
,
but
this
makes
his
attack
telegraphed,
and
lets
you
possibly
enact
countermeasures
to
it.
You
can
also
simply
remain
behind
minions
to
block
the
shots.
However,
an
accelerated
Shock
Blast
has
an
AoE
effect
that
can
damage
you
through
a
line
of
minions.
Despite
his
good
mobility,
Jayce
only
has
one
hard
gap
closer
in
the
form
of
To
the
Skies!
.
Strong
slows
like
Nasus's
Wither
can
enormously
reduce
his
effectiveness
in
combat.
To
the
Skies!
,
even
though
it
is
a
targetted
ability,
does
not
actually
track
enemies
who
are
moving.
A
blink
or
dash
ability
used
while
he
is
in
flight
can
dodge
his
attack
and
avoid
his
slow.
You
should
try
to
save
these
escapes
for
when
he
is
about
to
use
it.
Most
of
Jayce's
damage
is
physical.
Buying
early
armor
can
help
in
mitigating
his
damage.
Stacking
health
against
Jayce
is
less
effective
as
his
Thundering
Blow
deals
a
large
amount
of
magic
damage
based
on
your
maximum
health.
When
on
the
run
from
Jayce
and
his
team,
you
can
attempt
unusual
juking
maneuvers
in
order
to
mess
up
his
attempts
to
use
Thundering
Blow
to
knock
you
back
towards
his
team.
You
may
need
different
strategies
to
deal
with
Jayce
depending
on
how
he
is
playing.
Jayce's
ability
to
disrupt
a
team
as
a
bruiser
relies
on
the
abilities
of
his
Transform:
Mercury
Hammer
and
he
must
be
in
close
range
to
do
this.
Knockback
abilities
like
Tristana's
Buster
Shot
and
Alistar's
Headbutt
can
quickly
remove
the
threat
he
poses
from
a
teamfight.
Carry
Jayce
can
put
out
considerable
damage
with
his
abilities
in
Transform:
Mercury
Cannon
form,
but
the
short
range
on
his
autoattacks
means
he
must
remain
close
to
the
front
of
a
battle
to
make
the
most
of
his
kit.
This
means
he
is
highly
vulnerable
to
attack
from
tanky
champions
such
as
Irelia
or
assassins
like
Akali
.
Even
better,
pulls
such
as
Blitzcrank's
Rocket
Grab
and
Nautilus's
Dredge
Line
when
pulled
off
can
yank
him
into
range
of
your
entire
team
and
quickly
burst
him
down
before
he
can
dish
out
significant
damage.
Jayce
can
use
To
the
Skies!
to
cross
walls
and
provide
a
surprise
attack.
Both
denying
him
vision
of
key
bushes
by
destroying
any
wards
placed
there
and
warding
yourself
to
keep
track
of
his
movements
will
prevent
him
from
abusing
this.
Since
Jayce
is
not
very
sustainable,
champions
such
as
Cho'Gath
,
AP
Nidalee
,
and
Dr.
Mundo
would
be
able
to
out-sustain
Jayce
if
they
keep
successfully
harassing
him.
Building
items
such
as
Chain
Vest
,
Philosopher's
Stone
and
starting
with
a
Cloth
Armor
and
5
Health
Potion
s
can
help
out-sustain
Jayce
.

Trivia
Skill
usage
Sometimes
it
is
better
to
stand
still
and
go
into
Camouflage
for
an
escape
mechanism
than
to
use
Move
Quick
or
Recall
.
Unlike
other
stealth
abilities,
Teemo
loses
Camouflage
if
knocked
up.
When
playing
Teemo
not
in
mid
lane,
an
easy
way
to
get
First
Blood
is
to
use
Camouflage
just
out
of
range
of
their
turrets'
sight
or
at
the
edge
of
the
bush
closest
to
their
turret,
and
wait
for
the
enemy
champion
to
start
farming.
When
they
move
about
right
next
to
you,
Ignite
and
kill
them
with
the
help
of
the
mid
lane
champion
if
necessary.
Exhaust
would
be
useful
with
this
strategy.
Blinding
Dart
can
be
used
to
harass
effectively
and
can
help
Teemo
kill
physical
champions
in
fights.
Blinding
Dart
with
Exhaust
can
destroy
a
champion
who
relies
heavily
on
physical
attacks
like
Tryndamere
or
Caitlyn
.
Apply
blind
first
then
apply
Exhaust
after
the
blind
has
worn
off.
This
will
allow
your
blind
CD
to
refresh
while
your
enemy
is
exhausted,
minimizing
their
DPS.
If
you
use
both
at
the
same
time,
the
blind
will
override
the
attack
damage/ability
power
reduction.
Similarly,
you
can
use
these
two
abilities
on
two
champions,
effectively
taking
them
out
of
the
battle
for
a
few
seconds.
Blinding
Dart
can
be
used
in-between
autoattacks,
which
allows
2
rapid-fire
attacks.
This
is
extremely
important
to
learn
how
to
use
throughout
the
game.
Opening
with
a
normal
attack,
immediately
using
Blinding
Dart
,
then
proceeding
to
autoattack
will
apply
great
burst
damage,
even
during
laning.
Try
mastering
this
combo
to
use
it
on
the
fly
and
you'll
increase
your
ability
power/attack
speed
damage
tremendously.
If
Blinding
Dart
is
used
on
Fiora
before
she
activates
her
ult
Blade
Waltz
it
will
stop
the
damage
from
the
attacks
but
the
on-hit
affects
will
still
apply,
this
will
dramatically
decrease
the
damage
taken.
This
also
applies
to
Warwick's
Infinite
Duress
.
Use
Move
Quick
to
get
back
to
lane
quicker.
Move
Quick
can
also
be
used
to
get
from
lane
to
lane
very
quickly,
allowing
you
to
help
out
in
fights
all
over
the
map.
Using
Ignite
with
your
poison
can
ensure
kills
on
fleeing
enemies.
One
strategy
is
to
place
some
Noxious
Trap
in
your
lane
and
wait
for
the
enemy
to
push.
After
this,
go
into
Camouflage
.
Then,
after
the
enemy
runs
into
a
couple
of
Noxious
Traps
,
use
Blinding
Dart
and
auto
attacks
to
finish
them.
Placing
a
Noxious
Trap
or
two
behind
the
first
turret
and
before
the
2nd
near
the
paths
to
the
jungle
but
not
in
the
minions'
path
can
turn
an
almost
kill
into
an
easy
kill.
Teemo's
Noxious
Trap
can
be
used
to
farm
creep
waves
very
effectively;
it
is
best
to
keep
your
mushrooms
spread
out
and
not
too
close
to
each
other.
If
a
lane
has
enemy
minions
stacking
on
each
other
(especially
the
ranged
minions),
pop
a
Noxious
Trap
down
in
the
middle
of
them
and
watch
them
all
die
in
just
a
few
seconds.
Use
this
only
if
you
need
to
stop
a
wave
immediately
or
stop
future
waves,
because
it
is
necessary
to
maximize
potential
damage
by
increasing
the
number
of
active
shrooms
on
the
map
to
win.
More
shrooms
=
more
chances
of
hitting
them
=
more
net
damage.
Put
a
Noxious
Trap
at
key
locations
on
the
map,
such
as
by
the
Dragon
or
Baron
Nashor
to
reveal
when
your
enemies
might
be
attempting
to
kill
them
or
to
prevent
ganking
and
make
counter
ganks.
This
is
similar
to
a
Sight
Ward
but
the
range
that
Noxious
Trap
reveals
is
much
smaller.
(Tip:
Place
2.
One
near
the
opening
and
one
behind
the
monster.
The
front
one
will
explode
after
an
enemy
steps
on
it,
thwarting
them
from
starting
Baron
or
dragon,
while
the
back
one
will
allow
you
to
see
the
health
of
the
monster
and
whether
it
is
being
attacked)
Depending
on
the
enemy
teams
melee/range
makeup,
you
can
put
a
Noxious
Trap
to
the
side
of
Baron
Nashor
to
reveal
1
or
2
enemy
melee
champions,
or
you
can
place
them
a
little
behind
the
side
of
the
baron
if
there
are
3
or
more.
This
will
usually
reveal
enemy
melee
champions
currently
attempting
to
slay
Baron
Nashor
.
Put
a
Noxious
Trap
inside
brushes
and
entrances
to
your
lanes
or
your
team's
side
of
the
map
to
ensure
maximum
safety.
When
fighting
against
a
Twisted
Fate
,
be
careful
because
if
he
uses
Destiny
any
Noxious
Traps
near
any
ally
will
be
revealed.
When
laying
down
Noxious
Traps
in
the
jungle,
keep
in
mind
that
the
champion
movement
pathing
often
hugs
the
terrain
as
they
take
the
shortest
route
to
the
selected
location.
Laying
traps
against
walls
at
turning
points
will
increase
the
chance
enemies
will
run
into
them
on
their
way
to/from
lanes.
Placing
down
shrooms
in
the
center
will
allow
for
a
more
permanent
ward
(sometimes).
Also,
when
laying
traps
in
a
lane,
remember
that
minions
travel
through
the
middle,
and
if
the
front
minion
runs
into
it
only
he
and
one
minion
behind
him
will
be
hit.
Placing
them
on
the
sides
can
increase
the
chances
of
hitting
a
champion.
Placing
two
to
three
Noxious
Traps
by
the
enemy
red
or
blue
buff
is
generally
a
good
idea
considering
you
might
just
get
lucky
and
steal
it
from
them
while
slowing
their
farming
down.
It's
sometimes
a
good
idea
to
place
a
few
Noxious
Traps
behind
you
before
entering
a
teamfight,
that
way
if
you
begin
to
lose,
your
team
can
run
off
and
lead
the
enemy
right
into
a
minefield.
If
planting
mushrooms
at
Dragon
or
Baron
Nashor
,
they
will
provide
vision
if
placed
off
to
the
side.
Don't
forget
that
Noxious
Trap
can
be
placed
down
in
team
fights
and
only
has
a
short
time
to
arm
(1
second).
Doing
this
could
secure
a
kill
or
slow
down
a
enemy
when
he/she
is
trying
to
escape.
If
you
are
suspecting
a
possible
towerdive
from
an
opposing
champion,
place
Noxious
Traps
behind
and
in
front
of
your
turret
in
order
to
slow
and
deal
damage
to
the
enemy.
If
an
enemy
is
engaging
you
at
melee
range,
Noxious
Traps
can
be
used
to
peel
them
off
you
by
placing
one
underneath
you
and
stepping
backwards.
Build
usage
Noxious
Trap's
recharge
time
is
greatly
improved
with
cooldown
reduction
.
Nashor's
Tooth
is
excellent
for
this
purpose.
One
build
route
for
Teemo
is
the
physical
damage
route;
this
route
takes
advantage
of
Teemo's
innately
fast
attack
speed
and
quick
attack
animation
along
with
the
attack
speed
boost
his
innate
ability
provides.
This
involves
getting
items
which
boost
attack
damage
and
attack
speed
,
such
as;
Blade
of
the
Ruined
King
,
The
Black
Cleaver
,
Wit's
End
,
Infinity
Edge
and
The
Bloodthirster
.
Note
that
items
like
The
Black
Cleaver
increase
physical
damage,
while
Nashor's
Tooth
increases
magical
damage.
Building
on-hit
effect
with
physical
damage
items
will
reduce
damage
output
if
you
opt
to
buy
those
shred
items.
Nashor's
Tooth
,
for
example,
will
not
increase
the
damage
that
Infinity
Edge
gives,
while
The
Black
Cleaver
will
not
increase
the
damage
that
Wit's
End
deals.
Additionally,
on-hit
effects
cannot
critically
strike
or
proc
life
steal
.
Keep
this
in
mind
when
buying
items
like
Phantom
Dancer
.
A
second
route
is
the
ability
power
route;
this
route
focuses
on
Teemo's
ability
to
deal
damage
via
Blinding
Dart
,
Toxic
Shot
and
Noxious
Trap
.
This
involves
getting
items
which
boost
AP
,
grant
magic
penetration
and
cooldown
reduction
,
such
as;
Deathfire
Grasp
,
Rabadon's
Deathcap
,
Void
Staff
,
Sorcerer's
Shoes
and
Rod
of
Ages
.
Magic
penetration
will
apply
to
already
existing
traps.
Buying
items
such
as
Void
Staff
or
Haunting
Guise
will
greatly
increase
their
damage,
even
if
they
are
bought
while
you
are
dead.
Teemo
can
build
ability
power
and
attack
speed
with
items
that
proc
on-hit
effects,
like
Wit's
End
or
Nashor's
Tooth
.
These
combos
work
well
with
his
poison's
on-hit
effect.
Building
a
Lich
Bane
on
ability
power
Teemo
can
lead
to
huge
bursts
of
damage.
Nashor's
Tooth
benefits
Teemo's
on-hit
damage,
due
to
its
new
passive.
However,
the
cooldown
reduction
gives
more
opportunities
to
cast
Blinding
Dart
and
Noxious
Trap
,
which
provides
much
utility.
If
building
Teemo
into
a
mage,
Nashor's
Tooth
is
a
must.
Blade
of
the
Ruined
King
gives
Teemo
an
additional
on-hit
effect
while
providing
life
steal
in
one
item.
With
Runaan's
Hurricane
,
Toxic
Shot
s
can
proc
on
up
to
2
additional
enemies.
Liandry's
Torment
combined
with
Noxious
Trap
deal
massive
amount
of
health
burn,
up
to
4%
per
second
per
mushroom.
The
base
amount
is
2%,
doubled
when
the
movement
is
impaired.
The
health
burn
will
refresh
every
poison
tick,
which
occurs
every
one
second.
This
means
the
total
burn
will
equal
20%.
4
seconds
of
doubled
damage
totallying
16%
and
2
seconds
of
normal
damage
countinuing
after
the
poison
expires
totalling
4%.
Toxic
Shot
does
NOT
trigger
Liandry's
Torment's
passive
because
it
is
an
on-hit
effect.
Although
Teemo
has
a
slow
basic
movement
speed,
Move
Quick
significantly
increases
this
out
of
combat.
Combined
with
Boots
of
Mobility
and
Lich
Bane
Teemo
can
move
between
lanes
and
get
back
to
lane
very
quickly.
However,
if
an
enemy
runs
into
one
of
your
traps,
you
will
be
in
combat.
This
means
the
bonus
movement
speed
from
Boots
of
Mobility
will
be
removed.
Guinsoo's
Rageblade
is
an
item
that
works
well
with
on-hit
effect
builds.
It
gives
Teemo
additional
attack
speed
and
ability
power
both
of
which
work
well
with
his
Toxic
Shot
.
A
build
that
uses
Nashor's
Tooth
,
Wit's
End
and
Guinsoo's
Rageblade
can
do
significant
damage.

Countering
Purchasing
Doran's
Shield
can
counter
Teemo
early
game
by
reducing
damage
from
his
autoattacks,
the
initial
damage
from
Toxic
Shot
,
and
the
damage
over
time
from
Toxic
Shot
.
This
is
especially
useful
for
melee
champions
who
will
take
occasional
harass
from
Teemo
in
lane.
Purchasing
,
The
Lightbringer
or
Hextech
Sweeper
will
help
you
see
his
Noxious
Trap
or
Teemo
himself
that
is
hidden
with
his
Camouflage
.
Alternatively,
you
can
set
up
Vision
Ward
in
the
strategic
place
where
you
think
Teemo
will
place
his
Noxious
Trap
.
When
facing
Teemo
as
a
DPS
champion
that
is
auto-attack
reliant,
it
is
best
advised
to
buy
a
Quicksilver
Sash
to
remove
the
blind
CC
from
his
Blinding
Dart
.
Use
a
Health
Potion
when
you
are
low
on
health
and
are
affected
by
Toxic
Shot
,
that
way
you
can
negate
the
poison
damage
from
his
Toxic
Shot
.
Since
most
of
Teemo's
damage
output
comes
from
autoattacks
with
his
Toxic
Shot
,
consider
building
Randuin's
Omen
and
Frozen
Heart
.
More
especially
so
with
the
former
as
it's
passive
and
active
can
negate
Move
Quick
.
Keep
in
note
that
Toxic
Shot
deals
a
lot
of
magic
damage
instead
of
physical
damage
and
you
still
need
some
magic
resistance
along
with
attack
speed
reduction.
When
chasing
an
enemy
Teemo
that
enters
Camouflage
,
area
of
effect
and
skill
shot
abilities
can
forcibly
cause
Teemo
to
break
stealth
and
attempt
to
escape.
Knockback
effects
will
break
Teemo's
Camouflage
as
well.
When
facing
AP
build
Teemo
during
early
game,
they
will
typically
poke
and
run,
letting
their
poison
deal
damage
and
lowering
your
health
gradually,
until
they
are
able
to
burst.
Be
prepared
to
pull
away
if
he
approaches,
and
use
Health
Potions
to
keep
your
health
high.
Do
not
chase
Teemo
if
he
attacks
once
and
then
runs,
particularly
AP
Teemo
,
as
he
is
most
likely
luring
you
through
a
field
of
Noxious
Traps
.
Because
much
of
Teemo's
early
game
poke
is
damage
over
time,
the
Unyielding
mastery
is
more
effective
in
decreasing
his
poke
damage.
If
you
are
using
a
champion
whose
damage
output
is
either
strongly
or
entirely
based
on
their
auto
attacks
(ex.
Tristana
,
Vayne
,
Kog'Maw
,
or
even
Teemo
himself)
you
need
to
purchase
items
to
mitigate
Teemo's
Blinding
Dart
Quicksilver
Sash
and
items
providing
Tenacity
are
quite
useful
(ex.
Mercury's
Treads
and
Zephyr
)
Spirit
of
the
Ancient
Golem
works
better
to
this
end
for
champions
in
need
of
more
survivability.
Teemo
is
often
played
top
lane
and
very
rarely
mid
lane
because
his
Blinding
Dart
,
his
damage
over
time
with
his
Toxic
Shot
and
his
kiting
kit
potential
with
his
Move
Quick
and
Noxious
Traps
can
give
most
melee
bruisers
(i.e.
Garen
,
Riven
,
Nasus
,
Renekton
,
Jax
,
Gangplank
,
Wukong
,
Tryndamere
,
Aatrox
,
Rengar
,
Olaf

Trundle
,
and
Darius
),
assassins
(i.e.
Fizz
,
Akali
,
Master
Yi
,
and
Diana
)
an
extremely
hard
time.
However,
keep
in
note
that
Blinding
Dart
only
blocks
auto-attacks
and
does
not
block
damage
and
crowd-control
effects
from
abilities.
Because
of
this,
AP
mages
with
spells
that
can
outrange
and
outpush
him
(i.e.
Lux
and
Ziggs
)
or
AD
casters
with
spammable
ranged
abilities
(i.e.
Pantheon
and
Zed
)
can
lane
decently
well
against
Teemo
and
zone
him
out.
In
addition,
Noxious
Traps
grants
Teemo
strong
map
control
by
granting
minor
vision
in
addition
to
the
strong
slow
and
damage
over
time
makes
Teemo
relatively
difficult
to
gank
after
level
6.
Coordinate
with
your
jungler
before
level
6
to
shut
down
his
farming
and
bring
Oracle's
Lens
if
necessary.
Yorick
is
considered
to
be
a
strong
counter
to
Teemo
for
many
reasons.
First,
his
passive,
Unholy
Covenant
mitigates
a
lot
of
Teemo
's
poking
harass,
including
Toxic
Shot
.
Second,
Yorick
is
able
to
out-sustain
Teemo
with
his
Omen
of
Famine
.
Third,
his
kit
functions
more
of
a
ranged
AD
caster
rather
than
an
autoattacker,
thus
making
Teemo's
Blinding
Dart
useless.
Finally,
Yorick
can
use
his
ghouls
to
safely
detonate
Noxious
Traps
in
a
safe
distance,
thus
denying
Teemo
lane
and
map
control.

Skill
usage
Sometimes
it
is
better
to
stand
still
and
go
into
Camouflage
for
an
escape
mechanism
than
to
use
Move
Quick
or
Recall
.
Unlike
other
stealth
abilities,
Teemo
loses
Camouflage
if
knocked
up.
When
playing
Teemo
not
in
mid
lane,
an
easy
way
to
get
First
Blood
is
to
use
Camouflage
just
out
of
range
of
their
turrets'
sight
or
at
the
edge
of
the
bush
closest
to
their
turret,
and
wait
for
the
enemy
champion
to
start
farming.
When
they
move
about
right
next
to
you,
Ignite
and
kill
them
with
the
help
of
the
mid
lane
champion
if
necessary.
Exhaust
would
be
useful
with
this
strategy.
Blinding
Dart
can
be
used
to
harass
effectively
and
can
help
Teemo
kill
physical
champions
in
fights.
Blinding
Dart
with
Exhaust
can
destroy
a
champion
who
relies
heavily
on
physical
attacks
like
Tryndamere
or
Caitlyn
.
Apply
blind
first
then
apply
Exhaust
after
the
blind
has
worn
off.
This
will
allow
your
blind
CD
to
refresh
while
your
enemy
is
exhausted,
minimizing
their
DPS.
If
you
use
both
at
the
same
time,
the
blind
will
override
the
attack
damage/ability
power
reduction.
Similarly,
you
can
use
these
two
abilities
on
two
champions,
effectively
taking
them
out
of
the
battle
for
a
few
seconds.
Blinding
Dart
can
be
used
in-between
autoattacks,
which
allows
2
rapid-fire
attacks.
This
is
extremely
important
to
learn
how
to
use
throughout
the
game.
Opening
with
a
normal
attack,
immediately
using
Blinding
Dart
,
then
proceeding
to
autoattack
will
apply
great
burst
damage,
even
during
laning.
Try
mastering
this
combo
to
use
it
on
the
fly
and
you'll
increase
your
ability
power/attack
speed
damage
tremendously.
If
Blinding
Dart
is
used
on
Fiora
before
she
activates
her
ult
Blade
Waltz
it
will
stop
the
damage
from
the
attacks
but
the
on-hit
affects
will
still
apply,
this
will
dramatically
decrease
the
damage
taken.
This
also
applies
to
Warwick's
Infinite
Duress
.
Use
Move
Quick
to
get
back
to
lane
quicker.
Move
Quick
can
also
be
used
to
get
from
lane
to
lane
very
quickly,
allowing
you
to
help
out
in
fights
all
over
the
map.
Using
Ignite
with
your
poison
can
ensure
kills
on
fleeing
enemies.
One
strategy
is
to
place
some
Noxious
Trap
in
your
lane
and
wait
for
the
enemy
to
push.
After
this,
go
into
Camouflage
.
Then,
after
the
enemy
runs
into
a
couple
of
Noxious
Traps
,
use
Blinding
Dart
and
auto
attacks
to
finish
them.
Placing
a
Noxious
Trap
or
two
behind
the
first
turret
and
before
the
2nd
near
the
paths
to
the
jungle
but
not
in
the
minions'
path
can
turn
an
almost
kill
into
an
easy
kill.
Teemo's
Noxious
Trap
can
be
used
to
farm
creep
waves
very
effectively;
it
is
best
to
keep
your
mushrooms
spread
out
and
not
too
close
to
each
other.
If
a
lane
has
enemy
minions
stacking
on
each
other
(especially
the
ranged
minions),
pop
a
Noxious
Trap
down
in
the
middle
of
them
and
watch
them
all
die
in
just
a
few
seconds.
Use
this
only
if
you
need
to
stop
a
wave
immediately
or
stop
future
waves,
because
it
is
necessary
to
maximize
potential
damage
by
increasing
the
number
of
active
shrooms
on
the
map
to
win.
More
shrooms
=
more
chances
of
hitting
them
=
more
net
damage.
Put
a
Noxious
Trap
at
key
locations
on
the
map,
such
as
by
the
Dragon
or
Baron
Nashor
to
reveal
when
your
enemies
might
be
attempting
to
kill
them
or
to
prevent
ganking
and
make
counter
ganks.
This
is
similar
to
a
Sight
Ward
but
the
range
that
Noxious
Trap
reveals
is
much
smaller.
(Tip:
Place
2.
One
near
the
opening
and
one
behind
the
monster.
The
front
one
will
explode
after
an
enemy
steps
on
it,
thwarting
them
from
starting
Baron
or
dragon,
while
the
back
one
will
allow
you
to
see
the
health
of
the
monster
and
whether
it
is
being
attacked)
Depending
on
the
enemy
teams
melee/range
makeup,
you
can
put
a
Noxious
Trap
to
the
side
of
Baron
Nashor
to
reveal
1
or
2
enemy
melee
champions,
or
you
can
place
them
a
little
behind
the
side
of
the
baron
if
there
are
3
or
more.
This
will
usually
reveal
enemy
melee
champions
currently
attempting
to
slay
Baron
Nashor
.
Put
a
Noxious
Trap
inside
brushes
and
entrances
to
your
lanes
or
your
team's
side
of
the
map
to
ensure
maximum
safety.
When
fighting
against
a
Twisted
Fate
,
be
careful
because
if
he
uses
Destiny
any
Noxious
Traps
near
any
ally
will
be
revealed.
When
laying
down
Noxious
Traps
in
the
jungle,
keep
in
mind
that
the
champion
movement
pathing
often
hugs
the
terrain
as
they
take
the
shortest
route
to
the
selected
location.
Laying
traps
against
walls
at
turning
points
will
increase
the
chance
enemies
will
run
into
them
on
their
way
to/from
lanes.
Placing
down
shrooms
in
the
center
will
allow
for
a
more
permanent
ward
(sometimes).
Also,
when
laying
traps
in
a
lane,
remember
that
minions
travel
through
the
middle,
and
if
the
front
minion
runs
into
it
only
he
and
one
minion
behind
him
will
be
hit.
Placing
them
on
the
sides
can
increase
the
chances
of
hitting
a
champion.
Placing
two
to
three
Noxious
Traps
by
the
enemy
red
or
blue
buff
is
generally
a
good
idea
considering
you
might
just
get
lucky
and
steal
it
from
them
while
slowing
their
farming
down.
It's
sometimes
a
good
idea
to
place
a
few
Noxious
Traps
behind
you
before
entering
a
teamfight,
that
way
if
you
begin
to
lose,
your
team
can
run
off
and
lead
the
enemy
right
into
a
minefield.
If
planting
mushrooms
at
Dragon
or
Baron
Nashor
,
they
will
provide
vision
if
placed
off
to
the
side.
Don't
forget
that
Noxious
Trap
can
be
placed
down
in
team
fights
and
only
has
a
short
time
to
arm
(1
second).
Doing
this
could
secure
a
kill
or
slow
down
a
enemy
when
he/she
is
trying
to
escape.
If
you
are
suspecting
a
possible
towerdive
from
an
opposing
champion,
place
Noxious
Traps
behind
and
in
front
of
your
turret
in
order
to
slow
and
deal
damage
to
the
enemy.
If
an
enemy
is
engaging
you
at
melee
range,
Noxious
Traps
can
be
used
to
peel
them
off
you
by
placing
one
underneath
you
and
stepping
backwards.
Build
usage
Noxious
Trap's
recharge
time
is
greatly
improved
with
cooldown
reduction
.
Nashor's
Tooth
is
excellent
for
this
purpose.
One
build
route
for
Teemo
is
the
physical
damage
route;
this
route
takes
advantage
of
Teemo's
innately
fast
attack
speed
and
quick
attack
animation
along
with
the
attack
speed
boost
his
innate
ability
provides.
This
involves
getting
items
which
boost
attack
damage
and
attack
speed
,
such
as;
Blade
of
the
Ruined
King
,
The
Black
Cleaver
,
Wit's
End
,
Infinity
Edge
and
The
Bloodthirster
.
Note
that
items
like
The
Black
Cleaver
increase
physical
damage,
while
Nashor's
Tooth
increases
magical
damage.
Building
on-hit
effect
with
physical
damage
items
will
reduce
damage
output
if
you
opt
to
buy
those
shred
items.
Nashor's
Tooth
,
for
example,
will
not
increase
the
damage
that
Infinity
Edge
gives,
while
The
Black
Cleaver
will
not
increase
the
damage
that
Wit's
End
deals.
Additionally,
on-hit
effects
cannot
critically
strike
or
proc
life
steal
.
Keep
this
in
mind
when
buying
items
like
Phantom
Dancer
.
A
second
route
is
the
ability
power
route;
this
route
focuses
on
Teemo's
ability
to
deal
damage
via
Blinding
Dart
,
Toxic
Shot
and
Noxious
Trap
.
This
involves
getting
items
which
boost
AP
,
grant
magic
penetration
and
cooldown
reduction
,
such
as;
Deathfire
Grasp
,
Rabadon's
Deathcap
,
Void
Staff
,
Sorcerer's
Shoes
and
Rod
of
Ages
.
Magic
penetration
will
apply
to
already
existing
traps.
Buying
items
such
as
Void
Staff
or
Haunting
Guise
will
greatly
increase
their
damage,
even
if
they
are
bought
while
you
are
dead.
Teemo
can
build
ability
power
and
attack
speed
with
items
that
proc
on-hit
effects,
like
Wit's
End
or
Nashor's
Tooth
.
These
combos
work
well
with
his
poison's
on-hit
effect.
Building
a
Lich
Bane
on
ability
power
Teemo
can
lead
to
huge
bursts
of
damage.
Nashor's
Tooth
benefits
Teemo's
on-hit
damage,
due
to
its
new
passive.
However,
the
cooldown
reduction
gives
more
opportunities
to
cast
Blinding
Dart
and
Noxious
Trap
,
which
provides
much
utility.
If
building
Teemo
into
a
mage,
Nashor's
Tooth
is
a
must.
Blade
of
the
Ruined
King
gives
Teemo
an
additional
on-hit
effect
while
providing
life
steal
in
one
item.
With
Runaan's
Hurricane
,
Toxic
Shot
s
can
proc
on
up
to
2
additional
enemies.
Liandry's
Torment
combined
with
Noxious
Trap
deal
massive
amount
of
health
burn,
up
to
4%
per
second
per
mushroom.
The
base
amount
is
2%,
doubled
when
the
movement
is
impaired.
The
health
burn
will
refresh
every
poison
tick,
which
occurs
every
one
second.
This
means
the
total
burn
will
equal
20%.
4
seconds
of
doubled
damage
totallying
16%
and
2
seconds
of
normal
damage
countinuing
after
the
poison
expires
totalling
4%.
Toxic
Shot
does
NOT
trigger
Liandry's
Torment's
passive
because
it
is
an
on-hit
effect.
Although
Teemo
has
a
slow
basic
movement
speed,
Move
Quick
significantly
increases
this
out
of
combat.
Combined
with
Boots
of
Mobility
and
Lich
Bane
Teemo
can
move
between
lanes
and
get
back
to
lane
very
quickly.
However,
if
an
enemy
runs
into
one
of
your
traps,
you
will
be
in
combat.
This
means
the
bonus
movement
speed
from
Boots
of
Mobility
will
be
removed.
Guinsoo's
Rageblade
is
an
item
that
works
well
with
on-hit
effect
builds.
It
gives
Teemo
additional
attack
speed
and
ability
power
both
of
which
work
well
with
his
Toxic
Shot
.
A
build
that
uses
Nashor's
Tooth
,
Wit's
End
and
Guinsoo's
Rageblade
can
do
significant
damage.

Countering
Purchasing
Doran's
Shield
can
counter
Teemo
early
game
by
reducing
damage
from
his
autoattacks,
the
initial
damage
from
Toxic
Shot
,
and
the
damage
over
time
from
Toxic
Shot
.
This
is
especially
useful
for
melee
champions
who
will
take
occasional
harass
from
Teemo
in
lane.
Purchasing
,
The
Lightbringer
or
Hextech
Sweeper
will
help
you
see
his
Noxious
Trap
or
Teemo
himself
that
is
hidden
with
his
Camouflage
.
Alternatively,
you
can
set
up
Vision
Ward
in
the
strategic
place
where
you
think
Teemo
will
place
his
Noxious
Trap
.
When
facing
Teemo
as
a
DPS
champion
that
is
auto-attack
reliant,
it
is
best
advised
to
buy
a
Quicksilver
Sash
to
remove
the
blind
CC
from
his
Blinding
Dart
.
Use
a
Health
Potion
when
you
are
low
on
health
and
are
affected
by
Toxic
Shot
,
that
way
you
can
negate
the
poison
damage
from
his
Toxic
Shot
.
Since
most
of
Teemo's
damage
output
comes
from
autoattacks
with
his
Toxic
Shot
,
consider
building
Randuin's
Omen
and
Frozen
Heart
.
More
especially
so
with
the
former
as
it's
passive
and
active
can
negate
Move
Quick
.
Keep
in
note
that
Toxic
Shot
deals
a
lot
of
magic
damage
instead
of
physical
damage
and
you
still
need
some
magic
resistance
along
with
attack
speed
reduction.
When
chasing
an
enemy
Teemo
that
enters
Camouflage
,
area
of
effect
and
skill
shot
abilities
can
forcibly
cause
Teemo
to
break
stealth
and
attempt
to
escape.
Knockback
effects
will
break
Teemo's
Camouflage
as
well.
When
facing
AP
build
Teemo
during
early
game,
they
will
typically
poke
and
run,
letting
their
poison
deal
damage
and
lowering
your
health
gradually,
until
they
are
able
to
burst.
Be
prepared
to
pull
away
if
he
approaches,
and
use
Health
Potions
to
keep
your
health
high.
Do
not
chase
Teemo
if
he
attacks
once
and
then
runs,
particularly
AP
Teemo
,
as
he
is
most
likely
luring
you
through
a
field
of
Noxious
Traps
.
Because
much
of
Teemo's
early
game
poke
is
damage
over
time,
the
Unyielding
mastery
is
more
effective
in
decreasing
his
poke
damage.
If
you
are
using
a
champion
whose
damage
output
is
either
strongly
or
entirely
based
on
their
auto
attacks
(ex.
Tristana
,
Vayne
,
Kog'Maw
,
or
even
Teemo
himself)
you
need
to
purchase
items
to
mitigate
Teemo's
Blinding
Dart
Quicksilver
Sash
and
items
providing
Tenacity
are
quite
useful
(ex.
Mercury's
Treads
and
Zephyr
)
Spirit
of
the
Ancient
Golem
works
better
to
this
end
for
champions
in
need
of
more
survivability.
Teemo
is
often
played
top
lane
and
very
rarely
mid
lane
because
his
Blinding
Dart
,
his
damage
over
time
with
his
Toxic
Shot
and
his
kiting
kit
potential
with
his
Move
Quick
and
Noxious
Traps
can
give
most
melee
bruisers
(i.e.
Garen
,
Riven
,
Nasus
,
Renekton
,
Jax
,
Gangplank
,
Wukong
,
Tryndamere
,
Aatrox
,
Rengar
,
Olaf
,
Trundle
,
and
Darius
),
assassins
(i.e.
Fizz
,
Akali
,
Master
Yi
,
and
Diana
)
an
extremely
hard
time.
However,
keep
in
note
that
Blinding
Dart
only
blocks
auto-attacks
and
does
not
block
damage
and
crowd-control
effects
from
abilities.
Because
of
this,
AP
mages
with
spells
that
can
outrange
and
outpush
him
(i.e.
Lux
and
Ziggs
)
or
AD
casters
with
spammable
ranged
abilities
(i.e.
Pantheon
and
Zed
)
can
lane
decently
well
against
Teemo
and
zone
him
out.
In
addition,
Noxious
Traps
grants
Teemo
strong
map
control
by
granting
minor
vision
in
addition
to
the
strong
slow
and
damage
over
time
makes
Teemo
relatively
difficult
to
gank
after
level
6.
Coordinate
with
your
jungler
before
level
6
to
shut
down
his
farming
and
bring
Oracle's
Lens
if
necessary.
Yorick
is
considered
to
be
a
strong
counter
to
Teemo
for
many
reasons.
First,
his
passive,
Unholy
Covenant
mitigates
a
lot
of
Teemo
's
poking
harass,
including
Toxic
Shot
.
Second,
Yorick
is
able
to
out-sustain
Teemo
with
his
Omen
of
Famine
.
Third,
his
kit
functions
more
of
a
ranged
AD
caster
rather
than
an
autoattacker,
thus
making
Teemo's
Blinding
Dart
useless.
Finally,
Yorick
can
use
his
ghouls
to
safely
detonate
Noxious
Traps
in
a
safe
distance,
thus
denying
Teemo
lane
and
map
control.

yi
Friends
&amp;
Rivals
Champion
Through
the
ancient
martial
art
of
Wuju,
Master
Yi
tempered
his
body
and
sharpened
his
mind
until
thought
and
action
became
one.
Though
he
chooses
to
enter
into
violence
as
a
last
resort,
the
grace
and
speed
with
which
he
wields
his
blade
ensures
resolution
is
always
swift.
As
the
last
living
practitioner
of
Wuju,
Master
Yi
has
devoted
his
life
to
finding
able
pupils
to
carry
on
the
legacy
of
his
lost
people.
Even
before
Yi
mastered
Wuju,
he
was
considered
one
of
the
most
skilled
practitioners
of
the
mystical
martial
art.
He
would
soon
prove
his
mastery
when
word
of
a
massive
Noxian
invasion
reached
his
remote
village.
Yi
swept
across
the
battlefields
of
Ionia
,
turning
back
the
tide
of
Noxus's
vast
infantry
with
swift
and
deadly
strikes,
much
to
the
embarrassment
of
the
Noxian
High
Command.
Recognizing
the
threat
the
Wuju
disciples
posed
to
their
invasion,
the
Noxians
chose
to
unleash
a
nightmarish
chemical
attack
on
the
home
of
the
deadly
art.
Those
who
somehow
survived
the
poisonous
concoction
had
their
minds
twisted
beyond
repair.
Yi's
home
was
left
in
ruin.
At
the
war's
conclusion,
Yi
returned
to
the
grotesque
remains
of
his
village.
There
he
became
the
attack's
final
casualty.
Slain
in
spirit,
if
not
in
body,
Yi
clung
to
the
only
feeling
left
within
his
heart:
vengeance.
Driven
only
by
his
desire
to
punish
those
who'd
destroyed
his
home,
Yi
spent
years
training
in
seclusion.
He
became
a
deadlier
swordsman
than
he
had
ever
been,
but
true
mastery
of
Wuju
still
eluded
him.
At
the
height
of
Yi's
frustration,
a
monkey
of
unusually
noble
bearing
interrupted
his
training.
Standing
as
straight
and
tall
as
a
man,
the
monkey
watched
and
mimicked
Yi's
movements.
Yi
shooed
the
monkey
away,
but
the
agile
creature
took
great
amusement
in
turning
Yi's
own
techniques
against
him.
Gradually,
Yi
felt
his
anger
subside
as
he
sparred
with
the
playful
animal,
and
when
the
burden
of
his
hatred
had
fully
lifted,
he
found
he
had
caught
the
monkey
by
his
tail.
Yi
then
understood
that
he
would
never
master
Wuju
so
long
as
he
pursued
it
for
vengeance,
and
as
he
let
go
of
the
monkey,
he
also
released
his
desire
to
shed
his
enemy's
blood.
Yi
thanked
the
monkey
for
showing
him
what
he'd
been
blind
to,
and
was
surprised
when
the
creature
actually
replied.
He
wished
to
learn
Yi's
art
of
fighting.
It
was
an
odd
request,
but
through
it
Yi
saw
his
new
path:
the
way
to
honor
the
memory
of
his
lost
people
was
to
pass
their
teachings
on
to
a
new
generation.
&quot;The
edge
of
the
sharpest
blade
is
no
match
for
the
calm
of
the
peaceful
mind.&quot;

Master
Yi
Keeper
of
the
ancient
art
of
Wuju,
Master
Yi
is
a
mystical
warrior
from
the
isle
of
Ionia
.
He
descended
from
one
of
the
few
tribes
dedicated
to
the
preservation
of
Wuju,
a
martial
art
founded
with
the
principles
of
absolute
spiritual
awareness
of
one's
self
and
one's
enemy.
When
the
armies
of
Noxus
invaded
Ionia,
Master
Yi
joined
in
the
Ionian
defense
to
fight
the
craven
enemy,
bringing
his
village
honor
through
his
unparalleled
mastery
of
the
blade.
The
ensuing
battles
ravaged
the
land,
but
no
conflict
inflicted
as
much
horror
as
the
day
the
armies
of
Noxus
closed
in
on
Yi's
village.
Left
undefended,
the
village
became
the
unfortunate
test
subject
of
the
latest
invention
by
an
up-and-coming
chemist,
now
known
as
Singed
.
The
remains
of
the
village
that
Master
Yi
returned
to
were
so
horrific
that
it
remains
a
festering
scar
on
Ionian
history.
To
this
day,
no
Ionian
will
ever
publicly
speak
of
what
occurred.
After
the
Noxian
invasion
was
contained,
Master
Yi
fell
into
a
deep
isolation.
For
years,
he
trained
morning
to
night,
speaking
to
no
one
and
refusing
offers
of
consolation
by
fellow
Ionians.
The
only
thing
stopping
him
from
madly
charging
into
Noxus
battle
lines
headfirst
was
his
pledge
to
keep
the
Wuju
style
alive.
Even
though
he
seethed
with
impatience,
his
rage
became
a
tool
for
sharpening
his
practice
of
Wuju,
developing
stronger
and
deadlier
skills
for
his
eventual
vengeance.
The
only
thing
that
roused
him
was
news
of
the
League's
formation,
and
Noxus's
subsequent
enrollment
in
the
League.
Master
Yi
now
brings
his
mastery
of
the
blade
to
the
League
of
Legends
with
unflinching
purpose:
to
avenge
his
kinfolk
and
end
the
predations
of
the
Noxus
once
and
for
all.
&quot;The
art
of
Wuju
lives
on
in
Master
Yi,
and
is
plunged
through
the
hearts
of
his
foes.&quot;

Soraka,
The
Starchild
If
asked,
Yi
will
tell
you
he
was
born
from
wisps
of
the
cosmos,
and
that
is
why
he
moves
like
the
wind.
Those
who
have
faced
him
in
combat
know
the
bite
of
the
Wuju
Bladesman
-
he
strikes
twice,
without
warning,
and
is
gone.
Often,
the
only
clue
that
you
are
about
to
be
struck
by
Master
Yi
is
the
hiss
of
his
blade
as
it
parts
the
air.
Keeper
of
the
ancient
art
of
Wuju,
Master
Yi
is
a
mystical
warrior
from
the
isle
of
Ionia
.
His
village
was
steeped
in
Wuju,
and
his
kinfolk
were
some
of
the
few
to
carry
the
tradition
into
the
modern
day.
That
is,
until
the
armies
of
Noxus
came
to
Ionia,
ravaging
the
land.
Master
Yi
went
to
fight
the
craven
enemy,
bringing
his
village
honor
through
his
unparalleled
mastery
of
the
blade.
However,
in
his
absence,
the
armies
of
Noxus
closed
in
and
tested
the
latest
invention
of
the
chemist
now
known
as
Singed
.
What
was
done
to
his
village
is
something
of
which
Master
Yi
will
not
speak.
However,
he
has
brought
his
mastery
of
the
blade
to
the
League
of
Legends
in
order
to
avenge
his
kinfolk
and
end
the
predations
of
the
Noxus
once
and
for
all.
Master
Yi
brings
the
art
of
the
Wuju
style
in
a
way
that
makes
his
enemies
falter.
He
is
capable
of
fighting
with
lightning
speed,
as
well
as
finding
purchase
behind
the
defenses
of
an
enemy's
armor.
He
can
call
on
his
inner
fortitude,
regenerating
at
an
accelerated
rate.
Calling
upon
ancient
forces,
Master
Yi
can
fold
space,
appearing
behind
enemy
after
enemy.
He
is
even
able
to
reject
magic,
rendering
it
useless
against
him.
Master
Yi
himself
has
studied
the
arts
of
Wuju
for
more
than
a
thousand
years.
He
is
the
oldest
known
living
human
on
Valoran,
but
to
gaze
upon
him,
you
would
guess
him
no
more
than
thirty
years
old.
The
art
of
Wuju
lives
on
in
Master
Yi,
and
is
plunged
through
the
hearts
of
his
foes.
[1]
Goggles
from
the
Revered
Inventor
The
goggles
Master
Yi
wears
are
a
techmaturgical
device
that
was
gifted
to
the
champion
by
Piltover's
own
Heimerdinger,
the
Revered
Inventor
.
Master
Yi
first
used
these
goggles
when
defending
his
homeland
from
Noxus
invaders
in
the
time
after
the
League
has
just
formed
and
before
Ionia
had
affiliated
itself
with
the
League.
The
goggles
are
fitted
specifically
for
Master
Yi;
while
someone
else
may
wear
them,
they
won't
receive
anywhere
near
the
same
benefit
as
he
does
himself.
The
one-of-a-kind
goggles,
known
as
the
&quot;Seven
Lenses
of
Insight&quot;,
allow
Master
Yi
to
see
across
a
wider
range
of
the
spectrum
than
normal
people
see.
They
also
give
him
abilities
not
dissimilar
to
that
of
real
world
binoculars
and
telescopes.
The
goggles
are
synced
to
Yi's
own
magical
resonance,
allowing
him
to
adjust
settings
without
the
use
of
his
hands.
He
simply
thinks
what
he
needs,
and
the
goggles
act
accordingly.

Champion
Through
the
ancient
martial
art
of
Wuju,
Master
Yi
tempered
his
body
and
sharpened
his
mind
until
thought
and
action
became
one.
Though
he
chooses
to
enter
into
violence
as
a
last
resort,
the
grace
and
speed
with
which
he
wields
his
blade
ensures
resolution
is
always
swift.
As
the
last
living
practitioner
of
Wuju,
Master
Yi
has
devoted
his
life
to
finding
able
pupils
to
carry
on
the
legacy
of
his
lost
people.
Even
before
Yi
mastered
Wuju,
he
was
considered
one
of
the
most
skilled
practitioners
of
the
mystical
martial
art.
He
would
soon
prove
his
mastery
when
word
of
a
massive
Noxian
invasion
reached
his
remote
village.
Yi
swept
across
the
battlefields
of
Ionia
,
turning
back
the
tide
of
Noxus's
vast
infantry
with
swift
and
deadly
strikes,
much
to
the
embarrassment
of
the
Noxian
High
Command.
Recognizing
the
threat
the
Wuju
disciples
posed
to
their
invasion,
the
Noxians
chose
to
unleash
a
nightmarish
chemical
attack
on
the
home
of
the
deadly
art.
Those
who
somehow
survived
the
poisonous
concoction
had
their
minds
twisted
beyond
repair.
Yi's
home
was
left
in
ruin.
At
the
war's
conclusion,
Yi
returned
to
the
grotesque
remains
of
his
village.
There
he
became
the
attack's
final
casualty.
Slain
in
spirit,
if
not
in
body,
Yi
clung
to
the
only
feeling
left
within
his
heart:
vengeance.
Driven
only
by
his
desire
to
punish
those
who'd
destroyed
his
home,
Yi
spent
years
training
in
seclusion.
He
became
a
deadlier
swordsman
than
he
had
ever
been,
but
true
mastery
of
Wuju
still
eluded
him.
At
the
height
of
Yi's
frustration,
a
monkey
of
unusually
noble
bearing
interrupted
his
training.
Standing
as
straight
and
tall
as
a
man,
the
monkey
watched
and
mimicked
Yi's
movements.
Yi
shooed
the
monkey
away,
but
the
agile
creature
took
great
amusement
in
turning
Yi's
own
techniques
against
him.
Gradually,
Yi
felt
his
anger
subside
as
he
sparred
with
the
playful
animal,
and
when
the
burden
of
his
hatred
had
fully
lifted,
he
found
he
had
caught
the
monkey
by
his
tail.
Yi
then
understood
that
he
would
never
master
Wuju
so
long
as
he
pursued
it
for
vengeance,
and
as
he
let
go
of
the
monkey,
he
also
released
his
desire
to
shed
his
enemy's
blood.
Yi
thanked
the
monkey
for
showing
him
what
he'd
been
blind
to,
and
was
surprised
when
the
creature
actually
replied.
He
wished
to
learn
Yi's
art
of
fighting.
It
was
an
odd
request,
but
through
it
Yi
saw
his
new
path:
the
way
to
honor
the
memory
of
his
lost
people
was
to
pass
their
teachings
on
to
a
new
generation.
&quot;The
edge
of
the
sharpest
blade
is
no
match
for
the
calm
of
the
peaceful
mind.&quot;

Master
Yi
Keeper
of
the
ancient
art
of
Wuju,
Master
Yi
is
a
mystical
warrior
from
the
isle
of
Ionia
.
He
descended
from
one
of
the
few
tribes
dedicated
to
the
preservation
of
Wuju,
a
martial
art
founded
with
the
principles
of
absolute
spiritual
awareness
of
one's
self
and
one's
enemy.
When
the
armies
of
Noxus
invaded
Ionia,
Master
Yi
joined
in
the
Ionian
defense
to
fight
the
craven
enemy,
bringing
his
village
honor
through
his
unparalleled
mastery
of
the
blade.
The
ensuing
battles
ravaged
the
land,
but
no
conflict
inflicted
as
much
horror
as
the
day
the
armies
of
Noxus
closed
in
on
Yi's
village.
Left
undefended,
the
village
became
the
unfortunate
test
subject
of
the
latest
invention
by
an
up-and-coming
chemist,
now
known
as
Singed
.
The
remains
of
the
village
that
Master
Yi
returned
to
were
so
horrific
that
it
remains
a
festering
scar
on
Ionian
history.
To
this
day,
no
Ionian
will
ever
publicly
speak
of
what
occurred.
After
the
Noxian
invasion
was
contained,
Master
Yi
fell
into
a
deep
isolation.
For
years,
he
trained
morning
to
night,
speaking
to
no
one
and
refusing
offers
of
consolation
by
fellow
Ionians.
The
only
thing
stopping
him
from
madly
charging
into
Noxus
battle
lines
headfirst
was
his
pledge
to
keep
the
Wuju
style
alive.
Even
though
he
seethed
with
impatience,
his
rage
became
a
tool
for
sharpening
his
practice
of
Wuju,
developing
stronger
and
deadlier
skills
for
his
eventual
vengeance.
The
only
thing
that
roused
him
was
news
of
the
League's
formation,
and
Noxus's
subsequent
enrollment
in
the
League.
Master
Yi
now
brings
his
mastery
of
the
blade
to
the
League
of
Legends
with
unflinching
purpose:
to
avenge
his
kinfolk
and
end
the
predations
of
the
Noxus
once
and
for
all.
&quot;The
art
of
Wuju
lives
on
in
Master
Yi,
and
is
plunged
through
the
hearts
of
his
foes.&quot;

Soraka,
The
Starchild
If
asked,
Yi
will
tell
you
he
was
born
from
wisps
of
the
cosmos,
and
that
is
why
he
moves
like
the
wind.
Those
who
have
faced
him
in
combat
know
the
bite
of
the
Wuju
Bladesman
-
he
strikes
twice,
without
warning,
and
is
gone.
Often,
the
only
clue
that
you
are
about
to
be
struck
by
Master
Yi
is
the
hiss
of
his
blade
as
it
parts
the
air.
Keeper
of
the
ancient
art
of
Wuju,
Master
Yi
is
a
mystical
warrior
from
the
isle
of
Ionia
.
His
village
was
steeped
in
Wuju,
and
his
kinfolk
were
some
of
the
few
to
carry
the
tradition
into
the
modern
day.
That
is,
until
the
armies
of
Noxus
came
to
Ionia,
ravaging
the
land.
Master
Yi
went
to
fight
the
craven
enemy,
bringing
his
village
honor
through
his
unparalleled
mastery
of
the
blade.
However,
in
his
absence,
the
armies
of
Noxus
closed
in
and
tested
the
latest
invention
of
the
chemist
now
known
as
Singed
.
What
was
done
to
his
village
is
something
of
which
Master
Yi
will
not
speak.
However,
he
has
brought
his
mastery
of
the
blade
to
the
League
of
Legends
in
order
to
avenge
his
kinfolk
and
end
the
predations
of
the
Noxus
once
and
for
all.
Master
Yi
brings
the
art
of
the
Wuju
style
in
a
way
that
makes
his
enemies
falter.
He
is
capable
of
fighting
with
lightning
speed,
as
well
as
finding
purchase
behind
the
defenses
of
an
enemy's
armor.
He
can
call
on
his
inner
fortitude,
regenerating
at
an
accelerated
rate.
Calling
upon
ancient
forces,
Master
Yi
can
fold
space,
appearing
behind
enemy
after
enemy.
He
is
even
able
to
reject
magic,
rendering
it
useless
against
him.
Master
Yi
himself
has
studied
the
arts
of
Wuju
for
more
than
a
thousand
years.
He
is
the
oldest
known
living
human
on
Valoran,
but
to
gaze
upon
him,
you
would
guess
him
no
more
than
thirty
years
old.
The
art
of
Wuju
lives
on
in
Master
Yi,
and
is
plunged
through
the
hearts
of
his
foes.

Goggles
from
the
Revered
Inventor
The
goggles
Master
Yi
wears
are
a
techmaturgical
device
that
was
gifted
to
the
champion
by
Piltover's
own
Heimerdinger,
the
Revered
Inventor
.
Master
Yi
first
used
these
goggles
when
defending
his
homeland
from
Noxus
invaders
in
the
time
after
the
League
has
just
formed
and
before
Ionia
had
affiliated
itself
with
the
League.
The
goggles
are
fitted
specifically
for
Master
Yi;
while
someone
else
may
wear
them,
they
won't
receive
anywhere
near
the
same
benefit
as
he
does
himself.
The
one-of-a-kind
goggles,
known
as
the
&quot;Seven
Lenses
of
Insight&quot;,
allow
Master
Yi
to
see
across
a
wider
range
of
the
spectrum
than
normal
people
see.
They
also
give
him
abilities
not
dissimilar
to
that
of
real
world
binoculars
and
telescopes.
The
goggles
are
synced
to
Yi's
own
magical
resonance,
allowing
him
to
adjust
settings
without
the
use
of
his
hands.
He
simply
thinks
what
he
needs,
and
the
goggles
act
accordingly.

Clearing
Obstacles
for
a
Rematch
Noxus
responds
to
the
monks
plight
Quinton
Groat
reporting
from
Noxus
The
tragic
news
of
the
Shojin
monk
,
who
suffers
even
now,
has
shocked
Runeterrans
everywhere.
Flowers
and
well-wishes
have
arrived
at
the
Shojin
Monastery
in
droves.
Public
vigils
have
been
held
in
every
city-state,
and
hundreds
of
letters
have
been
sent
to
the
Institute
of
War
,
pleading
for
intervention
on
behalf
of
the
monk.
This
event
is
heartbreaking,
but
the
amount
of
public
response
generated
for
one
man
is
inspiring.
Today,
in
the
midst
of
all
these
stirred
emotions,
the
Noxian
High
Command
made
a
stunning
announcement.
Chancellor
Malek
Hawkmoon,
the
officer
of
the
Noxian
High
Command
charged
with
overseeing
the
Noxian
presence
in
Ionia
,
gave
this
statement
after
returning
from
an
emergency
conference
in
Noxus.
&quot;After
conferring
with
my
honored
colleagues
in
the
High
Command,
we
have
decided
to
take
this
grievous
situation
into
our
own
hands
and
bring
the
people
of
Valoran
some
peace.
Before
I
go
into
further
detail,
I
would
like
to
address
some
of
the
statements
which
have
been
made
surrounding
our
presence
in
Ionia.&quot;
&quot;It
has
been
said
that
Noxus
is
a
heartless,
imperialistic
war
machine.
It
has
been
implied
that
ours
is
the
seat
of
evil.
I
would
like
to
assure
you,
we
have
families,
homes,
and
children
just
like
anyone
else,
and
our
soldiers
in
Ionia
miss
theirs
dearly.
Our
undertaking
there
has
been
in
the
service
of
the
Ionians.
In
the
wake
of
the
war,
these
southern
provinces
were
left
in
debris
and
disarray.
We
have
spent
our
own
precious
resources
rebuilding
what
was
lost
and
the
'riches
we
now
plunder'
are
far
from
compensation
for
what
we
have
invested
in
these
efforts.&quot;
&quot;Noxus
is
indeed
a
war
machine,
for
this
we
are
proud,
not
ashamed.
Our
sons
put
their
lives
at
stake
in
the
pursuit
of
excellence.
We
respect
those
who
meet
us
on
the
battlefield
too
much
to
treat
them
like
children
or
invalids.
If
you
oppose
Noxian
forces,
you
are
considered
an
equal
opponent,
and
granted
no
quarter,
as
such
is
the
highest
insult
amongst
true
warriors.
It
is
a
disgrace
to
cross
blades
with
an
enemy
and
then
cry
oppression
when
you
are
bested.
Ionia
was
given
the
option
to
surrender
without
violence,
as
are
all
nations
which
the
noble
Noxian
forces
visit.
They
declined,
and
they
lost.
I
wonder
if
the
public
would
react
the
same
way
if
Noxus
requested
repayment
for
the
sons
it
lost
in
the
Ionian
incursion.&quot;
&quot;Now,
as
I
said,
Noxus
has
decided
to
do
what
is
in
its
power
to
bring
peace
to
Valoran,
though
we
have
received
nothing
but
threats
and
slander
since
the
monks
protest
began.
Noxian
blood
is
infused
with
the
scent
of
the
battlefield,
and
Noxians
do
not
hide
behind
politics.
Make
no
mistake,
challenging
the
edicts
of
the
League
of
Legends
is
not
only
unlawful,
but
undermining
to
a
system
which
has
saved
Runeterra
from
ruin.
However,
it
is
our
right
to
grant
Ionia
its
rematch
before
the
proper
term
has
elapsed,
and
we
have
heard
their
plea.
If
Ionia
desires
to
meet
Noxus
on
the
Fields
of
Justice
to
determine
the
fate
of
the
southern
provinces,
then
we
accept
the
terms
and
encourage
them
to
send
their
very
best.&quot;
The
Ionian
Elders
called
an
assembly
immediately
following
Hawkmoon's
speech,
and
they
promised
that
an
official
response
was
soon
to
follow.
The
Master
of
Metal
Mordekaiser
and
Zaun's
Techma-Tune
scene
Jace
P.
Prest
reporting
from
Zaun
Sona
and
Mordekaiser
storm
Zaun
with
their
wildly
popular
band,
Pentakill
Down
in
the
slums
of
Zaun
,
where
the
gutters
glow
green
with
techmaturgical
runoff,
one
can
find
all
manner
of
unsavory
characters:
the
disreputable,
the
disadvantaged,
and
the
disillusioned.
These
are
the
homes
of
back-alley
sorcerers
and
shimmer
addicts,
all
those
whom
critics
say
are
the
byproducts
of
Zaun's
rapid
and
reckless
research
initiatives.
Yet,
despite
(or
perhaps,
because
of)
the
many
negative
images
associated
with
the
Zaunite
slums,
thrill
seekers
frequently
venture
down
to
these
dark
alleys.
They
come
in
larger
numbers
every
week,
and
all
come
for
one
reason:
the
undeniable
allure
of
Zaun's
underground
techmaturgical
music
scene.
With
instruments
powered
by
techmaturgical
amplification,
&quot;Techma-Tune&quot;
musicians
and
their
strange,
wailing
sound
have
been
gaining
ground
in
Zaunian
taverns
for
years.
Those
hip
to
the
scene
gather
in
droves
to
listen
to
the
stylings
of
bands
such
as
&quot;The
Hexbenders&quot;,
&quot;
Yordle
Mothership&quot;,
or
&quot;Tainted
Nexus
&quot;.
For
the
price
of
a
cheap
(and
questionably
concocted)
beverage,
any
traveler
can
shove
for
shoulder-room
to
see
these
talented
groups
perform.
Though
the
Techma-Tune
movement
has
long
been
an
unknown
scene
outside
of
Zaun,
a
new
star
recently
pushed
interest
in
this
genre
of
music
beyond
Zaun's
borders
and
into
the
hearts
and
minds
of
countless
Valorans.
For
the
past
few
months,
Mordekaiser,
the
Master
of
Metal
and
champion
of
the
League,
has
been
storming
the
stages
of
Zaun
with
devastating
effect
as
lead
guitarist
of
the
band
&quot;Pentakill&quot;.
His
dark,
pounding
rhythms
resonate
deeply
with
his
followers.
One
fan
says,
&quot;His
strings
speak
to
the
torment
of
my
existence.&quot;
Another
gushes,
&quot;I
know
that
deep
beneath
that
armor
beats
a
broken
heart
like
mine.
I
love
you,
Mordekaiser!&quot;
We
had
the
privilege
of
speaking
briefly
with
the
League
fighter
and
night
rocker:
JP:
Mordekaiser,
you're
an
enigma
both
in
and
out
of
the
arena.
What
draws
you
away
from
the
Field
of
Justice
to
pursue
this
surprising
side-project?
M:
My
fans.
I
am
drawn
to
their
disease.
JP:
You
mean
their
feverish
love
of
this
Techma-Tune
music?
M:
No.
Pentakill's
popularity
exploded
recently
when
Mordekaiser
appeared
on
stage
with
an
unlikely
co-star:
Sona,
the
League's
darling
diva
!
The
masterful
mistress
of
strings
has
been
regularly
rocking
at
Mordekaiser's
side
in
true
Techma-Tune
style,
clad
in
silver
chains
and
black
finery.
The
two
have
been
busy
releasing
more
captivating
singles
than
ever
before,
with
Sona's
otherworldly
serenades
adding
a
somber
and
captivating
undertone
to
Mordekaiser's
gritty,
powerful
chords.
Though
Sona
was
(understandably)
unavailable
for
comment,
Mordekaiser
has
confirmed
his
desire
to
expand
the
ensemble
further
into
a
full
band:
&quot;I
would
welcome
those
who
would
bring
my
music
further
power.
We
are
known
as
Pentakill,
and
we
shall
rock
as
no
other.
Join
us,
if
you
are
so
bold.&quot;
Hear
Pentakill
perform
their
new
hit,
&quot;Mask
of
Madness&quot;
at
Trogsworth's
Tavern
in
the
heart
of
Zauns
trade
district
any
night
this
week.
Be
warned

it's
standing
room
only
and
the
crowd
can
get
a
little
raucous.
Also,
if
you
yourself
are
a
talented
techma-musician,
gather
your
courage
and
approach
the
stage
afterwards
for
a
personal
audition!
The
Unstoppable
Hurricane
Friends
and
foes
alike
celebrate
the
Might
of
Demacia
Aria
Breker
commenting
from
Demacia
The
pursuit
of
justice
is
often
a
thankless
job.
When
our
soldiers
are
tirelessly
toiling
on
the
front
lines,
their
benevolence
is
often
met
with
hostility,
even
from
those
who
they
are
trying
to
protect
and
defend.
However,
there
are
often
happier
and
unintended
side
effects
for
those
who
fight
under
Demacia
's
banner.
Garen
,
one
of
Demacia's
League
champions,
now
finds
himself
at
the
center
of
attention
from
citizens
and
summoners
alike
due
to
his
domination
on
the
Fields
of
Justice.
His
battle
prowess
has
brought
widespread
fame
to
both
himself
and
our
grand
city-state.
Eyes
have
turned
to
Garen
as
a
leader,
carrying
his
teams
to
victory
in
the
name
of
Demacia.
Recent
broadcast
matches
featuring
the
Might
of
Demacia
have
drawn
extraordinary
amounts
of
excitement.
Spectators
are
often
found
reveling
in
the
streets
of
almost
every
city-state
after
a
match,
ecstatically
hailing
Garen's
performance
on
the
battlefield.
Fans
describe
Garen
as
&quot;tireless&quot;,
&quot;invincible&quot;,
and
&quot;...almost
as
if
he
never
needs
to
cool
down&quot;.
They
delight
in
the
fact
that
he
is
able
to
silence
enemies
with
the
mighty
swing
of
his
blade,
seemingly
unconstrained
by
the
limitations
that
other
champions
seem
to
face.
The
artistic
have
taken
to
expressing
their
admiration
for
Garen's
skill
by
deluging
the
local
markets
with
paintings
and
songs
reflecting
Demacian
pride.
Children
run
through
the
streets
of
city-states
across
Valoran,
yelling
&quot;DEMACIA!&quot;
much
to
the
chagrin
of
parents
trying
to
instill
their
offspring
with
pride
for
their
own
city-states.
Garen
has
made
quite
an
impression
on
non-supporters
as
well.
Even
those
who
support
other
champions
in
the
League
grudgingly
acknowledge
his
unmistakable
battle
presence.
Opponents
have
been
overheard
calling
him
an
&quot;unstoppable
hurricane&quot;.
Others
swear
that
they
can
almost
see
Garen's
mighty
sword
striking
down
from
above
when
he
claims
a
foe.
Not
all
opinions
are
positive,
however,
with
dissenters
complaining
about
Garen
being
judgmental
on
the
battlefield;
painfully
so.
Some
claim
that
he
seems
overpowered,
as
though
Garen's
fighting
ability
and
battle-tested
skills
were
anything
but
well-earned
from
experience.
Demacian
military
officials
have
taken
note
of
Garen's
exceptional
performance.
Already
the
leader
of
the
Dauntless
Vanguard,
Garen
was
called
upon
to
bring
his
expertise
to
overhaul
Demacia's
military
training.
His
training
program,
called
&quot;Battle
Regimen
for
Ultimate
Soldier
Heroism&quot;,
has
since
been
introduced
to
the
entire
Demacian
army.
It
is
a
well-crafted
conditioning
program
wherein
soldiers
learn
a
variety
of
tactics
and
strategies
employed
by
Garen
on
the
Fields
of
Justice,
including
perseverance,
courage,
and
how
to
strike
decisively
against
our
foes.
Armed
with
the
&quot;Battle
Regimen
for
Ultimate
Soldier
Heroism&quot;
fighting
strategy,
the
enemies
of
justice
have
much
to
fear.
When
the
Demacian
army
descends
upon
challengers,
our
enemies
will
not
stand
a
chance
against
the
whirlwind
of
might.

Who
Didn't
See
This
Coming?
Just
a
few
days
ago,
Calliope
Productions
(located
in
Demacia)
announced
its
latest
musical,
The
Sound
of
Magic
.
Now,
normally
this
reporter
could
not
care
less
about
musicals,
so
why
the
sudden
interest
in
this
one?
Because
this
one
is
helmed
by
the
Gemknight
himself!
The
Sound
of
Magic
isn't
just
a
musical

it's
a
symphonic
bonanza.
This
reporter
was
fortunate
enough
(depending
upon
your
point
of
view)
to
have
been
allowed
into
one
of
the
rehearsals.
The
songs
are
epic,
pretty
much
everyone
is
dancing,
and
the
costumes
are,
well,
outrageous.
I've
never
seen
so
much
frilly
business
in
my
entire
life,
and
the
colors
make
it
look
like
a
flower
bed
threw
up.
Taric
is
the
lead
designer
in
all
of
this,
and
it
shows.
The
Gemknight
actually
deigned
to
give
me
a
few
choice
words:
&quot;I'm
excited
about
this
opportunity.
Musical
theater
has
always,
in
some
way,
been
in
my
blood.
This
production
is
top
notch
and
I
am
honored
to
be
center
stage.
It's
wonderful
that
I
get
to
show
my
fans
a
different
side
of
me.&quot;
It
certainly
is
going
to
be
a
stark
contrast
to
butt-kicking
for
a
living,
that's
for
sure.
Hopefully,
the
prime
performances
won't
interfere
with
Taric's
duties
to
the
League
of
Legends.
If
not,
maybe
he
can
bring
some
singing
and
dancing
to
his
battles

maybe
even
in
one
of
those
frilly
costumes...
as
long
as
they
don't
clash
with
his
hammer!
Little
Poppy's
Big
Vacation
As
both
Bandle
City's
ambassador
to
Demacia
and
as
a
champion
in
the
League
of
Legends,
Poppy
certainly
has
a
lot
of
responsibility.
She
also
has
fame
and
power,
which
give
her
command
over
resources
that
would
make
this
reporter
blush...
and
she's
been
busted
for
abusing
it!
How,
you
might
ask?
How
could
such
a
beloved
Champion,
such
a
sweet
little
yordle,
be
guilty
of
abusing
anything?
By
using
those
resources
to
travel
to
Seafoam,
the
exclusive
resort
on
the
western
coast,
vacation
spot
for
the
wealthy
of
Demacia.
This
reporter
received
a
tip
from
an
anonymous
source
which
revealed
the
following
information.
According
to
her
position,
Poppy
is
given
a
certain
amount
of
money
a
year
to
travel
as
an
ambassador.
This
amount
is
significant,
but
not
enough
for
a
luxury
vacation

but
this
is
exactly
where
the
money
came
from.
The
yordle
Champion
racked
up
room
service
bills,
spa
days,
shopping
sprees
on
the
renowned
Grayhill
Road,
and
a
stay
in
the
penthouse
suite
of
a
five-star
resort
hotel.
The
estimated
cost
of
this
single
vacation
is
far
in
excess
of
the
annual
income
of
most
Valorian
citizens.
Naturally,
neither
Poppy
nor
any
of
her
staff
was
available
for
comment.
Do
I
believe
Poppy
has
a
tough
job?
Yes.
Do
I
believe
she
deserves
time
off
to
enjoy
her
life?
Absolutely.
Do
I
believe
that
she
should
be
allowed
to
take
over-the-top
expensive
vacations
on
the
Demacian
tax-payers
money?
No
way.
So
what
can
we
do
to
hold
officials
like
Poppy
accountable
during
moments
of
financial
mismanagement
like
this?
It
is
the
responsibility
of
you,
the
reader,
to
write
to
the
Demacian
government,
and
let
your
opinions
be
known!
On
the
other
hand,
the
question
many
readers
will
want
an
answer
to:
does
Poppy
take
Whomper
to
the
beach?
This
reporter
thinks
yes.
Dear
Mr.
Steed
Once
again,
I
dig
into
my
mailbag
to
see
what
sort
of
fascinating
letters
you,
the
readers,
have
sent
me.
This
week's
question
is
interesting.
&quot;Dear
Mr.
Steed

Has
Rammus
ever
tried
to
encourage
other
armadillos
to
go
into
the
Kumungu
Jungle
in
hopes
they
might
also
change?&quot;
--
Salindor
the
Summoner
Consider
that
you're
the
only
sentient
armadillo
on
Valoran,
and
you're
a
guy.
What
do
you
think
would
eventually
something
that
you'd
want
in
your
life?
That's
right

a
female
counterpart.
Rammus
has
been
around
the
League
for
a
while
now.
When
asked,
Rammus
had
this
to
say:
&quot;Shut
up.&quot;
Sources
close
to
Rammus
say
that
he
is
unabashed
in
finding
young
female
armadillos
and
trying
to
get
them
to
go
to
the
Plague
Lands.
He's
offered
protection
and
everything.
There
are
some
who
have
gone
with
him,
but
the
rare
magic
that
created
Rammus
in
the
first
place
isn't
likely
to
come
out
and
play
just
because
someone
asks.
It
hasn't
stopped
him
from
trying,
and
he
has
no
lack
of
volunteers,
as
it
appears
that
he
is
a
bit
of
sex
symbol
to
the
armadillo
community
(which
looks
really
weird
now
that
I've
actually
written
that
out).
Thanks
for
writing
in,
Salindor!
If
you've
got
something
to
say
to
Ram
Steed,
mail
me
personally
here
at
the
Journal.
Some
infernal
techmaturgical
machine
will
get
your
message
and
pass
it
on
to
me.

Reader

across
Valoran

answered!
Senior
Summoner
Ralston
Farnsley
commenting
from
the
Institute
of
War
These
are
eventful
times

the
monk's
protest
has
stunned
Ionians
and
incited
the
passions
of
citizens
all
over
Valoran.
We
at
the
Journal
of
Justice
have
many
feelings
about
these
events,
and
although
we
cannot
control
their
outcomes,
I
can
promise
you
that
we
will
continue
providing
you
with
the
most
late-breaking
news
(every
two
weeks)!
&quot;Honestly
I
must
know,
why
does
everyone
even
acknowledge
the
League
when
they
are
all
going
to
be
wiped
out
by
the
Void
?
Our
prophet
Malzahar
has
already
assured
us
that
the
Void
is
coming
and
there
is
nothing
we
can
do
to
stop
it.
I
only
hope
that
my
dedication
to
the
Void
is
taken
notice
and
Malzahar
will
help
save
me
from
the
impending
doom.&quot;
--
profpwn
We
recognize
that
there
is
a
growing
faction
of
Runeterrans
who
either
worry
about
or
welcome
the
Void,
particularly
as
Malzahar
has
gained
popularity
in
the
League.
You
are
free
to
believe
what
you
please,
profpwn,
but
there
have
been
incidents
in
the
past
where
Void
cultists
have
turned
to
violence,
either
against
themselves
or
others.
I
want
you
to
understand
that
this
sort
of
behavior
only
hurts
you
and
those
around
you.
If
there
is
any
truth
to
what
Malzahar
is
saying,
I
would
rather
use
my
magic
to
protect
Runeterra
and
its
citizens,
and
I'd
really
like
to
have
you
on
my
side!
&quot;Several
individuals
have
sought
my
explanation
as
to
why
certain
champions,
on
a
nigh
weekly
basis,
seem
more
willing
to
serve
more
summoners,
requiring
little
to
no
influence
within
the
League
to
gain
access
to
their
powers.
Would
you
mind
providing
the
good
people
of
Valoran
a
general
explanation?&quot;
--
Adjudicator
Fayd
This
is
a
good
point
to
bring
up,
Adjudicator,
thank
you
for
your
assistance
educating
the
younger
summoners.
The
League
of
Legends
serves
many
purposes.
First
and
foremost,
it
acts
as
a
mediator
for
the
city-states
so
that
conflicts
can
be
resolved
without
causing
harm
to
the
world.
However,
the
League
is
also
a
medium
through
which
people
all
over
Runeterra
can
find
common
ground.
People
from
all
corners
of
the
world
attune
their
crystal
screens
to
broadcasts
of
battles
on
the
Fields
of
Justice.
All
champions
admitted
to
the
League
must
make
themselves
available
from
time
to
time

both
for
the
younger
summoners
to
refine
their
arts
and
also
so
that
there
are
always
battles
to
watch.
&quot;The
protests
of
the
Ionian
monk
have
drawn
a
great
deal
of
attention
recently,
turning
the
eyes
of
thousands
to
the
island
city-state.
As
with
many
others,
I
extend
my
sympathies
to
the
Ionians,
but
I
am
curious
as
to
what
actions
the
league
is
considering
about
the
issue.&quot;
--
Cykrus,
Demacian
Summoner
Many
people
share
your
concerns,
Cykrus.
I
cannot
speak
in
an
official
capacity
for
the
League,
but
I
know
that
this
issue
is
being
taken
very
seriously.
The
fact
that
Ionians
felt
the
need
to
protest
so
deeply
moves
the
heart,
but
I
think
its
important
to
remember
that
both
parties
agreed
to
the
terms
of
the
Trial
for
the
Isle
well
beforehand.
At
the
same
time,
the
Shojin
monks
have
long
been
a
beacon
of
wisdom
for
people
all
over
Runeterra.
The
loss
of
even
one
is
a
tragedy
for
thousands.
Unfortunately,
I
think
the
best
we
can
do
is
to
remain
calm
and
hope
for
a
fair
resolution
before
his
magic
runs
out.

Clearing
Obstacles
for
a
Rematch
Noxus
responds
to
the
monks
plight
Quinton
Groat
reporting
from
Noxus
The
tragic
news
of
the
Shojin
monk
,
who
suffers
even
now,
has
shocked
Runeterrans
everywhere.
Flowers
and
well-wishes
have
arrived
at
the
Shojin
Monastery
in
droves.
Public
vigils
have
been
held
in
every
city-state,
and
hundreds
of
letters
have
been
sent
to
the
Institute
of
War
,
pleading
for
intervention
on
behalf
of
the
monk.
This
event
is
heartbreaking,
but
the
amount
of
public
response
generated
for
one
man
is
inspiring.
Today,
in
the
midst
of
all
these
stirred
emotions,
the
Noxian
High
Command
made
a
stunning
announcement.
Chancellor
Malek
Hawkmoon,
the
officer
of
the
Noxian
High
Command
charged
with
overseeing
the
Noxian
presence
in
Ionia
,
gave
this
statement
after
returning
from
an
emergency
conference
in
Noxus.
&quot;After
conferring
with
my
honored
colleagues
in
the
High
Command,
we
have
decided
to
take
this
grievous
situation
into
our
own
hands
and
bring
the
people
of
Valoran
some
peace.
Before
I
go
into
further
detail,
I
would
like
to
address
some
of
the
statements
which
have
been
made
surrounding
our
presence
in
Ionia.&quot;
&quot;It
has
been
said
that
Noxus
is
a
heartless,
imperialistic
war
machine.
It
has
been
implied
that
ours
is
the
seat
of
evil.
I
would
like
to
assure
you,
we
have
families,
homes,
and
children
just
like
anyone
else,
and
our
soldiers
in
Ionia
miss
theirs
dearly.
Our
undertaking
there
has
been
in
the
service
of
the
Ionians.
In
the
wake
of
the
war,
these
southern
provinces
were
left
in
debris
and
disarray.
We
have
spent
our
own
precious
resources
rebuilding
what
was
lost
and
the
'riches
we
now
plunder'
are
far
from
compensation
for
what
we
have
invested
in
these
efforts.&quot;
&quot;Noxus
is
indeed
a
war
machine,
for
this
we
are
proud,
not
ashamed.
Our
sons
put
their
lives
at
stake
in
the
pursuit
of
excellence.
We
respect
those
who
meet
us
on
the
battlefield
too
much
to
treat
them
like
children
or
invalids.
If
you
oppose
Noxian
forces,
you
are
considered
an
equal
opponent,
and
granted
no
quarter,
as
such
is
the
highest
insult
amongst
true
warriors.
It
is
a
disgrace
to
cross
blades
with
an
enemy
and
then
cry
oppression
when
you
are
bested.
Ionia
was
given
the
option
to
surrender
without
violence,
as
are
all
nations
which
the
noble
Noxian
forces
visit.
They
declined,
and
they
lost.
I
wonder
if
the
public
would
react
the
same
way
if
Noxus
requested
repayment
for
the
sons
it
lost
in
the
Ionian
incursion.&quot;
&quot;Now,
as
I
said,
Noxus
has
decided
to
do
what
is
in
its
power
to
bring
peace
to
Valoran,
though
we
have
received
nothing
but
threats
and
slander
since
the
monks
protest
began.
Noxian
blood
is
infused
with
the
scent
of
the
battlefield,
and
Noxians
do
not
hide
behind
politics.
Make
no
mistake,
challenging
the
edicts
of
the
League
of
Legends
is
not
only
unlawful,
but
undermining
to
a
system
which
has
saved
Runeterra
from
ruin.
However,
it
is
our
right
to
grant
Ionia
its
rematch
before
the
proper
term
has
elapsed,
and
we
have
heard
their
plea.
If
Ionia
desires
to
meet
Noxus
on
the
Fields
of
Justice
to
determine
the
fate
of
the
southern
provinces,
then
we
accept
the
terms
and
encourage
them
to
send
their
very
best.&quot;
The
Ionian
Elders
called
an
assembly
immediately
following
Hawkmoon's
speech,
and
they
promised
that
an
official
response
was
soon
to
follow.
The
Master
of
Metal
Mordekaiser
and
Zaun's
Techma-Tune
scene
Jace
P.
Prest
reporting
from
Zaun
Sona
and
Mordekaiser
storm
Zaun
with
their
wildly
popular
band,
Pentakill
Down
in
the
slums
of
Zaun
,
where
the
gutters
glow
green
with
techmaturgical
runoff,
one
can
find
all
manner
of
unsavory
characters:
the
disreputable,
the
disadvantaged,
and
the
disillusioned.
These
are
the
homes
of
back-alley
sorcerers
and
shimmer
addicts,
all
those
whom
critics
say
are
the
byproducts
of
Zaun's
rapid
and
reckless
research
initiatives.
Yet,
despite
(or
perhaps,
because
of)
the
many
negative
images
associated
with
the
Zaunite
slums,
thrill
seekers
frequently
venture
down
to
these
dark
alleys.
They
come
in
larger
numbers
every
week,
and
all
come
for
one
reason:
the
undeniable
allure
of
Zaun's
underground
techmaturgical
music
scene.
With
instruments
powered
by
techmaturgical
amplification,
&quot;Techma-Tune&quot;
musicians
and
their
strange,
wailing
sound
have
been
gaining
ground
in
Zaunian
taverns
for
years.
Those
hip
to
the
scene
gather
in
droves
to
listen
to
the
stylings
of
bands
such
as
&quot;The
Hexbenders&quot;,
&quot;
Yordle
Mothership&quot;,
or
&quot;Tainted
Nexus
&quot;.
For
the
price
of
a
cheap
(and
questionably
concocted)
beverage,
any
traveler
can
shove
for
shoulder-room
to
see
these
talented
groups
perform.
Though
the
Techma-Tune
movement
has
long
been
an
unknown
scene
outside
of
Zaun,
a
new
star
recently
pushed
interest
in
this
genre
of
music
beyond
Zaun's
borders
and
into
the
hearts
and
minds
of
countless
Valorans.
For
the
past
few
months,
Mordekaiser,
the
Master
of
Metal
and
champion
of
the
League,
has
been
storming
the
stages
of
Zaun
with
devastating
effect
as
lead
guitarist
of
the
band
&quot;Pentakill&quot;.
His
dark,
pounding
rhythms
resonate
deeply
with
his
followers.
One
fan
says,
&quot;His
strings
speak
to
the
torment
of
my
existence.&quot;
Another
gushes,
&quot;I
know
that
deep
beneath
that
armor
beats
a
broken
heart
like
mine.
I
love
you,
Mordekaiser!&quot;
We
had
the
privilege
of
speaking
briefly
with
the
League
fighter
and
night
rocker:
JP:
Mordekaiser,
you're
an
enigma
both
in
and
out
of
the
arena.
What
draws
you
away
from
the
Field
of
Justice
to
pursue
this
surprising
side-project?
M:
My
fans.
I
am
drawn
to
their
disease.
JP:
You
mean
their
feverish
love
of
this
Techma-Tune
music?
M:
No.
Pentakill's
popularity
exploded
recently
when
Mordekaiser
appeared
on
stage
with
an
unlikely
co-star:
Sona,
the
League's
darling
diva
!
The
masterful
mistress
of
strings
has
been
regularly
rocking
at
Mordekaiser's
side
in
true
Techma-Tune
style,
clad
in
silver
chains
and
black
finery.
The
two
have
been
busy
releasing
more
captivating
singles
than
ever
before,
with
Sona's
otherworldly
serenades
adding
a
somber
and
captivating
undertone
to
Mordekaiser's
gritty,
powerful
chords.
Though
Sona
was
(understandably)
unavailable
for
comment,
Mordekaiser
has
confirmed
his
desire
to
expand
the
ensemble
further
into
a
full
band:
&quot;I
would
welcome
those
who
would
bring
my
music
further
power.
We
are
known
as
Pentakill,
and
we
shall
rock
as
no
other.
Join
us,
if
you
are
so
bold.&quot;
Hear
Pentakill
perform
their
new
hit,
&quot;Mask
of
Madness&quot;
at
Trogsworth's
Tavern
in
the
heart
of
Zauns
trade
district
any
night
this
week.
Be
warned

it's
standing
room
only
and
the
crowd
can
get
a
little
raucous.
Also,
if
you
yourself
are
a
talented
techma-musician,
gather
your
courage
and
approach
the
stage
afterwards
for
a
personal
audition!

Unstoppable

Friends
and
foes
alike
celebrate
the
Might
of
Demacia
Aria
Breker
commenting
from
Demacia
The
pursuit
of
justice
is
often
a
thankless
job.
When
our
soldiers
are
tirelessly
toiling
on
the
front
lines,
their
benevolence
is
often
met
with
hostility,
even
from
those
who
they
are
trying
to
protect
and
defend.
However,
there
are
often
happier
and
unintended
side
effects
for
those
who
fight
under
Demacia
's
banner.
Garen
,
one
of
Demacia's
League
champions,
now
finds
himself
at
the
center
of
attention
from
citizens
and
summoners
alike
due
to
his
domination
on
the
Fields
of
Justice.
His
battle
prowess
has
brought
widespread
fame
to
both
himself
and
our
grand
city-state.
Eyes
have
turned
to
Garen
as
a
leader,
carrying
his
teams
to
victory
in
the
name
of
Demacia.
Recent
broadcast
matches
featuring
the
Might
of
Demacia
have
drawn
extraordinary
amounts
of
excitement.
Spectators
are
often
found
reveling
in
the
streets
of
almost
every
city-state
after
a
match,
ecstatically
hailing
Garen's
performance
on
the
battlefield.
Fans
describe
Garen
as
&quot;tireless&quot;,
&quot;invincible&quot;,
and
&quot;...almost
as
if
he
never
needs
to
cool
down&quot;.
They
delight
in
the
fact
that
he
is
able
to
silence
enemies
with
the
mighty
swing
of
his
blade,
seemingly
unconstrained
by
the
limitations
that
other
champions
seem
to
face.
The
artistic
have
taken
to
expressing
their
admiration
for
Garen's
skill
by
deluging
the
local
markets
with
paintings
and
songs
reflecting
Demacian
pride.
Children
run
through
the
streets
of
city-states
across
Valoran,
yelling
&quot;DEMACIA!&quot;
much
to
the
chagrin
of
parents
trying
to
instill
their
offspring
with
pride
for
their
own
city-states.
Garen
has
made
quite
an
impression
on
non-supporters
as
well.
Even
those
who
support
other
champions
in
the
League
grudgingly
acknowledge
his
unmistakable
battle
presence.
Opponents
have
been
overheard
calling
him
an
&quot;unstoppable
hurricane&quot;.
Others
swear
that
they
can
almost
see
Garen's
mighty
sword
striking
down
from
above
when
he
claims
a
foe.
Not
all
opinions
are
positive,
however,
with
dissenters
complaining
about
Garen
being
judgmental
on
the
battlefield;
painfully
so.
Some
claim
that
he
seems
overpowered,
as
though
Garen's
fighting
ability
and
battle-tested
skills
were
anything
but
well-earned
from
experience.
Demacian
military
officials
have
taken
note
of
Garen's
exceptional
performance.
Already
the
leader
of
the
Dauntless
Vanguard,
Garen
was
called
upon
to
bring
his
expertise
to
overhaul
Demacia's
military
training.
His
training
program,
called
&quot;Battle
Regimen
for
Ultimate
Soldier
Heroism&quot;,
has
since
been
introduced
to
the
entire
Demacian
army.
It
is
a
well-crafted
conditioning
program
wherein
soldiers
learn
a
variety
of
tactics
and
strategies
employed
by
Garen
on
the
Fields
of
Justice,
including
perseverance,
courage,
and
how
to
strike
decisively
against
our
foes.
Armed
with
the
&quot;Battle
Regimen
for
Ultimate
Soldier
Heroism&quot;
fighting
strategy,
the
enemies
of
justice
have
much
to
fear.
When
the
Demacian
army
descends
upon
challengers,
our
enemies
will
not
stand
a
chance
against
the
whirlwind
of
might.

Who
Didn't
See
This
Coming?
Just
a
few
days
ago,
Calliope
Productions
(located
in
Demacia)
announced
its
latest
musical,
The
Sound
of
Magic
.
Now,
normally
this
reporter
could
not
care
less
about
musicals,
so
why
the
sudden
interest
in
this
one?
Because
this
one
is
helmed
by
the
Gemknight
himself!
The
Sound
of
Magic
isn't
just
a
musical

it's
a
symphonic
bonanza.
This
reporter
was
fortunate
enough
(depending
upon
your
point
of
view)
to
have
been
allowed
into
one
of
the
rehearsals.
The
songs
are
epic,
pretty
much
everyone
is
dancing,
and
the
costumes
are,
well,
outrageous.
I've
never
seen
so
much
frilly
business
in
my
entire
life,
and
the
colors
make
it
look
like
a
flower
bed
threw
up.
Taric
is
the
lead
designer
in
all
of
this,
and
it
shows.
The
Gemknight
actually
deigned
to
give
me
a
few
choice
words:
&quot;I'm
excited
about
this
opportunity.
Musical
theater
has
always,
in
some
way,
been
in
my
blood.
This
production
is
top
notch
and
I
am
honored
to
be
center
stage.
It's
wonderful
that
I
get
to
show
my
fans
a
different
side
of
me.&quot;
It
certainly
is
going
to
be
a
stark
contrast
to
butt-kicking
for
a
living,
that's
for
sure.
Hopefully,
the
prime
performances
won't
interfere
with
Taric's
duties
to
the
League
of
Legends.
If
not,
maybe
he
can
bring
some
singing
and
dancing
to
his
battles

maybe
even
in
one
of
those
frilly
costumes...
as
long
as
they
don't
clash
with
his
hammer!
Little
Poppy's
Big
Vacation
As
both
Bandle
City's
ambassador
to
Demacia
and
as
a
champion
in
the
League
of
Legends,
Poppy
certainly
has
a
lot
of
responsibility.
She
also
has
fame
and
power,
which
give
her
command
over
resources
that
would
make
this
reporter
blush...
and
she's
been
busted
for
abusing
it!
How,
you
might
ask?
How
could
such
a
beloved
Champion,
such
a
sweet
little
yordle,
be
guilty
of
abusing
anything?
By
using
those
resources
to
travel
to
Seafoam,
the
exclusive
resort
on
the
western
coast,
vacation
spot
for
the
wealthy
of
Demacia.
This
reporter
received
a
tip
from
an
anonymous
source
which
revealed
the
following
information.
According
to
her
position,
Poppy
is
given
a
certain
amount
of
money
a
year
to
travel
as
an
ambassador.
This
amount
is
significant,
but
not
enough
for
a
luxury
vacation

but
this
is
exactly
where
the
money
came
from.
The
yordle
Champion
racked
up
room
service
bills,
spa
days,
shopping
sprees
on
the
renowned
Grayhill
Road,
and
a
stay
in
the
penthouse
suite
of
a
five-star
resort
hotel.
The
estimated
cost
of
this
single
vacation
is
far
in
excess
of
the
annual
income
of
most
Valorian
citizens.
Naturally,
neither
Poppy
nor
any
of
her
staff
was
available
for
comment.
Do
I
believe
Poppy
has
a
tough
job?
Yes.
Do
I
believe
she
deserves
time
off
to
enjoy
her
life?
Absolutely.
Do
I
believe
that
she
should
be
allowed
to
take
over-the-top
expensive
vacations
on
the
Demacian
tax-payers
money?
No
way.
So
what
can
we
do
to
hold
officials
like
Poppy
accountable
during
moments
of
financial
mismanagement
like
this?
It
is
the
responsibility
of
you,
the
reader,
to
write
to
the
Demacian
government,
and
let
your
opinions
be
known!
On
the
other
hand,
the
question
many
readers
will
want
an
answer
to:
does
Poppy
take
Whomper
to
the
beach?
This
reporter
thinks
yes.
Dear
Mr.
Steed
Once
again,
I
dig
into
my
mailbag
to
see
what
sort
of
fascinating
letters
you,
the
readers,
have
sent
me.
This
week's
question
is
interesting.
&quot;Dear
Mr.
Steed

Has
Rammus
ever
tried
to
encourage
other
armadillos
to
go
into
the
Kumungu
Jungle
in
hopes
they
might
also
change?&quot;
--
Salindor
the
Summoner
Consider
that
you're
the
only
sentient
armadillo
on
Valoran,
and
you're
a
guy.
What
do
you
think
would
eventually
something
that
you'd
want
in
your
life?
That's
right

a
female
counterpart.
Rammus
has
been
around
the
League
for
a
while
now.
When
asked,
Rammus
had
this
to
say:
&quot;Shut
up.&quot;
Sources
close
to
Rammus
say
that
he
is
unabashed
in
finding
young
female
armadillos
and
trying
to
get
them
to
go
to
the
Plague
Lands.
He's
offered
protection
and
everything.
There
are
some
who
have
gone
with
him,
but
the
rare
magic
that
created
Rammus
in
the
first
place
isn't
likely
to
come
out
and
play
just
because
someone
asks.
It
hasn't
stopped
him
from
trying,
and
he
has
no
lack
of
volunteers,
as
it
appears
that
he
is
a
bit
of
sex
symbol
to
the
armadillo
community
(which
looks
really
weird
now
that
I've
actually
written
that
out).
Thanks
for
writing
in,
Salindor!
If
you've
got
something
to
say
to
Ram
Steed,
mail
me
personally
here
at
the
Journal.
Some
infernal
techmaturgical
machine
will
get
your
message
and
pass
it
on
to
me.

Senior
Summoner
Ralston
Farnsley
commenting
from
the
Institute
of
War
These
are
eventful
times

the
monk's
protest
has
stunned
Ionians
and
incited
the
passions
of
citizens
all
over
Valoran.
We
at
the
Journal
of
Justice
have
many
feelings
about
these
events,
and
although
we
cannot
control
their
outcomes,
I
can
promise
you
that
we
will
continue
providing
you
with
the
most
late-breaking
news
(every
two
weeks)!
&quot;Honestly
I
must
know,
why
does
everyone
even
acknowledge
the
League
when
they
are
all
going
to
be
wiped
out
by
the
Void
?
Our
prophet
Malzahar
has
already
assured
us
that
the
Void
is
coming
and
there
is
nothing
we
can
do
to
stop
it.
I
only
hope
that
my
dedication
to
the
Void
is
taken
notice
and
Malzahar
will
help
save
me
from
the
impending
doom.&quot;
--
profpwn
We
recognize
that
there
is
a
growing
faction
of
Runeterrans
who
either
worry
about
or
welcome
the
Void,
particularly
as
Malzahar
has
gained
popularity
in
the
League.
You
are
free
to
believe
what
you
please,
profpwn,
but
there
have
been
incidents
in
the
past
where
Void
cultists
have
turned
to
violence,
either
against
themselves
or
others.
I
want
you
to
understand
that
this
sort
of
behavior
only
hurts
you
and
those
around
you.
If
there
is
any
truth
to
what
Malzahar
is
saying,
I
would
rather
use
my
magic
to
protect
Runeterra
and
its
citizens,
and
I'd
really
like
to
have
you
on
my
side!
&quot;Several
individuals
have
sought
my
explanation
as
to
why
certain
champions,
on
a
nigh
weekly
basis,
seem
more
willing
to
serve
more
summoners,
requiring
little
to
no
influence
within
the
League
to
gain
access
to
their
powers.
Would
you
mind
providing
the
good
people
of
Valoran
a
general
explanation?&quot;
--
Adjudicator
Fayd
This
is
a
good
point
to
bring
up,
Adjudicator,
thank
you
for
your
assistance
educating
the
younger
summoners.
The
League
of
Legends
serves
many
purposes.
First
and
foremost,
it
acts
as
a
mediator
for
the
city-states
so
that
conflicts
can
be
resolved
without
causing
harm
to
the
world.
However,
the
League
is
also
a
medium
through
which
people
all
over
Runeterra
can
find
common
ground.
People
from
all
corners
of
the
world
attune
their
crystal
screens
to
broadcasts
of
battles
on
the
Fields
of
Justice.
All
champions
admitted
to
the
League
must
make
themselves
available
from
time
to
time

both
for
the
younger
summoners
to
refine
their
arts
and
also
so
that
there
are
always
battles
to
watch.
&quot;The
protests
of
the
Ionian
monk
have
drawn
a
great
deal
of
attention
recently,
turning
the
eyes
of
thousands
to
the
island
city-state.
As
with
many
others,
I
extend
my
sympathies
to
the
Ionians,
but
I
am
curious
as
to
what
actions
the
league
is
considering
about
the
issue.&quot;
--
Cykrus,
Demacian
Summoner
Many
people
share
your
concerns,
Cykrus.
I
cannot
speak
in
an
official
capacity
for
the
League,
but
I
know
that
this
issue
is
being
taken
very
seriously.
The
fact
that
Ionians
felt
the
need
to
protest
so
deeply
moves
the
heart,
but
I
think
its
important
to
remember
that
both
parties
agreed
to
the
terms
of
the
Trial
for
the
Isle
well
beforehand.
At
the
same
time,
the
Shojin
monks
have
long
been
a
beacon
of
wisdom
for
people
all
over
Runeterra.
The
loss
of
even
one
is
a
tragedy
for
thousands.
Unfortunately,
I
think
the
best
we
can
do
is
to
remain
calm
and
hope
for
a
fair
resolution
before
his
magic
runs
out.
