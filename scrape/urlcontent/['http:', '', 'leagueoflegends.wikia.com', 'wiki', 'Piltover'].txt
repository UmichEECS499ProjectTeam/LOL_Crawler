Piltover
is
a
city-state
on
the
northeastern
part
of
Valoran
.

Lore
Piltover,
also
known
as
the
City
of
Progress,
is
the
leading
center
of
ecologically-minded
techmaturgical
research
on
Valoran.
The
city's
great
academies
and
their
contributions
to
science
are
known
across
the
land,
rivaled
only
by
the
eccentric
colleges
found
in
Zaun
.
Strangely,
the
coastal
nation
is
situated
atop
a
relatively
small
mountain
in
a
vast
greenish
marsh.
The
denizens
of
Piltover
appear
to
be
utilizing
the
liquid
and
gases
emitting
from
the
marsh
as
a
viable
source
of
energy
in
order
to
power
the
city.
Culture
The
individuals
who
travel
to
and
wish
to
reside
in
Piltover
have
a
seemingly
unquenchable
thirst
for
knowledge.
This
pursuit
can
lead
them
across
a
variety
of
academic
fields,
be
it
techmaturgy,
medicine,
archaeology,
etc.
The
city's
researchers
clearly
take
great
pleasure
exploring
and
expanding
their
scientific
inquiries.
However,
many
of
them
have
now
turned
their
attention
to
the
current
state
of
conflict
on
Valoran.
Seeing
what
they
consider
an
unacceptable
situation,
the
scientists
and
denizens
of
the
City
of
Progress
have
come
together
to
work
collectively
in
order
to
rectify
the
problems
plaguing
the
continent.
They
firmly
believe
that
science
is
the
key
to
saving
Runeterra.
Another
reason
Piltover
is
referred
to
as
the
City
of
Progress
is
due
to
its
low
crime
rate.
This
hasn't
always
been
the
case;
brigands
and
thieves,
like
Jinx
of
all
sorts
used
to
find
the
city-state
an
ideal
mark
for
plunder,
primarily
due
to
the
valuable
resources
it
imports
to
fuel
its
techmaturgical
research.
Some
even
theorize
that
it
would
have
fallen
long
ago
to
the
chaos
of
organized
crime
if
not
for
Caitlyn,
the
Sheriff
of
Piltover
.
At
a
young
age
Caitlyn
discovered
that
she
possessed
a
natural
gift
for
investigation.
She
also
found
that
she
was
one
of
the
sharpest
shots
in
the
city.
Caitlyn
gained
notoriety
as
she
was
singlehandedly
defeating
crime
in
Piltover.
Jayce,
the
Defender
of
Tomorrow
,
later
became
Piltover's
Sentinel
after
he
singlehandedly
destroyed
the
lab
of
the
Zaunite
scientist,
Viktor,
the
Machine
Herald
.
Though
Piltover
produces
an
abundant
amount
of
techmaturgical
marvels,
the
city's
denizens
strive
to
be
as
environmentally
friendly
as
possible.
They
are
constantly
developing
new
and
improved
methods
for
renewable
energy.
Government
Piltover
has
a
very
empathic
and
progressive
governing
body.
It
is
indicated
that
the
citizens
of
Piltover
collectively
elect
their
representatives,
who
are
referred
to
as
statesmen.
In
order
to
improve
the
city-state's
social
and
environmental
well-being,
statesmen
constantly
strive
to
implement
their
nation's
rapid
scientific
innovations.
Yordle
Academy
of
Science
&
Progress
There
is
a
significant
yordle
population
that
resides
in
Piltover.
Heimerdinger,
the
Revered
Inventor
,
had
an
allure
to
science
that
he
could
not
resist,
and
wanted
to
make
his
mark
on
the
City
of
Progress.
Before
leaving
Bandle
City
he
gathered
like-minded
Yordles
to
join
him
in
his
quest
to
Piltover,
thus
forming
the
backbone
of
the
now
famous
Yordle
Academy
of
Science
&
Progress.
Since
then,
his
academy
has
become
one
of
the
leading
institutions
in
all
of
Valoran.
It
has
pioneered
many
new
scientific
achievements,
delving
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
field
of
techmaturgy.
The
more
interesting
contraptions
Heimerdinger
and
his
colleagues
have
put
together
are
on
permanent
display
at
the
academy,
with
tours
being
granted
nearly
every
day
of
the
week.
Examples
of
Heimerdinger
and
his
academy's
many
inventions
include:
Seven
Lenses
of
Insight
:
one
of
a
kind
goggles
given
to
Master
Yi,
the
Wuju
Bladesman
,
allowing
him
to
see
across
a
wider
range
of
the
spectrum
than
normal
people
see.

Desiring
a
more
suitable
location
to
construct
his
techmaturgical
vehicles,
Heimerdinger
built
a
new
expanded
workshop
outside
his
Yordle
Academy.
[3]
The
workshop,
called
Piltover
Customs,
has
gone
off
to
become
the
most
successful
transportation
customization
and
modification
enterprise
on
Runeterra.
The
co-owner
and
chief
mechanic,
Corki,
the
Daring
Bombardier
,
enjoys
tinkering
with
all
the
hextech
gizmos
that
are
regularly
brought
to
him.
He
and
the
company
provides
a
tour
for
the
shop
by
special
request
only
cause
why
not?
[4]
The
Grandmaster
Explorer
of
Piltover
Wriggle's
Lantern
,
an
artifact
discovered
by
Ezreal
A
large
network
of
the
intricate
tunnels
can
be
found
underneath
Piltover,
and
for
years
they
were
long
thought
to
be
unnavigable.
This
was
until
the
tunnels
were
fully
mapped
out
by
Ezreal,
the
Prodigal
Explorer
.
The
quality
of
his
work
was
so
remarkable
that
the
Piltover
government
purchased
his
maps
and
commissioned
his
services
as
the
city-state's
Grandmaster
Explorer
in
archaeology.
Since
then
Ezreal's
countless
adventures
have
been
romanticized
and
published
by
the
city.
He
also
occasionally
brings
back
many
ancient
artifacts
he
finds
to
Piltover
and
to
the
League
for
further
study.
The
Piltover
Patrol
With
the
goal
of
using
their
combined
knowledge
to
give
aid
to
others
as
quickly
as
possible,
the
city's
officials
created
multiple
search
and
rescue
teams
that
can
be
mobilized
across
Valoran
at
a
moment's
notice.
The
teams,
referred
to
collectively
as
the
Piltover
Patrol,
serve
to
assist
anyone
in
dire
need.
Each
member
is
highly
trained
to
handle
different
levels
of
emergencies.
When
searching
for
missing
individuals
the
rescuers
deploy
the
Piltover
Rescue
Bot,
a
recent
prototype
created
by
the
famed
inventor
Heimerdinger
,
to
hover
over
and
scan
large
areas
of
land.
Should
an
individual
be
found
severely
sick
or
injured,
the
rescue
teams
are
capable
of
swiftly
transporting
them
back
to
Piltover.
The
individual
is
then
treated
as
a
patient
by
the
city-state's
top
medical
staff
and
is
cared
for
around
the
clock.
Relations
with
Zaun
As
the
two
leading
city-states
in
the
development
of
hextech,
Piltover
and
Zaun
have
a
deep
competitive
rivalry,
both
vying
to
be
the
ones
directing
the
future
of
techmaturgy
on
Runeterra.
League
matches
between
the
two
nations
have
a
tendency
to
begin
with
their
champions
exchanging
contemptuous
banter
and
moody
glares.
[5]
Relations
with
Demacia
Though
Piltover
and
Demacia
may
have
their
differences
at
times
and
fight
them
out
on
the
Field
of
Justice
,
the
two
city-states
are
on
relatively
friendly
terms.
Scientists
from
the
City
of
Progress
are
usually
welcomed
inside
Demacia.
However,
should
the
scientists
wish
to
perform
experiments
there,
they
must
first
get
clearance
from
Demacian
officials.
History
Missing
Piltovian
Boy
Found
The
Piltover
Patrol
found
a
young
inventor
from
Piltover
who
was
previously
reported
missing
for
the
last
three
months.
Piltover
officials
mobilized
all
available
rescue
teams
to
recover
the
well-known
14-year-old
prodigy
of
techmaturgy.
He
was
discovered
afflicted
with
a
withering
disease
and
close
to
death
in
the
northern
jungles
of
Kumungu.
The
rescue
team
quickly
transported
the
boy
back
to
the
city-state,
and
he
was
quarantined
to
prevent
spreading
the
disease.
The
medical
staff
raced
to
save
his
life,
though
a
source
within
the
Patrol
described
the
boy's
status
as
worrisome.
The
source
explained
that
the
strange
disease
was
ravaging
the
boy's
body,
and
even
with
the
advanced
state
of
Piltover's
medical
care,
the
disease
was
spreading
too
quickly
for
his
young
body
to
cope
with.
His
name
was
withheld
because
he
was
a
minor.
The
Festival
of
Flight
Tensions
between
Piltover
and
Zaun
renewed
as
the
16th
Festival
of
Flight
race
drew
near,
marking
the
beginning
of
the
annual
Techmaturgical
Conference.
The
city
of
Zaun
had
been
named
victor
of
the
symbolic
event
for
the
last
four
years
running,
though
they
showed
a
great
deal
of
trepidation
towards
the
upcoming
match
after
Piltover
publicly
unveiled
their
new
state-of-the-art
Zeppelin.
While
it's
difficult
to
classify
any
dirigible
as
small,
the
appropriately
named
“Tailwind”
aircraft
was
a
record-breaking
length
of
27
meters.
Not
only
was
it
the
first
Zeppelin
to
meet
such
small
size
constraints,
but
it
also
pioneered
the
utilization
of
Piltoverian
Chrono-Technology.
The
new
prototype
“Chrono-propeller”
engine,
which
received
tremendous
design
contributions
from
fellow
League
Champion
Zilean,
the
Chronokeeper
,
was
rumored
to
manipulate
time
itself
to
reach
speeds
that
would
otherwise
be
impossible
under
Valoran’s
constantly
changing
atmospheric
conditions.
The
Zeppelin
would
be
piloted
in
the
race
by
Janna,
the
Storm's
Fury
,
who
was
once
one
of
Zaun’s
most
promising
mage
talents
before
defecting
from
the
city-state
several
years
ago.
[6]
Piltover
Wins
the
Annual
Zeppelin
Race
Janna’s
record-breaking
Zeppelin
"Tailwind"
defeated
the
Zaunite
flagship
"Lead
Zeppelin"
at
the
annual
Techmaturgical
Conference
in
Piltover.
Zaun's
"Lead
Zeppelin"
had
maintained
a
strong
lead
from
the
race’s
start
in
Piltover.
The
Zaunite
flagship,
a
powerhouse
of
black
metal
and
Zaunite
techmaturgy,
had
claimed
victory
at
the
Conference
for
the
past
four
years.
As
the
two
Zeppelins
crossed
the
Bluewind
Bay,
however,
Tailwind’s
chrono-propeller
engine
allowed
the
craft
to
navigate
through
the
bay's
storms
utterly
unfettered,
securing
Piltover’s
victory.
The
Hexplosives
Expert
Ziggs,
the
Hexplosives
Expert
Some
time
after
Ziggs,
the
Hexplosives
Expert
,
accidentally
blew
up
the
wall
of
the
Academy,
Zaunite
agents
infiltrated
Piltover
and
kidnapped
the
yordles.
The
Piltover
military
tracked
the
hostages
to
a
Zaunite
prison.
They
tried
to
break
them
free
but
to
no
avail,
their
weapons
proved
useless
against
their
fortified
walls.
Ziggs
then
came
to
the
scene
with
his
new
and
improved
bombs
he
lovingly
calls
"hexplosives".
Ziggs
used
his
most
powerful
bomb,
the
Mega
Inferno
Bomb,
to
destroy
the
reinforced
walls.
Once
the
smoke
diminished
he
lashed
out
at
the
guards
with
an
array
of
unique
hexplosives,
broke
the
yordles'
cell
and
led
them
back
to
Piltover.
The
Defender
of
Tomorrow
Jayce,
the
Defender
of
Tomorrow
A
friendly
visit
from
the
Zaunite
scientist,
Viktor,
the
Machine
Herald
,
quickly
turned
into
an
all-out
assault
of
Jayce's
lab
in
a
successful
attempt
at
stealing
the
arcane
crystal.
Piltover
officials
refused
to
attack
Zaun
to
prevent
the
thievery
from
escalating
into
an
all-out
war
between
the
two
city-states.
With
no
response
from
the
officials,
Jayce
chose
to
seclude
himself
inside
his
lab.
Rumor
spread
he
was
developing
a
powerful
weapon
for
an
assault
against
the
Zaunite
scientist.
After
many
restless
day
and
nights,
Jayce
finally
made
himself
public
again,
carrying
with
him
the
supposedly
rumored
weapon,
the
Mercury
Hammer.
With
this,
Jayce
assaulted
Viktor's
lab,
defeated
him
and
his
acolytes
and
destroyed
the
crystal.
On
his
return,
the
citizens
of
Piltover
showered
him
with
adoration.
But
with
his
actions
he
knew
that
Zaun
would
soon
act
again
and
try
to
wreak
havoc
in
Piltover.
So
he
made
a
solemn
vow
to
defend
all
of
Piltover
from
any
danger
that
comes.
Get
Jinxed!
Jinx
bombards
the
city
Ever
since,
Piltover
has
been
known
as
the
City
of
Progress
for
the
many
technological
advancements
it
has
made,
but
when
the
mad
girl,
Jinx
,
had
first
attacked
the
city,
its
progress
had
stopped.
Now
the
city
is
a
cesspool
of
chaos,
buildings
crumbling,
people
dying,
painted
animals
running
rampant
and
the
city
in
constant
gunfire.
Piltover's
Finest,
Sheriff
Caitlyn
and
Vi
,
have
been
trying
to
track
her
down
but
to
no
avail.
As
Jinx's
rampage
escalated,
the
Sheriff
had
declared
a
city-wide
manhunt
for
her.
Jinx
responds
to
this
by
marking
the
treasury
with
a
challenge
to
Vi,
telling
that
she
would
attack
the
place
during
the
time
and
date
she
had
written
there.
When
the
time
had
come,
she
did
turn
up
and
began
to
wreak
havoc.
Vi
began
chasing
her,
smashing
through
every
wall
she
comes
through,
and,
finally,
when
Jinx
was
cornered,
Jinx
let
loose
a
barrage
of
rockets,
destroying
the
building.
When
the
officers
had
awoken,
all
the
gold
still
remained
and
Jinx
had
spelled
out
something
in
the
sky
using
the
city's
lights,
"YOU'LL
NEVER
CATCH
ME!".
