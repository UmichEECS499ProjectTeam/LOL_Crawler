Jarvan
IV
Galio
A
half-breed
born
from
the
union
between
dragon
and
human,
Shyvana
searched
all
her
life
for
belonging.
Persecution
forged
her
into
a
brutal
warrior,
and
those
who
dare
stand
against
Shyvana
face
the
fiery
beast
lurking
just
beneath
her
skin.
Dragonkind
considered
Shyvana's
impure
blood
an
abomination,
and
she
spent
her
youth
pursued
relentlessly
by
one
cruel
drake.
Constantly
on
the
run,
she
and
her
father,
an
outcast
dragon,
never
knew
a
lasting
home.
A
brutal
reflection
of
countless
battles,
Shyvana
grew
hateful
and
savage.
After
years
of
strife,
her
father
finally
fell
to
the
other
dragon,
but
not
before
gravely
wounding
his
foe.
Furious
with
grief,
Shyvana
pursued
her
father’s
murderer
as
he
fled
north
to
recover.
There
she
encountered
a
group
of
humans
on
the
trail
of
the
same
drake.
Though
the
men
looked
upon
her
in
fear,
their
leader
approached
Shyvana
peacefully.
He
introduced
himself
as
Jarvan
IV
,
the
Prince
of
Demacia
,
and
offered
to
aid
Shyvana
in
her
quest
for
vengeance.
Together
they
hunted
down
and
confronted
the
vicious
dragon
that
had
slain
her
father.
Shyvana
did
not
expect
the
men
to
survive,
but
in
the
clash
of
fire
and
steel,
Jarvan
and
his
men
fought
with
strength
she
had
never
believed
humans
to
possess.
The
ironclad
warriors
drove
their
foe
into
submission,
and
Shyvana
struck
the
final
blow,
tearing
the
beast's
heart
from
its
body.
Inspired
by
her
ferocity,
Jarvan
offered
her
a
place
in
the
ranks
of
his
elite
guard.
Shyvana
could
still
see
fear
in
the
eyes
of
his
men,
but
she
longed
for
a
true
home.
Trusting
Jarvan's
word,
she
accepted
his
offer
and
now
serves
as
a
Demacian
warrior.
Though
her
human
allies
admire
her
power,
they
keep
their
distance.
Shyvana
strives
to
repay
the
prince’s
kindness
with
the
power
of
the
dragon
within,
but
she
cannot
help
but
wonder
if
the
humans
are
right
to
fear
her.
"I
have
proven
my
might
to
dragonkind—what
challenge
shall
humans
pose?"
―
Shyvana
Half-Dragons
are
the
forbidden
scions
of
humans
and
shape-shifting
dragons.
There
have
been
few
in
the
world,
as
they
are
typically
hunted
down
by
their
draconian
relatives.
The
scarce
and
reclusive
dragons
left
on
Runeterra
find
it
disgusting
to
mix
their
blood
with
the
frivolous
and
violent
lesser
races.
However,
there
are
those
who
become
fascinated
with
humans,
such
as
Shyvana's
father.
It
was
to
Prince
Jarvan
IV's
surprise
when
his
hunt
led
him
to
a
legendary
young
half-dragon.
She
wept
over
the
dead,
mutilated
corpse
of
her
father,
murdered
for
her
existence.
Something
in
Jarvan
was
moved
by
Shyvana's
plight.
Together
they
plotted
revenge
against
the
mighty
dragon
responsible.
The
assault
cost
the
Demacian
Prince
many
men,
and
nearly
his
life,
but
ultimately
Shyvana
and
he
prevailed.
The
experience
changed
the
both
of
them.
Shyvana
lost
her
place
in
the
world,
left
alone
to
be
hunted
by
those
dragons
who
discovered
her
existence.
Because
of
what
he'd
seen,
Jarvan
lost
his
taste
for
the
hunt
and
wished
to
return
home
as
protector
of
his
people.
Jarvan
IV,
as
Crown
Prince
of
Demacia,
offered
Shyvana
a
place
as
a
noble
warrior
in
the
ranks
of
the
elite
guard.
Out
of
gratitude
and
necessity,
she
accepted.
Since
their
return
to
Demacia,
Shyvana
has
proven
herself
to
be
a
fierce
and
powerful
soldier.
She
blends
her
fiery
draconian
blood
with
her
adopted
principles
of
justice.
She
revels
in
the
power
she
now
feels
in
the
human
world
and
there
are
few
who
do
not
quake
before
her
in
combat.
However,
by
and
large
there
remains
only
one
place
for
glorious
battle.
When
Jarvan
joined
the
League
of
Legends
,
it
wasn't
long
before
Shyvana
answered
the
call
as
well.
"I
have
the
blood
of
dragons
in
my
veins.
I
am
fear
to
all
who
oppose
me."
―
Shyvana
There
are
those
few
dragons
in
Runeterra
who
have
mastered
the
intense
magical
energies
that
course
through
their
unique
anatomies,
evolving
into
an
elusive
Celestial
Dragon.
These
powerful
and
enigmatic
creatures
spend
most
of
their
time
hidden
away
from
the
lands
of
men.
However,
there
are
those
who
find
themselves
drawn
to
civilization
and
who
take
on
human
forms
to
immerse
themselves
in
the
world
of
humans.
Occasionally,
one
finds
itself
drawn
to
the
spirit
of
a
human
and
they
have
relations.
Sometimes,
in
the
slimmest
of
odds,
the
union
will
bear
fruit
and
that
offspring
will
be
one
of
the
few
half-dragons
to
have
graced
Runeterra.
Shyvana
is
one
such
creature,
born
to
a
simple
Demacian
farm-girl
and
her
Celestial
Dragon
father.
Left
to
be
raised
by
her
mother,
her
oddities
were
something
that
couldn't
be
hidden
from
her
community,
though
she
was
protected
by
her
family.
Once
her
family
had
perished
in
disaster,
she
was
left
alone
for
the
first
time
-
truly
alone.
Shyvana
quickly
became
an
outsider
and
it
wasn't
long
before
the
community's
fear
began
to
put
her
in
danger.
Facing
mortal
danger
at
the
business
end
of
an
angry
mob,
she
was
rescued
by
the
traveling
noble,
Jarvan
Lightshield
.
The
noble
was
a
man
who
strangely
knew
exactly
what
she
was
and
took
her
under
his
wing.
It
wasn't
long
before
she
was
offered
a
chance
to
use
her
natural
skills
in
the
service
of
Demacia,
as
Jarvan
initiated
her
as
one
of
the
elite
guard.
Following
Jarvan
into
the
League
of
Legends
was
only
natural.
Shyvana
is
a
fierce
warrior,
with
the
blood
of
one
of
the
most
powerful
magical
predators
in
all
creation
flowing
through
her
veins.
Unlike
some
of
her
fellows,
she
is
a
subdued
personality
-
somber,
cool,
and
collected.
However,
when
the
moment
strikes,
her
draconian
heritage
manifests
and
there
are
few
that
can
stare
her
in
the
eyes
and
not
feel
the
primal
urge
to
flee.
"By
the
blood
of
my
father,
I
will
end
you!"

Shyvana's
Comic
Announcement
made
by
Average
Gatsby:
Eventually
everyone
has
one
of
those
moments
where
life
throws
them
a
curve
ball
and
they
learn
that
you
sometimes
meet
people
who
are
full
of
surprises.
So,
when
we
first
ran
into
Shyvana,
the
Half-Dragon,
suffice
to
say
we
were
rather
taken
aback
indeed
when
we
saw
her
actually
transform
into
a
dragon.
So
unless
you're
a
truly
incorrigible
herpetophobic,
we're
confident
that
you'll
find
that
not
all
surprises
have
to
be
unpleasant.

Announcement
made
in
the
Mechanics
Preview
by
Average
Gatsby:
For
this
mechanics
preview,
we
wanted
to
focus
less
on
the
individual
abilities
of
our
upcoming
champion
and
talk
about
the
skillset
and
character
flow
of
Shyvana,
the
Half
Dragon,
as
a
whole.
Shyvana
is
a
melee
champion
that
heavily
rewards
aggression.
She
does
so
by
utilizing
a
modified
Fury*
resource
that
accrues
anytime
Shyvana
lands
an
auto-attack.
Once
her
Fury*
is
full,
she
can
unleash
it
to
transform
into
a
dragon,
giving
her
substantial
buffs,
ability
enhancements
and
some
upfront
damage.
While
in
dragon
form,
Shyvana's
Fury*
is
slowly
consumed,
though
she
can
continue
auto-attacking
to
extend
the
duration
of
the
Dragon
From
and
maximize
her
damage
output
with
each
use.
It's
also
worth
mentioning
that
Shyvana's
ultimate
has
no
cooldown,
but
can
only
be
used
when
her
reserve
of
Fury*
is
full.
The
right
set
of
circumstances
can
allow
a
skilled
player
to
transform
much
more
often
than
other
would
otherwise
be
possible.
In
addition,
all
of
Shyvana's
abilities
also
have
benefits
that
trigger
when
she
auto-attacks.
This
is
to
differentiate
her
from
the
"melee
caster"
paradigm
embodied
by
some
other
characters,
making
her
play
somewhere
between
an
Attack
Damage
carry
and
a
fighter.
Simply
put,
Shyvana
is
for
players
who
like
any
of
the
following:
Offensive,
aggressive
playstyles
Melee
carries
or
fighters
The
idea
of
being
a
super-rad
dragon
We
think
this
wantonly
aggressive
playstyle
is
something
we
haven't
seen
previously
on
the
Fields
of
Justice.
It's
an
exciting
opportunity
for
players
to
experience
a
new
way
to
play
League
of
Legends.
Note:
Fury
was
originally
mislabeled
as
"Dragon’s
Blood".
