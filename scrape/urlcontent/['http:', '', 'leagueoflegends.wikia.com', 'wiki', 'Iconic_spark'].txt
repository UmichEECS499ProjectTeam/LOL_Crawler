Notes
Ionic
Spark
was
one
of
the
few
items
that
offered
both
attack
speed
and
health
along
with
Trinity
Force
and
the
old
version
of
Zeke's
Herald
.
The
chain
damage
did
not
trigger
spell
vamp
.
The
item
was
removed
because
so
few
champions
could
use
it
effectively
due
to
its
combination
of
stats.
It
was
replaced
with
Statikk
Shiv
and
the
buffed
Tiamat
.
