Leona,
the
Radiant
Dawn
is
a
champion
in
League
of
Legends
.
[1]
Abilities
Sunlight
Leona's
spells
charge
any
enemy
unit
damaged
with
Sunlight
for
3.
5
seconds.
When
allied
champions
deal
any
damage
to
those
targets
they
consume

additional
magic
damage.
This
additional
damage
is
counted
as
the
ally's
damage
and
it
will
benefit
from
their
magic
penetration.
Leona
is
unable
to
activate
the
additional
damage
herself.
Ability
Details
Sunlight
is
an
on-spell
effect
.
Applies
spell
effects
as
a
single
target
ability.
Spell
vamp
is
fully
applied.
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
will
apply
a
35%
slow.
Spell
shields
will
block
the
application
of
the
debuff,
but
will
not
block
the
detonation
of
a
mark.
Additional
Information:
The
damage
dealt
by
Sunlight's
mark
is
credited
to
the
allied
champion,
not
Leona.
As
such,
the
magic
damage
will
benefit
from
their
magic
penetration
and
will
apply
any
spell
effects
they
have,
including
spell
vamp
.
Sunlight
does
not
stack.
Further
applications
of
the
debuff
only
refresh
the
timer.
Sunlight
has
a
hidden
passive
which
causes
champions
wearing
sunglasses
to
take
1
less
damage
from
Sunlight,
such
as
Vayne
.
This
extends
to
champion
skins
as
well,
even
if
their
default
skin
does
not
normally
wear
sunglasses,
such
as
Surfer
Singed
.
