Skill
usage
Arctic
Assault
can
be
cast
through
walls,
making
this
ability
a
great
escape
and
chasing
mechanism.
Arctic
Assault
will
also
stop
if
she
comes
into
contact
with
an
enemy
champion.
This
is
a
great
way
to
spot
out
stealth
champions
such
as
Teemo
or
Twitch
.
That's
also
useful
to
speed
up
jungle
clear
times.
When
ganking
or
in
smaller
fights,
try
not
to
initiate
with
Arctic
Assault
if
possible.
Save
it
for
chasing
down
an
enemy
who
tries
to
get
away
with
Flash
or
other
escapes.
Use
Permafrost
after
you
land
a
basic
attack
or
charge
in
with
Arctic
Assault
.
The
slow
makes
it
easier
for
Sejuani
and
her
allies
to
pick
off
the
enemy.
Proper
usage
of
your
ultimate
Glacial
Prison
is
vital.
As
Glacial
Prison
applies
Frost
to
enemies
hit
in
a
large
area,
you
can
initiate
fights
by
combining
it
with
Arctic
Assault
and
Permafrost
.
After
your
stun,
enemies
will
still
be
nearly
immobile,
giving
your
team
a
few
seconds
of
time
in
which
to
crush
key
targets.
Remember
that
Glacial
Prison
explodes
at
the
end
of
its
range
if
it
does
not
collide
with
an
enemy
champion.
This
actually
gives
it
additional
range
and
capabilities
if
you
wish
to
make
use
of
of
it.
Sometimes
you
can
purposely
avoid
hitting
a
specific
champion
to
hit
more
targets
overall.
Although
this
wil
result
with
only
slowing
champions
and
not
stunning
them.
Your
Permafrost
has
a
rather
impressive
1000
range.
Consider
waiting
for
your
opponent
to
use
an
escape
ability
before
using
it
(As
long
as
Frost
is
applied
for
up
to
3
seconds,
it
can
be
used
from
afar).
This
allows
you
to
close
a
gap
when
they
least
expect
it.
Your
Glacial
Prison
can
also
be
used
to
close
the
gap,
due
to
its
similar
ranged
capabilities.
Build
usage
Building
both
Frozen
Mallet
and
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
at
the
same
time
is
not
recommended.
Frozen
Mallet
is
typically
the
better
choice,
with
a
higher
slow
and
bonus
health,
however
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
may
be
taken
if
you
expect
the
need
of
another
AoE
slow
source
and
higher
all
around
damage.
Buying
a
Sunfire
Cape
allows
for
continuous
damage
on
enemies,
used
in
combination
with
slows
it
can
rack
up
a
lot
of
damage
over
a
period
of
time.
It
also
improves
her
Flail
of
the
Northern
Winds
ability
due
its
health
scaling,
adding
up
to
81
total
bonus
damage
on
a
single
cast
to
enemies
suffering
from
Permafrost
.
Much
like
Leona
,
building
Sejuani
as
a
full
AP
caster
is
not
ideal
due
to
her
moderate
AP
ratios
(
they
are
however,
superior
to
Leona
's)
.
Thus,
in
a
damage-oriented
build,
Liandry's
Torment
is
probably
the
most
important
item
to
build,
along
with
Abyssal
Scepter
,
both
offer
good
defensive
stats
and
Liandry's
Torment
damage
can
quickly
add
up
thanks
to
Sejuani's
large
amount
of
CC
will
allow
her
to
trigger
the
improved
damage
of
Liandry's
Torment
.
The
items
Talisman
of
Ascension
,
Randuin's
Omen
,
and
Frozen
Heart
could
very
easily
be
considered
core
items
for
Sejuani.
Talisman
of
Ascension
provides
one
of
the
most
powerful
active
effects
an
item
can
give
on
top
of
generous
health
and
mana
regeneration
,
CDR
and
health
.
However,
Ancient
Coin
and
Nomad's
Medallion
passives
are
not
very
useful
for
a
jungler.
Randuin's
Omen
provides
another
extremely
powerful
active,
as
well
as
many
of
the
stats
Sejuani
needs,
and
an
anti-dps
passive
on-being-hit.
Frozen
Heart
may
be
the
most
important
item
for
Sejuani,
as
it
provides
a
very
large
amount
of
armor
and,
more
importantly,
CDR
,
which
helps
deal
with
her
very
long
cooldowns,
on
top
of
an
extremely
powerful
defensive
aura.
Guardian
Angel
is
also
a
reasonable
item
for
Sejuani
late
game
given
that
her
role
in
team
fights
is
generally
to
charge
straight
into
the
enemy
and
hamper
them
with
her
AoE
skills.
Ultimately,
CDR
is
Sejuani's
most
important
statistic
to
itemize
or
build
for.
Building
an
early
Glacial
Shroud
and
Kindlegem
after
GP10
items
is
arguably
Sejuani's
best
early
build.
Also
consider
playing
with
a
team
that
can
allow
you
to
take
the
second
and/or
third
blue
golem.
This
is
ideal
for
before
you
gain
the
CDR
required
to
combo
your
abilities
efficiently.
Consider
getting
a
Spirit
Visage
after
getting
Warmog's
Armor
,
as
not
only
it
gives
you
a
massive
20%
CDR,
but
increases
your
HP
regen,
and
gives
you
a
big
MR
boost.
Because
of
her
early
game
weakness,
buying
wards
is
crucial
to
protect
both
you
and
your
jungle.
Although
rushing
a
Sightstone
is
not
recommended,
as
it
will
delay
your
build,
try
and
grab
one
early
game
to
protect
your
jungle
entrances.
If
you
are
extremely
fed,
proceed
to
upgrade
the
item
to
Ruby
Sightstone
as
it
will
give
you
1
extra
ward
and
increase
your
W
dps.
You
can
also
ask
your
top
and
bot
to
ward
those
jungle
entrances,
leaving
you
to
cover
the
near
mid
lane
entrances.
Iceborn
Gauntlet
synergizes
well
with
Flail
of
the
Northern
Winds
,
as
upon
activating
it
you
can
land
a
double
enhanced
autoattack,
that
will
deal
twice
as
much
damage
and
also
slow
any
nearby
enemies,
keeping
them
in
range.
Sejuani
's
passive
stacks
with
Boots
of
Swiftness
to
provide
a
scaling
reduction
in
the
potency
of
slows
from
32.5%
(at
level
one)
to
43.75%
(at
level
17).
You
can
reduce
the
potency
of
slows
even
more
by
having
the
Relentless
defense
mastery.
Having
both
of
these
on
Sejuani
makes
the
Slow
Potency
Reduction
scale
from
42.625%
(At
level
one)
to
52.1875%
(at
level
17).
Jungling
Your
skill
order
should
be
Flail
of
the
Northern
Winds
,
Arctic
Assault
,
Permafrost
,
then
max
Permafrost
.
After
that,
max
Flail
of
the
Northern
Winds
or
Arctic
Assault
,
depending
on
your
preference
or
your
team's
needs.
Grab
Glacial
Prison
whenever
you
can.
The
first
point
in
Flail
of
the
Northern
Winds
is
necessary
to
get
your
jungle
started,
as
it
has
the
highest
Area
of
Effect
damage
on
level
1.
To
clear
a
jungle
camp,
DO
NOT
start
with
Arctic
Assault
.
Instead
activate
Flail
of
the
Northern
Winds
to
apply
Frost
to
all
the
monster
in
the
camp.
Shortly
before
Frost
is
about
to
expire,
refresh
its
duration
with
Permafrost
to
do
a
sizable
amount
of
damage.
Save
Arctic
Assault
for
leaving
the
camp,
or
escaping
a
possible
gank.
When
choosing
whether
to
max
Flail
of
the
Northern
Winds
or
Arctic
Assault
second,
try
to
evaluate
what
you
need
more.
If
you
need
damage,
max
Flail
of
the
Northern
Winds
first.
If
you
want
to
roam
and
chase
more
effectively,
max
Arctic
Assault
for
the
Cooldown
Reduction
from
leveling
it.

Countering
Sejuani
is
an
extremely
potent
ganker
once
she
hits
level
4.
Refrain
from
boldly
pushing
your
lane
if
you
believe
she's
reached
this
level.
Even
before
level
4,
her
ganks
can
still
hurt,
so
always
have
a
ward
in
place
to
prevent
getting
jumped.
Once
she
has
a
few
levels
going
for
her
Sejuani
is
a
very
proficient
farmer,
so
it
would
be
wise
to
try
and
stop
her
from
farming
too
much
throughout
the
game,
or
she
may
become
extremely
difficult
to
deal
with/kill
later
on.
Glacial
Prison
is
a
very
powerful
initiation
ability,
and
if
multiple
teammates
are
caught
in
it,
it
could
prove
a
difficult
recovery.
Avoid
bunching
up
while
she
is
near
and/or
making
yourself
an
easy
target.
Once
Sejuani
catches
you
alone,
escape
is
nearly
impossible.
Avoid
invading
her
jungle
if
she's
made
herself
difficult
to
kill
and
you
are
unsure
of
her
position.
Also,
avoid
pushing
lanes
by
yourself
if
you
are
not
certain
you
can
kill
her
or
get
away,
or
of
her
location.
Sejuani
is
extremely
weak
at
dueling
other
champions
in
the
early
game,
but
will
become
extremely
strong
if
she
doesn't
fall
behind.
Due
to
being
one
of
the
most
powerful
champions
in
the
lategame,
it's
important
if
your
team
can
focus
on
shutting
her
down.
Try
counter
jungling
and
playing
safe
so
she
can't
gank
lanes
successfully.
Coordinate
strategies
to
keep
her
behind
without
farm.
Take
advantage
of
her
glaring
early
game
weaknesses.
