the
buff
Crest
of
Crushing
Wrath

grants

health
and
mana

Abilities
Vilemaw
has
a
powerful
AoE
conical
pull
attack
and
a
stacking
debuff
that
reduces
your
armor
and
magic
resistance
by
0.5
(estimate).
The
debuff
caps
at
60
stacks
(total
reduction
is
30).
Being
hit
by
its
melee
basic
attacks
will
apply
one
stack,
while
his
long
ranged
attacks
apply
4
stacks
and
his
short
ranged
AoE
slam
attacks
will
apply
15
stacks.
Trivia
Vilemaw
has
an
easter
egg
where
if
three
champions
dance
in
front
of
him,
Vilemaw
will
dance
along
with
them.
His
dance
is
a
reference
to
"The
Carlton
Dance"
from
The
Fresh
Prince
of
Bel-Air.
A
side-by-side
comparison
can
be
seen
here
.
The
skeleton
of
a
dragon
can
be
seen
near
Vilemaw.
It
was
confirmed
to
be
the
former
most
powerful
neutral
monster
Ebonmaw
(the
dragon
on
Twisted
Treeline)
by
Tamat
in
a
forum
post
found
here
,
but
Kitae
says
that
this
is
merely
a
tribute
and
not
canon.
Another
tribute
to
Ebonmaw
is
Vilemaw
having
the
word
"maw"
in
his
name.
[1]
The
mythical
spider
god
mentioned
in
Elise's
lore
is
Vilemaw
.
It
was
confirmed
by
Kitae
here
.
She
however
also
said
that
as
well
as
Baron
Nashor
,
Vilemaw
is
supremely
more
powerful
in
the
actual
lore
than
in
the
game,
far
more
poweful
than
any
champion
-
or
a
lot
of
champions
-
alone,
much
like
an
actual
god.
Upon
defeat,
Vilemaw
doesn't
simply
die
-
instead,
he
retreats
back
into
his
lair
in
the
background.
This
may
be
a
reference
to
the
giant
spider,
Shelob,
from
Lord
of
the
Rings
who,
when
defeated
by
Sam,
crawls
back
into
her
cave
and
is
never
mentioned
again.
When
you
consume
Vilemaw
as
Nunu
you
will
get
the
Lizard
buff.
This
is
the
only
way
to
get
the
buff
as
Nunu
on
the
Twisted
Treeline.
