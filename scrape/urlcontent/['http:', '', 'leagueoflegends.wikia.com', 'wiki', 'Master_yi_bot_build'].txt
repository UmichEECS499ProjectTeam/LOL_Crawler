Master
Yi,
the
Wuju
Bladesman
is
a
champion
in
League
of
Legends
.
[1]
Abilities
Double
Strike
Every
4th
consecutive
autoattack,
Master
Yi
strikes
twice.
The
second
attack
uses
an
attack
damage
modifier
of
50%,
but
applies
on-hit
effects
fully
and
can
critically
strike.
Double
Strike's
counter
resets
if
Master
Yi
has
not
autoattacked
in
the
last
4
seconds.
Ability
Details
Double
Strike
is
an
on-hit
effect
.
Both
attacks
will
trigger
on-attack
effects
and
on-hit
effects
.
Both
attacks
are
classified
as
a
melee
.
Critical
strike
chance
is
calculated
on
each
attack
individually.
The
second
attack's
critical
strike
will
deal
damage
based
on
50%
of
Master
Yi's
AD
.
Both
attacks
can
miss
and
be
dodged
.
Aegis
Protection
will
only
block
the
first
hit.
Riposte
will
block
both
hits.
Spell
shields
will
not
block
the
effect.
Additional
Information:
The
first
attack
functions
as
the
trigger
of
Double
Strike's
on-hit
effect
and
resets
Double
Strike's
counter.
The
second
attack
will
generate
a
stack
of
Double
Strike
if
completed.
As
such,
continuous
attacking
will
net
an
activation
of
Double
Strike
on
every
3rd
attack.
If
the
target
dies
to
the
first
hit,
Double
Strike's
counter
is
still
reset.

Master
Yi
becomes
untargetable
and
leaps
to
strike
up
to
4
enemies,
dealing
physical
damage
to
each
and
dealing
additional
damage
to
minions
and
monsters.
Each
bounce
will
target
the
nearest
enemy
that
has
not
yet
been
damaged.
Master
Yi
re-appears
at
the
initial
target's
location
after
the
effect
ends.
Alpha
Strike
can
critically
strike,
dealing
additional
physical
damage
equal
to
60%
AD
.
Basic

the
cooldown
of
Alpha
Strike
by
1
second.

Ability
Details
Alpha
Strike
is
a
targeted
blink
that
bounces
to
nearby
enemies
before
arriving.
Applies
spell
effects
as
an
area
of
effect
ability.
Spell
vamp
is
reduced
to
one-third
effectiveness.
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
will
apply
a
15%
slow.
Spell
shields
will
block
the
ability.
Additional
Information:
If
the
primary
target
dies
or
becomes
invulnerable
as
Master
Yi
finishes
Alpha
Strike
,
he
will
appear
at
the
cast
location.
Alpha
Strike
counts
as
movement
for
the
purpose
of
Statikk
Shiv
Alpha
Strike's
critical
damage
component
is
effectively
0.
6
×
the
bonus
damage
a
critical
strike
would
grant
to
a
basic
attack.
This
cuts
the
normal
+100%
down
to
+60%;
with
Infinity
Edge
,
it
would
instead
cut
+150%
down
to
+90%.
The
total
bonus
damage
is
showed
in
the
ability.
Alpha
Strike
cooldown
reduction
counts
up
when
attacking
Turrets
,
but
not
when
under
the
effect
of
Blind
.
The
damage
is
calculated
after
Master
Yi
becomes
targetable,
meaning
that
bonus
AD
from
auras
will
be
factored.
This
means
he
can
also
take
tower
aggro
from
the
damage
dealt.
Neutral
minions
will
reset
to
their
idle
positions
when
Master
Yi
is
untargetable,
but
they
do
not
reset
their
health.
Sword
of
the
Divine
does
not
count
critical
strikes
sourced
from
abilities
toward
its
3-crit
limit,
meaning
Alpha
Strike
will
critically
strike
against
up
to
4
units
and
still
have
100%
critical
strike
chance
for
a
second-or-so
thereafter.
It
is
possible
to
cast
Summoner
Spells
while
using
Alpha
Strike
,
such
as
Smite
.
Alpha
Strike
can
be
used
to
dodge
and
avoid
skillshots
and
area
of
effect
abilities.
Some
dodgeable
spells
involve
the
damage
instance
of
Time
Bomb
,
Absolute
Zero
and
Requiem
.
Being
untargetable
extends
to
allies
and
will
dodge
e.g.
Wish
.
Since
V3.13
,
Alpha
Strike
can
be
used
to
dodge
targeted
abilities.
Alpha
Strike
does
not
hit
enemies
in
stealth
or
in
the
Fog
of
War.
If
Alpha
Strike
is
used
by
Master
Yi,
even
with
0%
critical
strike
chance,
it
will
activate
Frenzy
.

Additional
Information:
As
a
channeled
ability,
it
can
be
interupted
by
any
form
of
hard-CC
.
Healing
amount
depends
on
the
amount
of
health
while
the
healing
tick
occurs,
not
at
the
casting
point
of
health.
As
such,
Master
Yi
heals
less
per
second
as
his
current
health
increases.
Although
the
tooltip
show
that
he
heals
each
second
while
channeling,
the
healing
tick
occurs
every
0.
5
seconds
instead,
but
heals
for
half
of
the
amount
shown
in
the
tooltip
with
a
total
of

ticks.

apply
other

Ability
Details
Highlander
is
a
self-targeted
buff
.
It
also
passively
reduces
the
remaining
cooldowns
of
Master
Yi's
basic
abilities
whenever
he
scores
a
kill
or
assist.
Additional
Information:
Highlander
is
one
of
few
abilities
granting
a
multiplicative
movement
speed
bonus;
it
stacks
multiplicatively
rather
than
additively
with
other
movement
speed
bonuses.
Highlander
does
not
resist
the
slows
of
Whimsy
and
Charm
.
Highlander
will
not
prevent
the
application
of
the
Sejuani's
"Frost"
debuff,
as
it
does
not
slow
prior
to
being
detonated
by
Permafrost
.
As
of
V3.13
,
all
attack
speed
reduction
is
treated
as
a
slow
and
will
also
be
ignored.
Abilities
with
conditional
effects
are
usually
composed
of
multiple
debuffs,
and
ignoring
the
movement
speed
slowing
debuff
will
not
ignore
the
conditional
effects.
To
name
a
few:
Master
Yi
will
still
have
his
attack
damage
reduced
by
Mocking
Shout
and
Chomp
.
Master
Yi
will
still
be
stunned
by
Petrifying
Gaze
.
