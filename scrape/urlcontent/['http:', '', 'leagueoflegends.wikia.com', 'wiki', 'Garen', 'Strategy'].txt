Garen
Champion
Background
Strategy
Skins
&
Trivia
Skill
usage
Garen's
health
regeneration
is
greatly
increased
due
to
his
passive,
Perseverance
.
This
only
activates
if
he
can
avoid
receiving
champion
or
monster
damage
for
9
seconds,
granting
him
exceptional
sustainability
in
lane,
and
minions
don't
stop
his
regen.
Garen's
Decisive
Strike
makes
him
a
powerful
chaser,
easily
closing
the
gap
and
silencing
enemies
before
they
can
cast
a
slow
or
any
debuff.
It
can
also
be
used
to
make
a
swift
escape
since
it
removes
slows.
What's
more
this
makes
Garen
very
strong
against
most
caster-type
champions
due
to
its
silence;
a
lot
of
combos
can
be
broken
to
save
teammates
and
prevent
casters
(be
AP
or
AD)
from
unleashing
full
damage
with
an
ability
combo,
especially
since
Garen
himself
is
naturally
tanky
enough
to
rush
in
with
little
casualties,
be
it
1
v
1
or
in
a
large
teamfight
while
aiming
for
certain
targets.
Decisive
Strike
can
be
used
effectively
to
push
lanes,
as
this
ability
also
affects
structures
(
turrets
and
inhibitors
).
Using
Decisive
Strike
to
catch
up
with,
silence,
and
deal
damage
to
a
fleeing
champion
is
the
perfect
precursor
to
a
killing
blow
with
Demacian
Justice
.
Decisive
Strike
can
be
used
to
return
to/move
between
lanes
more
swiftly,
as
it
has
no
mana
costs
and
a
fairly
low
cooldown.
Garen
can
be
lethal
in
early
game
fights,
especially
after
getting
his
ultimate.
Judgment
deals
good
continuous
damage
to
enemies.
Decisive
Strike's
speed
boost
is
good
for
chasing
enemies.
Demacian
Justice
also
does
extra
damage
based
on
how
much
health
the
enemy
has
missing
Garen's
best
starting
skill
is
Decisive
Strike
,
as
it
can
be
used
to
last-hit,
silence,
speed
himself
up,
remove
slows,
reset
autoattacks
and
has
very
high
burst
damage
at
early
levels.
Courage
and
Decisive
Strike
mix
well
for
a
powerful
chasing
and
escape
combo.
The
speed
boost
from
Decisive
Strike
letting
you
get
into,
or
out
of
range,
while
the
damage
reduction
of
Courage
allows
you
to
take
reduced
damage
from
nearby
minions
and
enemies
when
chasing
or
escaping.
Because
of
strong
early
game
damage
from
Judgment
,
Garen
lanes
well
with
a
partner
with
an
early
game
stun
such
as
Sion's
Cryptic
Gaze
or
Taric's
Dazzle
.
Unlike
other
abilities,
Judgment
remains
active
when
Garen
is
stunned
because
it
is
not
a
channeled
spell.
With
some
points
into
Judgment
,
Garen
can
easily
farm
and
push
minions
with
it.
Judgment
is
Garen's
main
source
of
damage,
but
has
a
significant
cooldown
and
long
duration
to
maximize
its
damage.
Make
sure
you
activate
Judgment
properly
or
you
will
be
left
being
fairly
ineffectual
in
combat
while
it
cools
down.
Beware
that
Demacian
Justice
can
be
blocked
by
Banshee's
Veil
and
its
damage
depends
on
the
enemy
champion's
magic
resistance
and
health.
Demacian
Justice
can
be
activated
during
Judgment
on
an
enemy
at
low
health.
This
will
cause
Garen
to
immediately
end
his
spin
and
cast
if
the
target
is
in
range.
Build
usage
Garen
is
a
melee
champion,
who
excels
in
killing
enemies
and
being
able
to
take
lots
of
punishment.
Damage
The
Brutalizer
is
a
good
early
item
for
him.
It
can
later
be
built
into
The
Black
Cleaver
,
which
is
very
effective
on
Garen
as
Judgment
will
be
able
to
fully
stack
the
armor
reduction
passive.
Another
option
would
be
Youmuu's
Ghostblade
;
it
gives
similar
AD
and
Armor
penetration,
but
it
also
gives
critical
chance
and
a
short
boost
to
movement
and
attack
speed
.
This
makes
it
a
great
late
game
item
when
critical
chance
outscales
raw
AD
and
Garen
can
use
the
extra
attack
speed
to
help
destroy
turrets.
They
can
also
be
built
together
for
an
easy
source
of
20%
CDR
to
combine
with
Spirit
Visage
.
This
also
increases
wave
minion
clear
due
to
minions
having
low
armor
values.
Last
Whisper
is
a
good
counter
to
teams
stacking
mass
amounts
of
armor.
As
both
Decisive
Strike
and
Judgment
benefits
from
critical
strike
,
items
such
as
Infinity
Edge
increases
the
ability's
damage
output
as
well
as
his
basic
attacks.
Atma's
Impaler
is
a
good
item
to
top
off
Garen's
build,
as
it
gives
more
AD
and
crit
chance
along
with
armor.
Maw
of
Malmortius
is
a
good
anti-mage
item.
An
early
Hexdrinker
can
help
Garen
against
magic
damage
.
Resistances
Courage
scales
with
Garen's
armor
and
magic
resistance
;
therefore,
purchasing
items
with
said
stats
makes
the
ability
more
effective.
Spirit
Visage
synergizes
well
with
Perseverance
,
easily
allowing
him
to
regenerate
0.48%
of
his
health
each
second.
Frozen
Mallet
is
an
excellent
health
item
for
Garen
,
as
it
provides
some
attack
damage
and
a
powerful
slow
to
help
Garen
stick
to
his
target.
It
also
synergizes
well
with
Atma's
Impaler
.
Warmog's
Armor
is
great
on
Garen
as
well.
The
item's
passive
along
with
Perseverance
allows
him
to
regenerate
0.6%
of
his
health
per
second,
allowing
him
to
recover
health
quickly
after
teamfights
without
going
back
to
base.
The
extra
health
along
with
Courage
makes
him
very
hard
to
kill
in
a
teamfight.
In
combination
with
Judgment
,
an
early
Sunfire
Cape
helps
with
Garen's
wave
clearing
capabilities,
as
well
as
providing
mixed
damage.
Randuin's
Omen
helps
reduce
being
kited
by
enemy
champions
and
reduces
the
enemy
ranged
carry's
DPS.
An
early
Warden's
Mail
is
good
against
autoattack-reliant
champions
such
as
Kayle
,
Xin
Zhao
,
Fiora
,
et
cetera.

Countering
Garen
damage
output
is
very
high
early
game;
avoid
early
confrontations
and
play
passively
if
needed.
Harass
Garen
in
lane
every
few
seconds,
if
possible,
to
minimize
the
effect
of
Perseverance
.
Ranged
champions
can
easily
stop
Perseverance
with
an
autoattack
(unless
Garen
goes
farther
back,
which
has
him
give
up
last-hits)
and
farm
in
lane
while
a
safe
distance
from
him
-
they
generally
also
have
abilities
to
let
them
keep
away
from
Garen
even
if
he
charges
at
them.
Ranged
carries
in
particular
will
scale
far
stronger
than
Garen
in
this
situation,
avoiding
his
early-game
advantages
while
securing
their
own
late-game
advantages.
Avoid
going
into
a
brush
that
does
not
have
a
ward
in
it
if
Garen's
current
whereabouts
are
unknown.
Garen
players
have
a
tendency
to
hide
in
bushes,
due
to
the
synergy
between
his
silence
from
Decisive
Strike
and
damage
from
Judgment
.
Garen
is
a
cooldown
based
champion.
However,
all
of
his
ability
cooldowns
are
very
high.
Try
to
attack
him
when
they
are
on
cooldown.
Decisive
Strike
is
very
good
at
stopping
combos
due
to
its
silence;
if
you
happen
to
be
playing
a
caster-type
champion
who
relies
a
lot
on
their
abilities
to
output
most
of
their
damage,
then
Garen
depending
on
how
tanky
he
is
should
have
no
problem
charging
in
to
take
punishment
and
to
silence
you,
disabling
usage
of
your
abilities
and
even
halting
you
in
between
your
combos.
This
can
be
very
dangerous
or
annoying
depending
on
the
situation;
as
Garen
can
save
a
teammate
from
your
burst
or
even
save
himself,
as
well
as
leaving
you
helpless
without
any
possible
defensive
abilities
as
you
take
damage
while
fleeing.
Be
very
cautious
when
low
on
health
and
Garen's
Demacian
Justice
is
off
cooldown.
It
is
often
worth
the
investment
to
purchase
armor
to
counter
Garen's
high
physical
damage.
Think
carefully
before
using
your
Crowd
Control
abilities
on
Garen.
His
Decisive
Strike
will
removes
Slows,
and
Courage
will
reduce
the
duration
of
such
abilities
by
30%
while
Active.
Additionally,
hard
CC
will
not
stop
the
channel
on
Judgment
only
his
movement.
Keep
away
from
him,
especially
if
playing
softer
champions,
as
it
deals
very
high
damage
over
a
short
duration.
Like
most
melee
champions,
Garen
is
quite
vulnerable
to
ranged
harassment.
But
because
of
his
really
high
damage
and
the
fact
that
most
ranged
champs
are
squishy,
at
lvl
6
he
can
burst
them
down
instantly.
So
if
the
ranged
champ
doesn't
get
a
good
advantage
over
him,
he
will
melt
anyway.
Buying
a
Hexdrinker
may
help
as
it
may
block
most
(if
not
all)
of
the
damage
from
Garen's
Demacian
Justice
.
Do
not
forget
that
his
main
form
of
damage
is
still
physical,
however.
Because
Garen
usually
builds
a
lot
of
health,
getting
champions
or
items
that
deal
%
health
damage
can
cause
him
to
melt
quickly,
such
as
Blade
of
the
Ruined
King's
active
and
passive,
Amumu's
Despair
,
Kog'Maw's
Bio-Arcane
Barrage
,
Vayne's
Silver
Bolts
and
Zed's
Contempt
for
the
Weak
.
High
lifesteal
is
also
an
effective
counter.
Teemo
is
considered
to
be
the
best
known
counter
to
Garen
.
Teemo
can
effectively
poke
Garen
and
escape
from
him,
if
played
correctly.
Teemo's
Blinding
Dart
can
be
used
to
additionally,
deal
damage
to
Garen,
or
either
prevent
him
from
hitting
Decisive
Strike
on
you,
but
be
warned,
the
silence
will
still
affect
you.
Toxic
Shot
allows
you
to
harass
Garen
and
prevents
him
from
gaining
extra
health
from
his
Perseverance
.
Noxious
Trap
allows
you
to
slow
Garen,
and
prevent
any
hope
of
him
getting
near
you.
Use
it
while
you
are
escaping
from
him,
then
retaliate
when
he
attempts
to
escape.
Be
warned,
you
should
never
be
caught
by
Garen.
His
combo
is
strong
enough
to
kill
you
at
early
levels.
