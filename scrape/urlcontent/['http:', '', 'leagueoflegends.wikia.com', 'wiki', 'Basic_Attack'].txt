For
the
item,
see
Archangel's
Staff
.
An
auto
attack
(also
called
standard
,
normal
,
or
basic
attack
)
is
the
attack
performed
by
a
champion
when
right-clicking
an
enemy
unit.
Auto
attacks
are
also
performed
by
an
idle
champion
when
an
enemy
unit
ventures
too
close
to
it,
or
when
the
"attack
move"
function
is
used
(default
Shift
+
right-click
).
Auto
attacks
are
also
performed
by
monsters
,
minions
and
turrets
.
Auto
attacking
can
be
disabled
from
in-game
interface
in
order
that
a
champion
won't
start
attacking
without
being
ordered
to.

Behavior
Champion
When
using
attack-move,
the
champion
stops
to
attack
any
hostile
that
gets
in
their
way
en-route
to
a
destination.
If
a
champion
has
an
attack
target,
they
will
continue
to
attack
it
if
in
range
and
will
move
closer
to
it
when
out
of
range,
until
either
a
new
target
is
specified,
a
cancel
order
is
issued
(pressing
the
S
key
or
by
specifying
another
move
order),
or
they
lose
vision
of
the
target.
Minions
Minions
will
automatically
attack
their
closest
target
by
default,
but
may
change
targets
in
a
similar
manner
to
turrets.
For
more
information
see
the
behavior
of
minions
page
.
Turrets
The
behavior
of
turrets
is
described
on
the
corresponding
page
as
well
as
the
damage
of
turrets
auto
attacks.
Turret
auto
attacks
differ
from
regular
auto
attacks
by
increasing
damage.
(Every
consecutive
turret
auto
attack
deals
slightly
more
damage
than
the
last)
Vision
Auto
attacking
while
hiding
in
brush
or
fog
of
war
will
reveal
the
attacking
unit,
and
if
in
brush
auto
attacking
will
reveal
allies
nearby
while
auto
attacking.
Damage
Auto
attacks
always
deal
physical
damage
unless
one
of
the
following
abilities
is
used,
in
which
case
the
whole
damage
of
the
auto
attack
will
be
magic
damage.
Mordekaiser's
Mace
of
Spades
Poppy's
Devastating
Blow
Twisted
Fate's
Pick
a
Card
However,
certain
items
,
abilities
or
passives
may
cause
them
to
deal
additional
magic
damage
on
top
of
their
base
physical
damage.
Damage
from
auto
attacks
benefits
from
the
attack
damage
stat
on
the
attacker
and
are
reduced
by
armor
on
the
target.
When
auto
attacking
a
turret
,
the
damage
is
based
on
the
base
attack
damage
added
to
either
the
bonus
attack
damage
or
40%
of
a
champion's
ability
power
,
depending
on
which
one
is
higher.
Even
though
it
may
use
an
ability
power
scaling
on
the
auto
attack,
it
still
is
entirely
physical
damage.
Attack
Speed
The
rate
at
which
a
champion
attacks
is
called
attack
speed
and
is
capped
at
2.
5
;
this
means
that
a
champion
can
attack
at
most,
5
times
in
a
2
second
period.
Some
abilities
refresh
the
attack
timer
and
allow
a
champion
to
attack
again
immediately
if
they
use
the
ability
after
their
auto
attack.
