Strategy
Will
of
the
Ancients
is
very
useful
with
ability
power
-based
champions
that
have
spells
requiring
health
costs
(e.g.
Mordekaiser
)
as
the
spell
vamp
helps
mitigate
these
costs.
Cooldown-
or
energy-based
champions,
such
as
Katarina
and
Kennen
,
can
also
make
use
of
Will
of
the
Ancients
for
the
sustainability
as
they
can
spam
their
skills
more
willingly
than
mana-based
champions.
