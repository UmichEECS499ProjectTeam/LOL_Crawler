Kalamanda
Becomes
Adventuring
Boomtown
Village
courted
by
world
leaders
for
access
to
resources
Bob
Nashahago
reporting
from
Kalamanda
As
reports
of
mineral
strikes
make
their
way
through
Valoran,
the
population
of
Kalamanda
swells
A
month
has
passed
since
the
village
of
Kalamanda
announced
its
findings
of
tremendous
mineral
and
magical
wealth
to
the
world,
and
the
effects
of
that
announcement
have
transformed
this
once
quiet
village
into
a
bustling
hub
of
adventure
and
commerce.
Adventurers
from
all
across
Valoran
have
descended
on
the
village,
hoping
to
claim
their
share
of
untold
riches.
Likewise,
the
city-states
of
Valoran
have
sent
delegations
to
Kalamanda
to
meet
with
Mayor
Anson
Ridley
in
the
hopes
of
securing
lucrative
mining
contracts.
Even
the
League
has
made
its
presence
known
in
the
village,
as
it
will
soon
begin
research
on
the
two
nexuses
discovered
alongside
the
vast
resource
deposits.
The
temporary
housing
that
Kalamanda
had
set
up
just
after
the
announcement
last
month
is
already
filled
to
capacity.
Workers
are
in
the
process
of
constructing
more
camps
for
the
influx
of
people
that
are
still
making
their
way
to
the
village.
The
increase
in
Kalamanda’s
population
has
only
brought
with
it
a
slight
increase
in
crime
and
other
public
disturbances.
Mercantilism
in
Kalamanda
is
on
a
huge
upswing,
as
adventuring
and
prospecting
equipment
are
in
high
demand.
Despite
all
the
chaos,
spirits
amongst
the
work
force
are
quite
positive.
Contributing
to
this
is
word
that
two
smaller-scale
resource
strikes
of
enchantable
gold
have
already
been
uncovered,
strikes
surpassing
the
dreams
of
two
lucky
prospectors
–
even
after
Kalamanda’s
cut
had
been
accounted
for.
Two
separate
stabilizing
factors
on
Kalamanda
are
the
arrivals
of
the
city-state
delegations
that
are
meeting
with
Mayor
Ridley
and
the
League
of
Legends’
nexus
research
team.
Of
the
city-states
present,
Demacia
and
Noxus
have
the
largest
entourages
in
Kalamanda;
Piltover,
Zaun,
and
Ionia
also
have
representation
present
in
the
village,
albeit
smaller
in
scale.
No
city-state
has
secured
a
contract
yet,
but
an
agreement
with
any
of
the
city-states
here
may
be
reached
as
early
as
next
week.
Tensions
between
the
Demacia
and
Noxus
camps
remain
high
in
the
light
of
recent
allegations
by
elements
in
Demacia
that
Noxus
was
responsible
for
the
pirating
of
the
DSS
Excursion
last
month.
Nevertheless,
there
have
been
no
reported
clashes
between
the
two
city-states
in
Kalamanda.
The
League’s
recent
arrival
to
Kalamanda
heralds
the
beginning
of
research
into
the
two
magic
nexuses
discovered
with
the
valuable
mineral
deposits.
Both
League
and
Kalamanda
scholars
are
scheduled
to
begin
examining
the
large
nexuses
in
three
days.
Leading
the
endeavor
is
none
other
than
Master
Summoner
Randall
Portero,
Lead
Field
of
Justice
Surveyor
for
the
League.
"We
are
very
interested
in
these
[nexuses],
as
they
could
very
well
represent
a
marked
upswing
in
the
amount
of
magic
that
Runeterra
is
naturally
regenerating."
Portero
continued,
"This
could
be
more
proof
that
the
whole
concept
of
the
battle
arena
is
truly
benefitting
us
all!"
When
asked,
Ridley
was
somewhat
vague
about
detailing
the
progress
in
negotiations
between
Kalamanda
and
the
city-state
delegations.
"We
are
making
ardent
strides
with
visitors
from
the
great
city-states
of
Valoran
in
coming
to
terms
with
excavation
rights.
We
are
moving
cautiously,
but
we
are
moving
ever
forward."
Ridley
did
shed
some
light
on
one
lingering
question
of
these
negotiations:
the
idea
of
extraction
exclusivity.
"While
we
are
entertaining
the
notion
of
exclusivity
for
a
city-state,
we
would
only
do
so
if
the
terms
benefitted
Kalamanda
in
a
way
that
mutual
extraction
never
would.
We
won’t
make
such
a
decision
lightly
or
hastily."
Barbarian
Conclave
Arrives
in
Freljord
Tryndamere
honors
the
former
Ice
Dervish’s
passing
Quinton
Groat
reporting
from
Rakelstake,
Freljord
The
modest
population
of
Freljord
was
in
shock
this
week,
as
hundreds
of
barbarians
-
including
Tryndamere,
the
Barbarian
King
-
arrived
to
pay
respects
to
the
late
Princess
Mauvole
of
the
Ice
Dervish
tribe.
Princess
Lissandra,
her
successor,
appeared
unsurprised
by
the
event,
fueling
rumors
that
this
may
have
been
part
of
the
discussions
in
her
recent
summit
with
Princess
Ashe,
the
Frost
Archer
and
Tryndamere's
fellow
League
champion.
Ashe
was
present
for
the
barbarian
procession,
and
she
met
afterward
with
Tryndamere
and
Lissandra
for
a
private
dinner.
The
visiting
barbarians
have
conducted
themselves
with
uncharacteristic
civility
within
Rakelstake,
offering
assistance
to
local
businesses
and
sharing
the
spoils
of
their
daily
hunts.
Less
than
one
month
ago,
Lissandra
swore
fealty
to
Ashe,
inciting
malice
from
the
third
tribe
leader
Princess
Sejuani,
the
Winter's
Claw
.
Sejuani
retreated
to
isolation
shortly
after
the
announcement,
causing
speculation
that
she
would
respond
to
the
alliance
with
violence,
but
there
have
been
no
reports
of
activity
from
the
Winter's
Claw
tribe
in
the
last
month.
The
arrival
of
the
barbarians,
some
predict,
is
a
reactionary
show
of
force
by
the
newly
united
tribes.
Sejuani
could
not
be
reached
for
questioning,
and
no
comment
was
offered
by
any
tribesman
of
the
Winter's
Claw.
Tryndamere's
appearance
in
Freljord
comes
at
a
strange
time,
as
the
barbarians
have
recently
militarized
in
response
to
escalating
Noxian
aggressions,
a
product
of
their
Northern
Barbarian-Pacification
campaign.
Tryndamere
has
historically
spearheaded
the
resistance
against
Noxian
incursion,
and
his
absence
at
such
a
critical
time
has
raised
some
eyebrows.
When
questioned,
Tryndamere
laughed,
"Worry
about
barbarians?
Save
your
worry
for
Noxus."
His
confidence
seems
not
to
be
misplaced,
as
an
anonymous
Noxian
source
informs
us
that
Pacification
efforts
have
been
stymied
by
unyielding
barbarian
patrols.
The
arrival
of
League
Emissary
Gravil
Torenk
in
Rakelstake
yesterday
further
added
to
the
commotion.
According
to
local
authorities,
he
was
summoned
to
the
Dervish
Crystal
Hall
for
an
audience
with
Lissandra
and
her
League
guests.
No
announcements
have
been
made
following
the
meeting,
but
the
air
is
charged
with
anticipation
as
citizens
of
Rakelstake
await
some
explanation
as
to
why
the
small
city
has
received
this
bizarre
influx
of
visitors.
For
our
part,
we
were
provided
only
with
this
statement
from
the
Barbarian
King,
as
he
left
the
Crystal
Hall
en
route
to
a
nearby
barbarian
camp,
"I
don’t
know
why
people
are
so
curious.
Freljord
is
a
lovely
place;
the
air
has
the
kind
of
sting
we
barbarians
can
appreciate.
Besides,
would
you
decline
an
invitation
from
the
Frost
Archer?"

Ram
Steed
,
your
eye
inside
the
League
of
Legends
Greetings,
loyal
readers!
It's
been
another
exciting
month
behind
the
scenes
of
the
League
of
Legends.
As
usual,
yours
truly
has
been
digging
to
get
all
the
latest
dirt
on
your
favorite
champions.
Let's
see
who’s
made
the
list
today!
Blitzcrank
Last
week,
Blitzcrank
proved
once
and
for
all
that
he
doesn't
have
an
iron
heart
when
he
spanked
Singed
in
a
behind
the
scenes
smack-down.
After
a
battle
in
the
Twisted
Treeline
last
Thursday,
the
crazy
chemist
took
to
his
usual
habit
of
spitting
jabs
at
Blitzcrank.
Singed
was
heard
to
say:
"...so
I
know
you
don't
have
the
stones.
Even
if
you
did,
what
would
they
be
–
two
ball
bearings
and
a
tin
can?"
Those
close
to
Singed
commented
that
the
insult
was
no
more
than
one
of
Singed's
usual
jabs.
This
time,
however,
the
Great
Steam
Golem
unleashed
a
jab
of
his
own,
firing
his
rocket
fist
into
his
counterpart's
more
tender
parts.
Singed
was
brought
to
his
knees
in
front
of
many
other
champions,
as
Blitzcrank
walked
quietly
away.
Sources
close
to
the
Great
Steam
Golem
say
that
this
was
a
long
time
coming.
A
source
confided:
"Blitzcrank
is
a
good
guy.
He's
always
on
his
best
behavior,
but
he's
kind
of
an
introvert
in
his
private
life.
There
have
been
some
people,
like
Singed,
who
take
his
quiet
kindness
for
weakness.
That's
a
mistake."
A
mistake
that
Singed
learned
the
hard
way.
Neither
Blitzcrank
nor
Singed
could
be
reached
for
comment.
Too
bad
for
them!
All
we
know
is,
Blitzcrank
better
be
watching
his
back!
The
Cougar
is
on
the
Prowl
There's
always
some
sort
of
romance
in
the
air
in
the
League
of
Legends
–
some
of
it
more
exciting
than
others.
The
last
month
has
been
no
different,
but
with
an
unusual
twist!
The
Bestial
Huntress
has
long
been
an
object
of
affection
for
the
male
fans
of
the
League
(and
especially
ones
less
mature
than
her,
hubba
hubba!).
Let's
face
it
–
how
can
she
lose
with
that
jungle-toned
body,
animal
passion,
and
a
fur
bikini?
Nevertheless,
Nidalee's
recent
tastes
in
companions
have
been,
in
this
writer's
opinion,
questionable
as
she
has
been
linked
to
–
wait
for
it
–
Journal
of
Justice
reporter
Bob
Nashahago.
Yes,
that's
right.
The
hack
Journal
of
Justice
writer
best
known
for
his
tag-line,
"I'm
Bob
Nashahago
and
you're
not,"
was
spotted
at
a
romantic
picnic
getaway
in
Demacia's
famous
Majestic
Park
last
weekend,
feeding
everybody's
favorite
cougar
a
creamy
chocolate
mousse.
Sources
close
to
Nidalee
have
this
to
say:
"Bob's
actually
a
really
nice
guy.
Sure,
he’s
a
little
loud
and
boisterous,
but
you
have
to
look
past
the
surface."
Personally,
this
writer
doesn't
have
to
look
past
the
surface
to
see
when
a
bad
idea
is
a
bad
idea.
Until
Next
Time...
As
always,
yours
truly
will
keep
an
eye
on
the
inside
to
bring
you
the
juiciest
in
champion
news.
This
is
Ram
Steed,
reporting
from
the
streets
of
Valoran.
Reclaiming
the
Lost
Revered
Professor
Stanwick
Pididly
aids
Noxus
in
reviving
a
fallen
hero
Richor
Ebony
reporting
from
Zaun
While
it
is
true
that
we
Noxians
take
great
pride
in
our
magical
prowess,
let
it
never
be
said
that
we
are
a
covetous
or
closed-minded
lot.
Recently,
the
Zaunite
chemist,
inventor,
and
visionary
known
as
Professor
Stanwick
Pididly
sought
to
witness
one
of
our
most
closely
guarded
rituals.
Of
some
infamy
in
foreign
lands,
the
Rite
of
Reclamation
is
not
something
often
shared
with
outsiders.
On
this
particular
occasion,
however,
our
well-spoken
guest's
renown
was
quite
convincing,
and
the
headmaster
of
the
Bleak
Academy
saw
fit
to
grant
his
request.
As
it
happens,
this
proved
to
be
a
most
wise
decision.
I
make
this
claim
because
the
eve
of
his
visitation
marked
a
peculiar
event
in
Noxian
history,
and
remains
one
of
very
few
instances
in
which
the
Rite
of
Reclamation
actually
failed.
Our
dear
departed
Urgot
,
who
once
fought
so
bravely
against
the
insolent
foes
of
Noxus
(and
later
served
as
a
field
executioner),
simply
would
not
rise.
While
the
definitive
reason
Urgot
was
unable
to
hear
the
necromancers'
call
shall
forever
remain
a
mystery,
it
has
been
theorized
that
his
mortal
remains
were
simply
in
too
great
a
state
of
disrepair.
The
whole
episode
would
have
been
quite
an
embarrassing
affair,
had
Pididly
not
proven
intrigued
rather
than
frustrated
by
the
problem.
After
a
pensive
moment,
the
Professor
proposed
an
alternative
solution
to
the
quandary.
And
so,
at
his
behest,
the
remains
of
Urgot
were
entrusted
to
his
custody
along
with
a
retainer
of
some
of
the
Academy's
expert
necromancers.
For
months
Pididly
and
his
protégés
slaved
away
in
his
laboratories,
attempting
to
repair
the
body
of
our
fallen
hero
in
any
manner
possible.
Time
and
time
again
they
performed
their
rituals,
each
attempt
bringing
them
one
step
closer
to
unraveling
the
riddle.
Finally,
after
a
series
of
disastrous
experiments,
a
techmaturgical
machine
of
Pididly's
design
was
constructed.
At
its
core
lay
a
conduit
specifically
designed
to
harness
the
necromantic
energies
of
the
Noxian
occultists.
This
time,
the
ritual
did
not
fail.
This
time
Urgot
heard
the
call.
Due
to
the
intervention
of
the
revered
Professor,
our
loyal
departed
son
has
been
restored;
a
service
that
the
High
Command
will
not
soon
forget.
The
Rite
of
Reclamation
is
beyond
sacred,
and
the
implications
of
its
failure
are
demoralizing
at
best.
The
ingenuity
of
our
Zaunite
caller,
however,
has
renewed
our
faith
in
the
will
of
a
Noxian
to
conquer
adversity,
even
in
death.
The
spirit
of
a
Noxian
soldier
cannot
be
undone,
even
through
the
near
complete
destruction
of
his
mortal
coil.
Urgot
has
been
returned
to
us,
to
fight
in
representation
of
both
his
fatherland
of
Noxus
and
surrogate
fatherland
of
Zaun.
Woe
betide
those
who
should
run
afoul
of
Urgot
on
the
battlefield.
Woe
betide
those
who
should
rouse
the
ire
of
the
Noxian
High
Command.
Forever
strong!

We

"The
note
about
Kalamanda
was
shocking;
I
hope
the
League
can
make
use
of
those
nexuses
to
be
able
to
have
another
Field
of
Justice
soon.
I
don't
know
why,
[but]
I
think
it
won’t
go
as
smoothly
as
I
would
want
it.
The
resources

Your

Lehran.
If

learned
anything
from
the
five
Rune
Wars
that
Runeterra
has
suffered
through,
then
it
is
that
an
individual’s
lust
for
wealth
and
power
can
bring
a
civilization
to
its
knees.
As
for
a
potential
Field
of
Justice...
if
I
had
to
fathom
a
guess,
I
would
think
that
is
something
relatively
high
on
the
priority
list
for
the
League’s
research
team.
That
is,
provided
the
nexuses
are
suitable
for
use
in
a
battle
arena.
Kalamanda
is
a
place
we
should
all
be
keeping
an
eye
on.
"You
allow
to
Bob
Nashahago
to
go
on
and
on
claiming
that
the
DSS
Excursion
was
[a
victim
of]
piracy
when
there
is
weak
evidence
at
best
to
support
these
claims.
He
just
follows
on
the
reports
on
the
Demacian
Agenda
and
has
not
shown
any
investigative
journalism
of
his
own.
Clearly
Mr.
Nashahago
is
just
one
of
Demacia's
pawns
that
they
use
to
control
the
media."

Rest
assured,
PapaBear,
that
our
reporters
are
as
objective
as
possible.
Personal
prejudices
have
no
room
in
this
publication,
and
journalistic
chicanery
in
any
form
will
not
be
tolerated.
As
far
as
Summoner
Nashahago
is
concerned,
I
feel
his
reporting
on
the
unfortunate
demise
of
the
DSS
Excursion
was
fair
and
balanced.
I’ve
known
him
for
many
years,
and
he
is
loyal
to
the
League
first
and
always.
Note
that
when
each
article
is
published,
we
indicate
whether
the
author
is
either
reporting
or
commenting.
We
will
strive
to
keep
objectivity
to
the
forefront
of
our
reporting;
you
have
every
right
to
call
us
out
should
we
stray
from
this.
"As
for
this
business
of
Necromancy
on
the
high
seas,
surely
you
must
be
jesting.
A
powerful
navy
like
Demacia's
must
be
awfully
ashamed
of
losing
cargo
to
pirates,
making
up
stories
that
Necromancy
was
involved
in
the
act.
I
believe
Champion
Kayle
and
the
League
are
wasting
their
time
in
this
investigation."
--
Kingvolke
I
have
every
confidence
that
the
facts
involving
this
event
will
come
to
light,
Kingvolke
–
especially
with
Kayle
and
league
investigators
devoting
their
time
and
energy
to
the
matter.
Despite
Demacia’s
obvious
embarrassment,
they
were
right
to
call
upon
the
League
for
assistance.
Perhaps
there
is
more
to
this
story
than
just
the
blatant
use
of
necromancy
by
unknown
pirates.
Call
it
a
hunch,
but
my
hunches
have
helped
me
stay
on
top
of
the
journalism
game
for
more
years
than
I
care
to
remember.
