Skill
usage
Be
careful
when
using
Ambush
near
enemy
turrets
,
as
turrets
can
see
invisible
units.
It
is
always
good
to
use
Ambush
to
scout
brushes
and
to
look
for
enemies.
Twitch
can
be
very
good
at
chipping
away
an
opponent's
health
with
the
true
damage
from
his
passive.
After
hitting
an
opponent
a
few
times,
throw
your
poison
vial
(W)
to
hit
enemies
at
long
range
and
add
two
poison
ticks,
but
more
importantly
to
extend
the
amount
of
time
they
are
taking
damage
from
your
poison.
Twitch's
Ambush
has
a
timer.
Watching
the
timer
is
very
important
when
using
stealth.
Twitch
is
very
good
at
scouting
ahead
of
his
allies
while
stealthed.
Expunge
has
a
large
range
,
apply
as
many
stacks
of
Deadly
Venom
as
possible
before
using
it.
PENDING
FOR
TEST
Spray
And
Pray
only
provides
33%
of
the
usual
life
steal
when
attacking
more
than
one
target.
When
the
first
hit
with
Spray
And
Pray
is
a
critical
strike
,
all
the
units
hit
with
that
shot
will
suffer
critical
strike
damage.
Play
cautiously
around
characters
with
crowd
control.
Twitch's
low
health
makes
him
especially
vulnerable
to
bursts
of
damage.
Be
careful
of
enemy
champions
who
have
a
Vision
Ward
or
the
Oracle's
Lens
as
well
as
champions
who
have
abilities
that
can
detect
stealth,
such
as
Morgana's
Soul
Shackles
.
This
makes
Twitch
unable
to
scout
safely
or
move
close
enough
for
a
kill.
Spray
And
Pray
is
a
very
good
ability
to
use
during
teamfights,
because
you
can
hit
all
5
members
of
the
opposing
team.
At
high
levels
and
assuming
that
you
are
a
skilled
Twitch
player
and
a
skilled
jungler,
you
can
move
Twitch
into
the
jungle.
He
is
weak
when
it
comes
to
farming
in
the
jungle
for
long
periods
of
time,
however,
his
ganks
with
red
buff
go
unparalleled.
Twitch
can
function
as
a
attack
damage
carry
in
bot
lane
as
well,
and
is
best
supported
by
a
character
that
can
hold
the
lane
1v2
while
he
ganks.
When
ganking,
Ambush
should
be
used
early,
so
as
not
to
be
caught
by
regular
wards
on
your
way
over.
When
you
arrive
at
your
destination,
if
your
stealth
timer
is
low,
sit
in
a
bush
and
wait
to
re-stealth
prior
to
jumping
on
your
opponent.
At
the
start
of
the
match,
try
waiting
until
the
enemy
jungler
finishes
killing
blue,
then
kill
him.
If
successful,
this
provides
a
substantial
early
game
lead
and
can
shut
down
junglers
that
scale
into
late
game(
Amumu
,
Olaf
,
etc.).
If
you
take
Ambush
first,
use
it
sparingly
so
that
you
don't
run
out
of
mana
early
game.
Taking
Ambush
early
game
allows
Twitch
to
check
bushes
without
taking
too
much
damage
and
allows
him
to
counter
jungle
more
efficiently.
If
you
take
Expunge
first,
use
the
damage
to
farm
effectively.
Do
not
use
it
to
harass
unless
you
have
six
stacks
of
Deadly
Venom
otherwise
you
will
run
out
of
mana
trying
to
harass
and
farm
at
the
same
time.
Spray
and
Pray
will
not
damage
an
enemy
nexus.
Build
usage
Twitch's
attack
speed
is
among
the
highest
in
the
game,
allowing
you
to
focus
on
other
offensive
stats.
Infinity
Edge
is
a
highly
recommended
item
to
obtain
first,
granting
the
damage
and
critical
strike-related
stats
Twitch
lacks.
Try
purchasing
items
that
provide
a
variety
of
stats
for
defense/offense,
such
as
Wit's
End
for
magic
resistance
and
The
Black
Cleaver
for
armor
penetration.
Using
life
steal
also
helps
with
Twitch's
small
health
pool,
although
when
using
your
ultimate,
you
will
only
receive
a
third
of
the
usual
life
steal
per
target.
Runaan's
Hurricane
lets
Twitch
proc
Deadly
Venom
stacks
on
multiple
enemies.
Statikk
Shiv
procs
on
every
target
hit
by
Spray
and
Pray
.
Use
this
followed
by
Expunge
to
deal
massive
multi-target
damage.
When
Sword
of
the
Divine
is
used
in
conjunction
with
his
ult
he
can
nuke
down
the
entire
team
as
every
target
hit
by
his
ultimate
gets
the
critical.
Infinity
Edge
Furthers
this
by
making
the
3
guaranteed
criticals
provided
by
Sword
of
the
divine
even
stronger.

Countering
Work
with
your
team
to
focus
on
Twitch
when
he
comes
out
of
the
stealth
as
he
is
extremely
squishy.
The
easy
way
to
counter
Twitch
is
to
purchase
a
Oracle's
Lens
to
detect
him
when
he
is
stealthed
or
placing
a
Vision
Ward
in
a
path
where
you
think
Twitch
usually
stays.
For
Twisted
Treeline,
purchasing
a
Hextech
Sweeper
is
recommended
to
prevent
Twitch
from
escaping
from
a
deadly
situation.
Keep
your
allies
spread
if
Twitch
is
using
his
Spray
and
Pray
.
Keep
in
mind
that
it
also
procs
on
hit-effect
such
as
life
steal
and
critical
strikes,
allowing
Twitch
to
wipe
out
your
team
single-handedly.
Very
few
ADC's
can
match
Twitch
's
power
with
a
full
build,
if
you
want
to
duel
him
you
must
be
way
more
fed
than
him
or
be
a
APC
or
assasin,
else
you
will
not
be
able
to
match
his
damage.
When
Twitch
is
no
longer
seen
in
lane,
let
your
allies
know
by
calling
mia/ss,
lowering
his
high
ganking
potential
with
Ambush
.
Due
to
his
low
health,
hard
CC
such
as
stuns
and
snares
are
devastating
to
him.
Twitch's
late
game
power
is
extremely
high,
as
he
can
burst
down
entire
teams
-
don't
let
him
get
to
that
point!
Twitch
can
easily
backdoor
as
Spray
and
Pray
lets
him
outrange
turrets,
this
however
leaves
him
somewhat
weaker,
as
he
loses
the
powerful
damage
boost
from
Spray
and
Pray
engaging
right
after
he
will
be
easier
to
deal
with.
