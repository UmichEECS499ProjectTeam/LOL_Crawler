Bio
Azubu
Frost
and
the
Season
2
Championship
When
the
team
first
began
as
Azubu
Frost,
they
appeared
in
the
League
of
Legends
scene
during
season
2.
Their
strong
performance
throughout
the
season
got
them
to
Los
Angeles
for
the
Season
Two
Championship
in
October.
In
the
group
stage
they
displayed
there
dominance,
defeating
Invictus
Gaming
,
SK
Gaming
and
CLG
Prime
,
which
brought
the
to
the
top
team
from
their
group
(Group
A).
The
went
on
to
the
quarterfinals
where
Team
solomid
awaited
them.
However
the
European
team
took
the
first
game,
ending
Frost's
winning
streak
when
they
seemed
unbeatable.
Yet
that
small
blunder
didn't
repeat
in
the
following
two
matches,
which
secured
their
place
in
the
Grand
finals.
Now
they
were
up
against
the
Taipei
Assassins
.
Here
Frost's
reign
of
power
fell
with
a
1-3
score,
giving
2nd
place
to
Azubu
Frost
and
the
Championship
Victory
to
Taipei
Assassins
.
Cheating
Controversy
During
the
Championship
a
controversy
developed
over
cheating.
The
stage
for
the
Championship
was
set
outdoors
with
a
large
screens
above
each
computer
assembly
for
each
team.
During
a
paused
moment
in
the
match
with
Team
solomid
attempting
to
fix
audio
problems,
TSM
's
Chaox
had
reported
he
had
witness
Woong
looking
up
at
the
minimap
screens
during
the
game.
Although
TSM's
Dyrus
had
also
looked
up
at
the
screens
during
this
moment.
An
investigation
by
Riot
Games
followed
with
the
conclusion
both
players
were
at
fault.
With
video
evidence
a
warning
was
issued
to
Dyrus
.
However
Woong's
actions
were
determined
to
have
had
a
direct
affect
on
the
match
and
therefore
warranted
the
consequence
of
a
$30,000
fine
for
Azubu
Frost's
behavior.
CJ
Entus
Frost
On
February
4,
2013
the
Blaze
and
Frost
contracts
expire
and
were
not
renewed
with
Azubu.
CJ
Entus
then
officially
procures
both
teams.
In
March
CJ
Entus
Frost
place
2nd
in
the
IEM
Season
VII
-
World
Championship.
Afterword
Woong
leaves
the
team
and
is
replaced
by
Hermes.
