Surrender
vote
in
progress
Surrendering
is
a
vote
allowing
summoners
to
end
the
game
prematurely.
A
player
can
call
a
surrender
vote
by
typing
"/surrender"
or
"/ff"
(forfeit)
in
chat,
or
by
going
to
options
screen,
choosing
"More
options",
and
then
pressing
"Surrender"
button.
Calling
a
surrender
vote
is
equivalent
to
voting
for
one.
Initiating
a
surrender
vote
will
show
a
pop-up
for
60
seconds
from
which
players
will
be
able
to
cast
their
vote
for
or
against
the
motion.
At
least
70%
of
the
team
must
agree
to
surrender
in
order
for
the
vote
to
pass.
This
means
that
on
a
team
of
three
or
fewer
players,
the
entire
team
must
agree.
Any
player
who
abstains
from
the
vote
is
counted
against
the
motion
to
surrender.
At
the
end
of
the
60
seconds,
if
<70%
of
the
team
has
agreed
to
surrender,
the
vote
fails
and
cannot
be
initiated
again
for
three
minutes.
If
>70%
do
agree
to
surrender,
the
game
will
end
in
victory
for
the
opposite
team.
[1]
Players
can
vote
by
clicking
"Yes"
or
"No"
button,
as
well
as
typing
"/surrender"
or
"/ff"
or
"/nosurrender".
Time
limit
Summoners
can
not
call
a
surrender
vote
before
a
certain
time
is
reached.
On
Summoner's
Rift
,
surrenders
cannot
be
called
before
the
20
minute
mark.
On
Twisted
Treeline
,
surrenders
cannot
be
called
before
the
15
minute
mark.
[2]
On
Crystal
Scar
,
surrenders
cannot
be
called
before
the
15
minute
mark.
On
Howling
Abyss
,
surrenders
cannot
be
called
before
the
20
minute
mark.
If
you
attempt
to
surrender
earlier,
a
"It
is
too
early
in
the
game
to
surrender!"
message
will
appear.
On
Summoner's
Rift
,
you
must
wait
3
minutes
after
a
failed
vote
before
your
team
can
call
another
surrender
vote.
Trivia
You
can
surrender
even
if
your
team
has
destroyed
the
enemy
nexus,
before
the
"Victory"
message
appears.
It
will
end
up
with
Defeat
for
the
surrendering
team,
even
though
they
have
already
destroyed
the
enemy
nexus
and
completed
the
game
objective.
Completing
the
surrender
process
while
your
Nexus
is
being
destroyed
will
result
in
the
Nexus
exploding
twice.
If
the
enemy
team
surrenders
and
you
surrender
in
quick
succesion
afterwards
you
will
end
up
surrendering
even
though
the
enemy
team
surrendered
first,
thus
ending
in
a
loss
for
your
team.
