Health
Potion
is
a
consumable
item
in
League
of
Legends
.
[1]
Consuming
a
Health
Potion
will
restore
150
health
over
15
seconds
after
being
used.
It
is
a
very
useful
item
for
nearly
every
champion
early
game
due
to
its
affordability
but
loses
its
effectiveness
as
champions'
levels
increase.
The
maximum
health
will
be
too
substantial
for
it
to
be
significant
and
any
damage
received
would
be
too
great.
It
used
to
be
highly
recommended
to
buy
multiple
Health
Potions
when
jungling
as
it
provided
increased
early-game
survivability.
The
%
health
gain
from
jungling
creeps
reduces
their
utility.

Potion
Notes
You
can
use
multiple
Health
Potions
while
you
have
one
active
which
will
queue
them
up
to
be
used
after
the
previous
completes
(maximum
5
stacks).
Using
a
Health
Potion
,
as
with
all
other
activated
items
(with
the
exception
of
Entropy
),
does
not
interrupt
channelling.
This
is
particularly
useful
if
jungling
as
Fiddlesticks
,
as
it
will
not
interrupt
Drain
.
It
also
won't
interrupt
Recall
or
point-capturing
in
Dominion
.
Health
Potion
and
Mana
Potion
are
currently
two
of
the
cheapest
items
in
League
of
Legends.
Using
a
Health
Potion
can
counter
the
damage
from
damage
over
time
spells
such
as
Mordekaiser's
Children
of
the
Grave
or
Ignite
(keeping
in
mind,
of
course,
the
reduced
effectiveness
from
Ignite's
effect).
Health
Potion
can
not
be
used
at
full
health.
when
used
Health
Potion
gives
an
additional
10
healthregen/second
for
15
seconds,
which
can
be
improved
by
Spirit
Visage
,
resulting
in
12
healthregen/second
or
a
total
amount
of
180
health
restored.
Trivia
During
seasonal
events,
the
Health
Potion
has
been
replaced
by
seasonal
items
with
the
same
effect,
but
different
names/pictures.
The
Eggnog
Health
Potion
was
a
seasonal
item
that
replaced
the
Health
Potion
during
the
2009
Snowdown
Showdown
,
2010
Snowdown
Showdown
,
and
2011
Snowdown
Showdown
celebrations.
The
Candy
Corn
was
a
seasonal
item
that
replaced
the
Health
Potion
during
the
2010
and
2011
Harrowing
events
.
The
Phoenix
Bun
was
another
seasonal
item
that
replaced
the
Health
Potion
during
the
Lunar
Revel
celebration.
