looking

)

wait
in
order
to
use
champion's
ability
,
item
's
activate,
or
summoner

,
masteries
,

of
the

Summoner
spell
cooldown
All
summoner
spells
have
long
cooldowns.
The
shortest
is
Smite
with
40
seconds
and
the
longest
is
Revive
with
540
seconds.
Because
of
their
high
cooldowns,
the
use
of
a
summoner
spell
should
be
use
in
a
tactical
way.
Distortion
reduces
the
cooldowns
of
Flash
,
Teleport
,
and
Ghost
by
25%.
Summoner
spell
cooldowns
CANNOT
be
reduced
by
regular
cooldown
reduction
from
items
such
as
Fiendish
Codex
.
Item
cooldowns
Items
with
active
abilities
,
such
as
Deathfire
Grasp
and
Youmuu's
Ghostblade
,
contain
cooldowns
that
can
only
be
reduced
by
Artificer
.
These
are
unaffected
by
cooldown
reduction
.
Items
with
passive
effects
with
cooldown,
such
as
Guardian
Angel
or
Guinsoo's
Rageblade
,
are
not
reduced
by
Artificer
or
cooldown
reduction
.
Items
of
the
same
name
shares
a
global
cooldown
among
them.
This
means
using
an
active
ability
of
an
item
will
send
all
the
same
items
to
cooldown,
in
both
your
inventory
and
shop.
For
example,
if
a
champion
with
3
Deathfire
Grasp
uses
the
activate
ability
of
Deathfire
Grasp
,
all
three
Deathfire
Grasp
will
go
to
a
60
second
cooldown.
In
addition,
buying
a
new
Deathfire
Grasp
within
the
60
second
cooldown,
the
new
Deathfire
Grasp
will
also
be
in
cooldown
until
the
remaining
cooldown
has
refreshed.
Different
items
with
similar
effects
do
not
share
a
global
cooldown.
A
champion
may
have
Hextech
Gunblade
and
Bilgewater
Cutlass
in
their
inventory
and
may
use
one
of
the
activate
effect
without
causing
both
items
to
go
on
cooldown.
