Institute
of
War
Accused
of
Conspiracy
Evidence
indicates
League's
manipulation
of
events
in
Kalamanda
Kaldera
Carnadine
reporting
from
Demacia
Garen
leaps
to
Katarina's
defense
when
her
sudden
appearance
in
Demacia
provokes
an
attack
from
the
Dauntless
Vanguard.
The
Institute
of
War
itself
has
fallen
under
suspicion
after
Prince
Jarvan
IV
and
Katarina
Du
Couteau
came
forward
yesterday
with
evidence
implicating
the
Institute
in
conspiracy.
Jarvan
and
Katarina
reportedly
followed
an
evidence
trail
left
by
General
Du
Couteau
to
conclude
that
the
Institute
may
have
been
directly
involved
in
sparking
the
war
between
Noxus
and
Demacia
in
Kalamanda
.
Jarvan
IV,
who
had
not
been
seen
outside
the
castle
since
his
return
to
Demacia,
emerged
yesterday
to
deliver
an
address
to
Demacian
citizens
and
representatives
from
the
Institute
of
War.
Onlookers
were
shocked,
however,
when
Katarina
Du
Couteau
emerged
at
the
prince's
side.
"We
feared
that
the
famed
assassin
had
targeted
Prince
Jarvan,"
stated
Myras
Thell,
a
soldier
of
the
Dauntless
Vanguard,
"We
attacked,
but
Commander
Garen
put
himself
in
the
path
of
our
blades
to
defend
her!"
The
prince
reported
how
he
and
Katarina
recovered
a
coded
rubric
in
the
Ivory
Ward
from
agents
of
Noxus
suspected
in
the
murder
of
General
Du
Couteau.
Katarina,
with
the
aid
of
a
letter
her
father
had
left
before
his
disappearance,
was
able
to
decode
the
rubric.
Its
message
directed
them
to
a
hidden
room
beneath
Demacia's
prison,
a
place
once
used
for
secret
meetings
between
Noxian
infiltrators
during
the
old
wars.
Within
the
meeting
room,
Jarvan
and
Katarina
discovered
a
series
of
documents
hidden
by
General
Du
Couteau
himself.
The
General
had
been
monitoring
a
series
of
transactions
related
to
the
DSS
Excursion
,
the
Demacian
ship
supposedly
sunk
by
Noxus
last
year.
"My
father
believed
that
Noxus
was
being
set
up
for
political
disaster,
so
he
took
it
upon
himself
to
discover
the
truth
behind
the
attack
on
Demacia.
The
transactions
and
orders
were
placed
by
a
list
of
names
that,
according
to
my
father's
notes,
lead
nowhere.
These
people
simply
do
not
exist,"
stated
Katarina.
"But
he
had
tied
their
point
of
origin
to
the
Institute
of
War."
Jarvan
and
Katarina's
further
investigation
had
revealed
that
these
names,
suspected
to
be
aliases
one
or
more
operatives
in
the
Institute,
were
used
again
in
orders
for
arcano-seismic
charges
from
Alowicious
Chucat
shortly
before
the
collapse
of
the
Demacian
mine
in
Kalamanda.
Similarly,
another
alias
was
used
for
the
purchase
of
Nyzer
poison
from
Zaunite
traders
shortly
before
the
death
of
Thom
Garvin,
the
prisoner
suspected
causing
the
mine
collapse.
"If
this
evidence
stands,"
Jarvan
stated,
"then
someone
at
the
Institute
manipulated
the
situation
between
Demacia
and
Noxus,
pitting
us
against
each
other
in
Kalamanda.
That
is
why
we
must
stand
together
until
the
League
itself
answers
for
this
injustice."
By
Jarvan's
direct
order,
Katarina
has
been
placed
under
the
personal
protection
of
the
Dauntless
Vanguard.
League
Champion
Talon
,
who
was
observed
during
the
presentation
of
evidence,
has
disappeared,
and
many
Demacian
citizens
assert
that
Jarvan
has
put
them
in
danger.
Demacia
has
erupted
into
heated
debate
regarding
the
collaboration
between
the
prince
and
a
representative
of
Noxus,
but
Jarvan
IV
himself
has
returned
to
the
confines
of
the
castle
and
has
not
commented
further.
The

The
events
in
Kalamanda
and
Prince
Jarvan's
claims
Aria
Breeker
reporting
from
Demacia
Citizens
of
Demacia,
yesterday
we
witnessed
our
crowned
prince
come
forth
at
the
side
of
Katarina
Du
Couteau
,
a
champion
of
our
most
hated
enemies,
against
the
Institute
of
War
itself.
I
have
witnessed
chaos
in
the
streets
before
the
castle
and
I
have
heard
whispers
of
dissent
at
my
ears.
My
fellow
Demacians,
I
plead
for
a
moment
of
peace.
Let
us
consider
what
we
have
heard
and
reflect
on
what
we
have
seen—from
the
very
beginning.

•
22
July,

CLE
-
Open
warfare
erupts
throughout
the
village
between
Demacian
and
Noxian
military
forces.
It
is
no
secret
that
Noxus
will
never
cease
in
their
tireless
efforts
to
sabotage
Demacian
honor,
but
I
must
ask
this:
what
did
Noxus
have
to
gain
in
an
assault
upon
the
DSS
Excursion?
What
use
can
necromancy
serve
in
an
attack
at
sea?
In
Kalamanda,
too,
we
witnessed
a
series
of
escalations
in
tension
between
Demacia
and
Noxus.
When
the
Demacian
mine
collapsed
by
sabotage
early
this
year,
the
arcano-seismic
charges
discovered
in
the
wreckage
were
of
Noxian
design,
and
the
death
of
Thom
Garvin
by
Nyzer
poisoning
was
easily
attributed
to
our
enemies
as
well.
Yet
if
the
purchase
of
both
of
these
things
has
been
traced
back
to
Institute
of
War
itself,
have
we
been
manipulated?
In
conclusion,
there
is
merit
to
the
Prince's
claims,
and
by
rallying
against
the
measures
he
has
taken—collaboration
with
Noxus—we
violate
our
prime
duty
as
citizens
of
Demacia.
If
the
Institute
of
War
has
acted
against
the
whole
of
Valoran,
justice
must
be
served.
We
stand
behind
our
leaders
in
the
face
of
all
treachery,
even
treachery
on
the
part
of
the
League
of
Legends
itself.
We
are
the
right
and
just,
and
we
remain
united
behind
Prince
Jarvan
IV.
In
the
pursuit
of
justice,
we
must
be
resolute
in
our
search
for
the
truth.
May
our
resolve
be
unwavering
and
our
righteous
wrath
unforgiving,
but
may
we
never
strike
without
cause.
Demacia:
now
and
forever.
Swain
returns
to
Noxian
High
Command
Master
Tactician
gains
support
in
the
midst
of
conflict
over
Grand
General's
successor
Kaldera
Carnadine
reporting
from
Noxus
The
turmoil
in
Noxus
following
the
death
of
Grand
General
Boram
Darkwill
intensified
this
week
when
Jericho
Swain
returned
to
High
Command.
Upon
his
arrival,
the
Master
Tactician
gained
the
immediate
support
of
Noxus's
prominent
military
figures,
positioning
him
as
the
strongest
rival
to
Keiran
Darkwill
for
leadership
of
Noxus.
The
seat
of
the
Grand
General
has
remained
vacant
since
the
death
of
Boram
Darkwill.
Over
the
past
weeks,
the
controversy
over
Darkwill's
succession
turned
to
outright
hostility.
Many
of
Noxus's
notorious
and
powerful
soldiers
stepped
forward
in
an
attempt
to
lay
claim
to
the
title.
Thus
far,
none
have
remained
alive
long
enough
to
maintain
control
over
the
city-state.
"It's
becoming
a
bit
of
a
bloodbath,
certainly,"
commented
Chancellor
Malek
Hawkmoon.
"But
this
is
a
Noxian
contest
of
strength
in
its
purest
form.
It
is
difficult
for
any
aspiring
General
to
prove
himself
without
war.
Those
who
try
their
hand
for
the
Grand
General's
title
do
so
with
Noxus's
oldest
tool:
raw
strength."
Keiran
Darkwill,
the
late
Grand
General's
youngest
son,
remains
one
of
the
more
ruthless
aspirants
in
this
dispute.
He
has
successfully
thwarted
several
assassination
attempts,
struck
down
his
challengers,
and
rallied
significant
support
behind
his
name.
Only
Darius
,
one
of
Noxus's
most
respected
and
feared
Generals,
has
earned
as
much
of
a
following
within
High
Command
as
Keiran
Darkwill.
Many
predicted
the
two
would
inevitably
clash
and
that
the
victor
would
rise
to
the
throne.
Upon
Jericho
Swain's
return,
General
Darius
forged
an
immediate
alliance
with
the
famed
Master
Tactician.
"Strength
was
once
the
very
backbone
of
Noxus,"
General
Darius
told
High
Command,
"yet
we
have
become
plagued
by
weakness.
In
Jericho
Swain
I
see
a
man
with
the
power
to
cull
the
weak
from
Noxus
and
unite
us
under
one
banner—and
united
we
shall
conquer
once
again."
"No
one
expected
an
alliance
like
this,"
Chancellor
Hawkmoon
stated.
"High
Command
is
now
more
divided
than
ever
between
Keiran
Darkwill
and
Jericho
Swain,
and
weapons
are
drawn
on
both
sides.
This
is
a
Noxus
we
haven't
seen
in
years—the
beast
has
awoken."

Superior
Summoner
L.B.
Briskes
commenting
from
the
Institute
of
War
Someone
--
who
by
appearance
I
judge
to
be
either
a
clinical
insomniac,
a
depraved
lunatic,
or
a
disillusioned
journalistic
intern
–
just
roused
me
from
a
relaxing
slumber
and
furthermore
a
lovely
dream
whose
details
I
can't
recall
beyond
Olivia
(my
weary
and
disapproving
secretary)
robbing
a
bank
in
a
rather
fetching
black
leather
number
to
afford
my
bail
for
crimes
which
were
undoubtedly
justified.
Where
was
I
going
with
this?
Oh
yes,
I
was
woken
because
Ralston
Farnsley,
our
studious
and
dedicated
Editor-in-Chief,
has
apparently
vanished.
Please
excuse
my
apparent
lack
of
concern
as
I
proceed
to
write
several
things
he
would
have
prevented,
had
he
been
doing
his
job
instead
of,
I
assume,
being
irresponsibly
passed
out
somewhere...
"As
a
summoner
of
the
League,
I
was
wondering
what
are
the
opinions
of
already
highly
regarded
mages
and
champions,
especially
Ryze
,
on
the
introduction
of
Xerath
to
the
League
and
his
magical
powers."
–
Summoner
Daniel
Narfalin
Well,
no
big
mysteries
here.
Mages
are
an
inherently
pompous
and
self-important
lot.
The
appearance
of
every
arcane
dabbler
on
the
Fields
of
Justice
is
always
followed
by
a
ritualistic
group
assertion
of
the
inadequacy
of
his
specific
talents.
Then,
if
the
rookie
hasn't
washed
out
or
accidentally
incinerated
himself
with
the
backwash
of
a
spell
(assuming
here
that
you
trust
Annie's
dubious
claims
of
non-involvement),
these
assertions
are
chased
by
insistence
that
the
new
brand
of
magic
is
somehow
a
perversion
of
everything
right
and
sensible
in
the
world,
and
completely
unlike
all
the
previous
perversions
which,
by
virtue
of
critical
exhaustion,
have
become
right
and
sensible.
This
said,
I
ferried
your
missive
to
Ryze
anyhow,
just
to
validate
my
point.
"The
creature
called
Xerath
is
an
abomination
of
a
mage.
To
master
magic
is
not
to
lose
oneself
to
it
entirely!
The
power
at
his
command,
however
great
it
might
be,
he's
holding
in
a
feeble
grasp.
His
own
will
can't
match
the
will
of
the
arcane.
The
ancient
mages
of
Shurima
did
everyone
a
favor
locking
Xerath
away,
and
the
Institute
of
War
would
be
wise
to
follow
their
example!"
"
Trundle
,
since
your
entry
into
the
League
you
have
borne
the
curse
of
the
Ruhgosk
tribe
alone,
seeking
a
means
of
dispelling
it
entirely.
Within
the
League,
there
seem
to
be
many
champions
capable
of
fairly
potent
healing
magics
-
Soraka
,
for
instance.
Have
you
spoken
with
her,
or
with
any
other
champions
versed
in
curative
magic,
about
the
burden
you
bear?
If
not,
do
you
plan
to?
Also,
do
you
have
anything
to
say
to
those
summoners
that
insist
upon
you
using
your
curse
as
a
weapon?"

Summoner
Aussarian
There
are
not
materials
abundant
enough
in
the
universe
to
build
what
I'd
consider
to
be
a
comfortable
barrier
separating
me
from
Trundle.
In
terms
of
things
I
make
a
point
of
avoiding,
he
falls
somewhere
between
my
work
and
the
clawed,
rabid
beast
that
a
woman
I
once
dated
turned
into
whenever
I
elected
to
forego
her
trifling
needs
like
birthday
gifts
or
mouth-to-mouth
resuscitation.
Fortunately
for
you,
Aussarian,
I
have
no
trouble
sending
Olivia
into
what
I'm
now
terming
the
"Underbelly
of
Filthmare."
"Y'gotta
understand
something,
summoners—it's
a
curse,
not
a
wound.
Yeah,
it
LOOKS
bad,
and
you'd
think
you
could
just
slap
a
healing
spell
on
it
and
it'd
clear
right
up,
but
it's
not
so
simple.
Believe
me.
Good
thing
is,
though,
healing
spells
help
me
out.
Ease
the
pain
a
little.
And
Soraka?
I'd
never
go
asking
for
a
handout,
but
Soraka's
almost
too
generous.
Good
healing
magic's
like
a
good
massage,
I'm
tellin'
you—and
nobody's
gonna
give
me
a
massage
these
days."

Were

Would

Mädchen,
Summoner
of
Noxus
As
I
understand
it,
Katarina
is
preoccupied
in
Demacia
(insert
speculative
tabloid
headline
here),
leaving
no
options
but
to
consult
her
sister,
the
only
woman
I've
known
to
attempt
molting
seductively.
As
I
dispatched
Olivia
to
Filthmare
I
needed
to
endure,
in
order
of
annoyance:
two
Noxian
assassination
attempts,
four
tasteless
advances
from
a
serpentine
diva,
and
countless
inquiries
from
outgoing
passersby
about
my
opinions
of
"this
weather
we've
been
having."
I
hope
Cassiopeia's
response
was
worth
it,
though
as
it
didn't
come
wrapped
around
a
large
bottle,
I
find
this
highly
improbable.
"My
sister
and
I
certainly
knew
him,
though
we
rarely
saw
the
boy...
he
kept
to
the
shadows
and
the
sewers
he'd
come
from,
and
he
took
orders
only
from
our
father.
On
occasions
where
we
worked
together,
it
was
by
order
of
the
General—though
I
can
think
of
uses
he
might've
served.
Whatever
he
has
done
alongside
Katarina
has
only
come
to
pass
because
they
share
the
same
goal:
Talon
follows
the
General,
and
the
General
only.
When
the
trail
left
by
my
father
ends...
I
can
only
wonder
if
the
loyalty
of
the
Blade's
Shadow
will
end
with
it."
