Ivory
Ward
Marketplace
Destroyed
Noxian
authorities
investigating
evidence
of
midnight
battle
Henril
Dreving
reporting
from
Noxus
A
midnight
battle
leaves
Noxus’
Ivory
Ward
Marketplace
in
a
state
of
ruin.
During
the
night,
a
battle
erupted
within
Noxus’
famous
Ivory
Ward
marketplace
late
last
week,
devastating
the
area’s
main
square.
Noxian
authorities
have
ruled
the
fight
a
political
squabble
related
to
the
turmoil
still
raging
in
High
Command
after
the
death
of
Boram
Darkwill.
The
black
of
night
shrouded
the
whole
of
the
Ivory
Ward
when
guards
responded
to
the
disturbance
in
the
marketplace
area.
The
Ivory
Ward
itself
is
one
of
the
oldest
and
most
wealthy
districts
in
Noxus,
and
military-assigned
guards
in
the
area
are
sparse
because
its
tenants
typically
hire
private
security.
Last
Thursday
night,
only
one
guard
was
close
enough
to
respond
to
the
disturbance,
but
he
arrived
too
late
to
apprehend
the
perpetrators.
“Cries
rose
up
from
behind
the
Morcef
District
wall,
where
I
was
patrolling,”
said
Larin
Daris,
“followed
by
the
noise
of
battle.
From
the
sound
of
it,
I
needed
reinforcements,
so
I
called
for
backup.”
Daris
and
his
men
arrived
at
the
scene
to
discover
a
wealth
of
destruction
from
the
battle
that
had
taken
place—debris,
scattered
wreckage
of
merchants’
stands,
and
blood—but
not
a
soul
in
sight.
“All
of
that
mess,
and
everyone
had
ditched
the
party.”
Noxus
has
seen
an
increase
in
outbreaks
of
violence
since
the
assassination
of
Boram
Darkwill,
as
his
death
has
High
Command
in
turmoil
over
the
rightful
successor
to
his
title.
The
power
struggle
has
trickled
down
into
the
rest
of
Noxus
as
citizens
take
arms
in
support
of
the
various
Generals
vying
for
the
seat
of
the
Grand
General.
“It’s
been
a
gradual
escalation,”
stated
High
Chancellor
Hawkmoon.
“We’ve
had
plenty
of
bar
fights
and
a
number
of
squabbles
between
military
units
under
different
Generals.
The
Ivory
Ward
is
home
to
the
oldest
families
of
Noxus,
and
they
hold
a
great
deal
of
sway.
But
the
problem
of
filling
the
Grand
General’s
seat
has
everyone
divided.
Whatever
happened
that
night
is
tied
to
what
is
happening
in
the
halls
of
High
Command.”
The
compromised
marketplace
remains
under
investigation
by
Noxian
authorities,
and
residents
of
the
Ivory
Ward
have
drastically
increased
their
security.
No
casualties
have
been
confirmed,
but
one
merchant
whose
stock
was
destroyed,
Vexus
Nirac,
has
not
been
seen
since
the
day
before
the
marketplace
battle.
“He
may
have
been
involved,
and
in
that
case,
any
information
we
may
gain
from
him
would
be
of
value.
I
understand
that
there
is
an
order
out
for
his
arrest,
but
thus
far,
his
whereabouts
remain
unknown.”
Alowicious
Chucat
Dies
in
Magical
Fire
Lead
Archaeologist
of
the
Arcanum
Majoris
Succeeded
by
Ramune
Numer
Kaldera
Carnadine
reporting
from
the
Institute
of
War
Lead
Archaeologist
and
Master
Artificer
Alowicious
Chucat
was
killed
last
night
when
a
magical
explosion
set
Chucat’s
study
and
the
entire
eastern
wing
of
the
Arcanum
Majoris
ablaze.
Authorities
say
that
he
had
been
working
on
a
commission
for
the
League
which
went
destructively
awry
after
a
misstep
in
his
experimentation.
Artificers
at
the
Arcanum
Majoris
stated
that
Chucat
had
been
commissioned
by
the
League
to
rework
and
retune
an
existing
League-sanctioned
artifact
for
use
on
the
Field
of
Justice
.
“We
receive
tasks
like
this
quite
frequently,”
said
Doan
Whitker,
an
Assistant
Artificer.
“It’s
difficult
work,
but
it
is
not
usually
considered
dangerous.
The
only
real
difference
is
that
Chucat
had
been
working
on
something
that
had
been
previously
decommissioned,
but
that
doesn’t
explain
this
kind
of
reaction.”
The
unexpected
blast
from
Chucat’s
experiment
immediately
incinerated
everything
in
his
study
and
spread
to
the
adjacent
hallway.
The
other
residents
of
the
eastern
wing
were
able
to
extinguish
the
fire
and
quell
the
loosed
wild
magic
that
drove
it.
Chucat,
however,
did
not
escape,
and
his
death
was
confirmed
an
hour
after
the
accident.
“He
was
always
straying
a
bit
too
far
towards
danger,”
said
Meriz
Claudren,
one
of
Chucat’s
assistant
artifact
inspectors.
“It
was
the
Zaunite
blood
in
him,
I
think—he
liked
to
add
a
bit
of
risk
to
everything
he
touched.
In
his
archaeological
endeavors,
he
chose
the
most
dangerous
dig
sites—nearly
always
south
of
the
Great
Barrier.
As
an
Artificer,
he
invented
the
Manamune
by
accident
experimenting
on
a
design
with
a
blueprint
vastly
different
than
the
final
item.”
While
the
Institute
of
War
has
entered
a
period
of
mourning,
the
Arcanum
Majoris
has
named
Ramune
Numer,
a
long-standing
League
Artificer
and
friend
of
Chucat,
as
the
successor
to
the
late
Lead
Archeologist.
Numer
has
accepted
the
title
with
great
humility,
pledging
to
complete
all
of
Chucat’s
remaining
affairs
before
tending
to
his
own.
”I’ll
begin
with
the
item
Chucat
was
working
on
at
the
time
of
his
death—from
the
remnants
discovered
in
his
study,
it
appears
to
be
the
decommissioned
Locket
,”
stated
Ramune
Numer.
“I
will
see
Alowicious
Chucat’s
work
completed.
The
man
would
have
wanted
it
that
way:
his
greatest
pleasure
always
was
seeing
his
endeavors
come
to
fruition.”

Tobias
Drumm
reporting
from
Freljord
Ah,
Freljord
,
my
home
of
homes.
Any
man
who’s
ever
sprinted
along
the
frozen
steppes
of
this
land
with
an
icy
tundra
breeze
in
his
hair
will
tell
you
that
there
is
a
reason
that
we
settled
these
inhospitable
wilds.
For
a
man
of
action,
there’s
no
better
home
than
her
frosty
crags
and
frozen
pine
forests.
Nature
rules
in
Freljord,
and
each
day
is
another
blessing
from
Runeterra
herself.
Of
course,
when
a
cold
day
here
in
the
North
chills
you
to
the
bone,
nothing
soothes
your
cold,
aching
limbs
better
than
a
stiff
drink.
And,
as
the
fates
would
have
it,
there’s
never
been
a
better
time
to
get
one
in
Freljord.
Gragas,
the
Rabble
Rouser
,
has
made
the
journey
to
the
Avarosa
Iceflow,
Freljord’s
Northern-most
glacier
in
search
of
the
purest
waters
in
all
of
Runeterra
.
Atop
this
wellspring,
he
is
constructing
the
first
large
scale
brewing
operation
for
what
may
be
his
most
famous
libation:
the
legendary
Graggy
Ice.
The
League
champion
arrived
not
more
than
a
week
ago
with
a
mind
to
stake
his
claim
to
this
arid
ice
field.
Meeting
with
our
liege
and
lady,
King
Tryndamere
and
Queen
Ashe
,
the
Rabble
Rouser
impressed
upon
his
hosts
the
significance
of
this
far-flung
locale
to
his
brewing
art,
imploring
them
to
entrust
it
into
his
custody.
Seizing
the
opportunity
to
capitalize
on
the
development
of
an
otherwise
treacherous
territory,
our
wise
monarchs
were
more
than
happy
to
oblige.
And
so
it
came
to
pass
that
Gragas
signed
an
agreement
to
lease
the
Avarosa
Iceflow
from
Freljord
for
an
astonishing
9,000
years,
ensuring
that
this
cherished
water
supply
will
be
his
for
the
brewing
long
into
the
future.
His
dealings
with
our
leaders
were
then
concluded
appropriately
and
according
to
tradition:
with
a
drink.
Construction
on
his
new
brew
house
–
which
will
be
built
nearly
entirely
out
of
the
ice
itself
–
has
already
begun,
and
specially
machined
stills
designed
by
Gragas’
business
partner
Singed,
the
Mad
Chemist
,
arrived
in
Freljord
port
this
morning.
In
his
zeal
to
complete
the
project,
the
Rabble
Rouser
has
recruited
nearly
every
transport
agency
in
the
city
to
help
move
his
precious
cargo
north
through
the
mountains
to
the
build
site
regardless
of
their
asking
price.
With
these
new
plans
here
in
the
North
so
soon
following
the
conclusion
of
his
dealings
in
Zaun,
one
cannot
help
but
wonder
what
has
prompted
the
formerly
reclusive
champion
to
transform
so
quickly
from
isolationist
to
global
entrepreneur.
One
thing
is
certain:
Freljord
will
doubtless
be
toasting
to
the
Rabble
Rouser’s
name
in
the
coming
months.

Senior
Summoner
Ralston
Farnsley
commenting
from
the
Institute
of
War
This
week,
we
at
the
Institute
of
War
find
ourselves
beset
upon
by
the
tragedy
that
is
Alowicious
Chucat’s
unfortunate
demise.
The
late
Lead
Archaeologist
had
a
small
hand
in
designating
what
artifacts
and
items
would
be
available
for
use
on
the
Crystal
Scar
.
We
carry
his
memory
with
us
always
as
the
League
of
Legend’s
newest
Field
of
Justice
grows
nearer
and
nearer
to
completion.
“
Anivia
,
you
have
seen
your
world
reborn
numerous
times
and
have
lived
for
eons,
what
is
your
stance
on
the
events
in
Kalamanda
?
What
wisdom
can
you
share
with
the
League
and
it's
summoners
?
How
might
the
other
elementals
of
your
home
world
see
the
current
events
across
Valoran
?”
–
Elemental
Summoner
Outside
of
the
Field
of
Justice,
the
Cryophoenix
is
an
elusive
creature.
However,
I
managed
to
catch
her
attention
at
the
Institute
of
War
earlier
this
week
as
she
accompanied
Nunu
,
the
League
Emissary
of
Freljord,
to
a
routine
gathering
of
other
diplomats.
Her
response
to
your
question
was
as
follows:
“I
have
seen
much
chaos
and
turmoil
over
the
course
of
my
existence.
What
happened
in
Kalamanda,
while
it
does
sadden
me,
is
but
a
simple
mark
of
this
world’s
naivety.
Valoran
and
its
League
of
Legends
have
only
just
begun
their
journey.
I
am
certain
the
beings
of
my
home
world
would
share
my
belief
that
Kalamanda
is
the
first
trial
on
a
long
path.
I
am
uncertain
of
where
that
path
may
lead,
but
I
have
faith
in
Valoran
and
its
people
that
our
steps,
after
this
event,
will
be
measured,
careful,
and
purposed.”
“
Kassadin
is
one
of
the
few
who
have
ventured
to
Icathia
and
survived,
taking
the
Void
into
himself
as
to
better
defend
Valoran
from
the
extradimensional
threat
it
poses.
Aside
from
his
lone
efforts,
has
he
appealed
to
anyone
else
to
aid
him
in
his
quest?
Though
his
strength
is
something
which
demands
respect,
he
can't
hope
to
challenge
the
likes
of
Cho'Gath
,
Malzahar
and
his
cultists,
and
Kog'Maw
on
his
own,
surely.
The
defense
of
Valoran
seems
like
a
respectable
goal,
are
there
any
organizations
in
place
to
defend
against
this
alien
threat?”
–
Mädchen,
Summoner
of
Noxus
The
‘alien
threat’
you
speak
of
has
certainly
garnered
a
considerable
amount
of
attention
since
Kassadin
and
Malzahar
became
such
public
figures
through
the
League
of
Legends.
It
is
somewhat
fascinating
how
the
elaborate
lie
that
is
this
‘Void’
manages
to
perpetuate
regardless
of
its
obvious
falsity.
In
the
same
way
that
Malzahar’s
‘prophecies’
have
gained
him
followers
across
Valoran,
Kassadin
himself
has
inspired
a
strange
fervor
in
others
to
combat
the
Prophet’s
growing
‘forces.’
Following
in
the
path
of
Kassadin
himself,
these
people
have
pledged
their
lives
to
an
imaginary
war.
Stranger
still
is
the
fact
that
many
of
these
warriors—“preservers”
of
Valoran,
if
you
will—are
quite
powerful
individuals.
The
League
of
Legends
allows
them
to
go
about
their
business
as
they
please,
but
know
that
we
do
not
turn
a
blind
eye
to
even
the
strangest
events
in
this
land
we
seek
to
protect.
“We've
heard
of
the
Raedsel,
even
seen
them
in
action
against
the
Demacian
Vanguard
but
a
lot
about
them
remains
unknown.
Why
do
they
have
four
glowing
eyes?
Are
they
no
longer
human?
Is
it
an
enchantment
for
intimidation
purposes?
Is
it
possible
their
attire
is
directly
influenced
by
General
Swain
or
is
it
simply
Noxian
custom?
Perhaps
either
the
journal
or
a
League
champion
could
give
more
information.”
–
Summoner
Nwol
The
Raedsel
Guard
is,
as
far
as
history
knows,
the
longest-standing
military
unit
in
Noxus.
During
the
early
years
of
Boram
Darkwill’s
reign,
he
had
beneath
him
a
ruthless
subordinate—a
General
called
Zariv
Raedsel.
The
man
was
fearsomely
violent
and
unforgiving.
Noxian
soldiers
chosen
to
serve
in
his
unit
were
first
subjected
to
personal
combat
with
Raedsel,
and
it
is
said
that
he
executed
any
man
who
could
not
at
least
draw
blood
against
him.
Despite
this,
those
who
survived
became
fervently
devoted
to
the
man.
On
the
battlefield,
Raedsel
did
indeed
wear
an
enchanted
four-eyed
helm,
which
gave
him
an
inhuman
appearance
and
earned
him
the
title
“the
Noxian
Horror.”
While
he
was
certainly
one
of
the
most
revered
Generals
in
Noxus,
Zariv
Raedsel
desired
more
power
than
he
was
capable
of
claiming.
In
the
tradition
of
Noxus,
he
challenged
Boram
Darkwill
for
the
seat
of
the
Grand
General.
Darkwill
prevailed,
however,
and
executed
Raedsel,
claiming
the
General’s
unit
as
his
own.
Noxus
celebrates
those
that
seek
to
claim
power:
in
honor
of
the
man
who
embodied
the
ideals
of
Noxus
to
his
very
core,
the
Raedsel
Guard,
to
this
day,
wear
armor
in
his
likeness.
