Lore
An
unforgiving
barren
tundra,
Lokfar
is
a
place
where
all
creatures
must
vie
bitterly
for
every
resource.
Culture
In
the
lands
of
Lokfar
there
exists
a
long
tradition
of
soldiers
unlike
most
others.
Berserkers,
as
they
call
themselves,
are
warriors
who
channel
fury
from
deep
within
their
cores,
unleashing
pure
and
savage
wrath
upon
their
enemies.
The
seafaring
berserker
clans
are
known
for
ruthlessly
pillaging
any
and
all
villages
within
reach
of
their
dragon-crested
longboats.
Olaf,
the
Berserker
,
does
not
trust
the
summoners
who
run
the
Institute
of
War
.
He
deliberately
keeps
details
of
his
life
and
home
from
them.
What
is
known
is
that
their
lands
are
not
privy
to
the
powerful
magicians
that
can
be
found
on
Valoran,
with
their
military
strength
primarily
comprised
of
warriors.
Seafaring
marauders
are
also
said
to
plague
the
continent,
stealing
treasures
from
those
unlucky
enough
to
catch
their
attention.
History
There
is
no
reliable
source
on
whether
Lokfar
was
affected
by
the
Rune
Wars.
Brand,
the
Burning
Vengeance
,
has
stated
that
all
of
Runeterra
was
"
cleansed
by
the
purity
of
fire
",
indicating
that
the
entire
world
may
have
been
affected
by
the
wars,
or
possibly
by
some
other
unknown
catastrophe.
