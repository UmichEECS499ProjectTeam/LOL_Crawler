Kevin's
path
to
game
design
took
a
more
circuitous
route
than
most.
After
high
school,
Kevin
enrolled
in
the
Wexford
University
of
Combat
Butlery
in
Kilkenny,
IE.
Unfortunately,
he
failed
his
advanced
cutlery
combat
course
on
the
basis
of
stylist
approach.
While
his
"2
sporks,
4
threats"
style
did
allow
him
to
destroy
all
opponents
in
the
in-class
tournament,
the
spork
was
deemed
ineligible
for
use
on
the
basis
of
it
being
an
unsophisticated
weapon
inappropriate
for
a
high-class
combatant.
He
then
enrolled
at
Cal
State
Stanlisaus,
earning
a
bachelor's
degree
in
Psychology,
which
he
put
to
good
use
by
supporting
himself
through
online
poker.
Special
Ability
Pugilistic
Reckoning
:
When
he
feels
as
though
his
integrity
has
come
under
undue
scrutiny,
Kevin's
European
education
will
take
over.
Instinctively,
he
will
select
the
nearest
offending
target
and
proclaim:
"You,
sir,
have
sullied
my
honor!
I
challenge
you
to
fisticuffs!"
It
has
been
said
that
Kevin's
unarmed
combat
skills
rival
those
of
even
the
famed
brawler
Russell
Crowe.
