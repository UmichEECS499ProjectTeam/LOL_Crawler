Storm
Shield
The
Greater
Relics
The
Greater
Relic
(often
referred
to
as
the
Storm
Shield,
which
is
actually
the
buffs
it
provides)
is
a
stationary
object
placed
in
an
always-visible
area
at
the
center
of
the
Crystal
Scar
that
provides
two
strong,
individual
buffs
to
a
champion
that
claims
it:
Storm
Shield
Shield
and
Storm
Shield
Lightning
Obtaining
The
Greater
Relics
are
two
team-specific
buffs,
so
while
players
are
able
to
contest
an
enemy
who
is
attempting
to
claim
their
team's
Greater
Relic,
they
cannot
in
turn
steal
the
enemy
team's
buff
for
their
own
advantage.
Greater
Relics
initially
spawn
at
the
3
minute
mark
and
has
a
re-spawn
timer
of
3
minutes.
To
obtain
the
Storm
Shield
buffs,
a
champion
must
click
on
it
and
channel
for
three
seconds;
any
damage
that
the
champion
receives
during
this
time
will
immediately
interrupt
and
reset
the
channel.
Buff
The
Greater
Relic
buffs
will
increase
your
champion's
size
for
its
duration,
granting
extra
range
on
their
auto
attacks.
Storm
Shield:
Shield
grants
an
absorption
shield
that
will
recharge
if
the
champion
doesn't
receive
damage
for
10
seconds.
Storm
Shield:
Lightning
allows
the
champion
to
passively
detonate
a
lightning
blast
inflicting
90
(10
x
level)
magic
damage
on
the
champion's
autoattacks
and
damaging
spells
with
a
4
second
cooldown.
Patch
History
V1.0.0.136
:
Fixed
a
bug
where
the
Dominion
center
buff
could
cause
double
kills
against
Kog'Maw
,
Karthus
,
etc.
