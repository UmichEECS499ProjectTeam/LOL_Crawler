Abilities
Renekton's
abilities
have
no

and
with
the
use
of
some

his
abilities.

has
50
or
more
Fury,
his
next
ability
will
consume
50
Fury
for
an
enhanced
effect.
Fury
will
decay
at
a
rate
of
5

2
seconds
if
Renekton
has
not
dealt
or
received
damage
in
the
last
12
seconds.

Ability
Details
Ruthless
Predator
is
an
autoattack
modifier
ability.
Does
not
apply
spell
effects
.
The
triggering
attack
will
apply
other
on-hit
effects
and
can
critically
strike
as
normal.
As
with
most
on-hit
physical
damage,
the
bonus
damage
from
Ruthless
Predator
will
apply
life
steal
.
Critical
strikes
will
only
apply
to
the
first
attack.
Ruthless
Predator's
bonus
damage
will
not
affect
structures.
Ruthless
Predator
will
not
damage
a
target
if
Renekton
is
blinded
,
but
the
stun
will
still
apply.
PENDING
FOR
TEST
Ruthless
Predator's
relationship
with
dodge
,
parry
and
block
has
yet
to
be
tested.
Spell
shields
will
block
the
ability.
Additional
Information:
Ruthles
Predator
resets
Renekton's
attack
timer
on
cast.
Ruthless
Predator
has
a
0.5
second
cast
time
upon
use
during
which
Renekton
cannot
move
or
cast
spells.
He
can,
however,
cast
summoner
spells
and
item
actives.
If
the
item
active
uses
an
animation
(such
as
Tiamat
),
it
will
override
that
of
Ruthless
Predator.
This
is
the
only
way
to
reduce
the
cast
time
on
the
ability.

is
a
self-
buff
point-blank
area
of
effect
ability.
Applies
spell
effects
as
an
area
of
effect
ability.
Spell
vamp
is

not
block
the
ability.
Additional
Information:
Dominus'
health
bonus
is
a
direct
increase
to
Renekton's
maximum
health;
it
is
not
a
heal
and
is
thus
unaffected
by
Grievous
Wounds
and
similar
effects.
When
the
effects
of
Dominus
end,
Renekton
retains
the
bonus
health.
