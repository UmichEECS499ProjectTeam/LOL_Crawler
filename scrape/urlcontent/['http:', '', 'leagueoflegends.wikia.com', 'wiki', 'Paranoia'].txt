Ability
Details
Paranoia
is
a
global
debuff
ability.
When
activated
again,
it
becomes
a
single
targeted,
long
range
dash
ability.
Applies
spell
effects
as
a
single
target
ability.
Spell
vamp
is
fully
applied.
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
will
apply
a
35%
slow.
Spell
shields
will
block
the
sight
reduction
for
the
spell
shielded
unit
only
and
will
block
the
damage
of
the
dash.
Additional
Information:
The
first
cast
of
Paranoia
has
no
cast
time
and
does
not
interrupt
Nocturne's
previous
orders.
Nocturne
is
immune
to
all
crowd
control
while
performing
the
dash.
Paranoia
blocks
all
forms
of
sight,
up
to
and
including
sight
granted
by
minions
,
pets
,
wards
,
Clairvoyance
and
Twisted
Fate's
Destiny
.
Vision
granted
before
Paranoia
was
cast
will
be
removed,
and
vision
granted
after
Paranoia
is
cast
will
be
negated.
However,
Clairvoyance
and
Destiny
will
continue
to
grant
vision
for
their
remaining
duration
after
Paranoia
ends.
Although
vision
is
lost
across
the
map,
champions
will
still
retain
their
own
(but
slightly
reduced)
field
of
vision
and
can
spot
any
enemy
or
unit
that
they
could
see
normally.
Paranoia's
sight
reduction
does
not
grant
assists.
Nocturne
will
track
a
target
that
changes
location
such
as
by
moving,
using
a
dash
ability
or
using
Flash
.
He
will
not
follow
targets
that
move
a
great
distance
using
Recall
or
Teleport
,
however.
In
such
cases
he
will
simply
dash
to
the
target's
previous
location.
Paranoia
will
prevent
an
enemy
Shen
from
using
Stand
United
on
an
ally
while
it
is
active,
regardless
of
whether
or
not
he
actually
has
sight
of
his
ally.
This
includes
disabling
the
ability
to
cast
it
by
clicking
on
one
of
the
champion
portraits
on
the
left
of
the
screen.
