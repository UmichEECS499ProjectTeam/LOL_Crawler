Hotfix
A
hotfix
was
deployed
on
July
14th
related
to
issues
with
champion
filtering:
"We
have
just
released
a
hotfix
related
to
filtering
champions
in
your
summoner
profile
and
then
joining
a
Ranked
Game.
Previously,
if
you
filtered
to
only
view
certain
champions
(such
as
"tanks")
this
filter
remained
when
you
joined
champion
select.
This
has
been
fixed
for
ranked
games.
While
we
are
still
researching
the
issue
to
fix
it
with
normal
games,
please
be
advised:
if
you
join
queue,
then
filter
your
champions
in
your
summoner
profile,
and
then
join
champion
select
without
removing
the
filter,
you
will
be
limited
to
choosing
only
those
champions.
Please
turn
off
champion
filters
before
selecting
to
"Join
Champion
Select"
while
playing
normal
games."
