Magic
penetration
(or
spell
penetration
)
is
a
champion
statistic
which
allows
the
magic
damage
done
from
their
abilities,
enhanced
attacks,
etc.
to
ignore
some
or
all
of
a
target's
magic
resistance
.
All
champions
have
0
base
magic
penetration
but
can
increase
it
with
items,
runes
or
abilities
for
a
few
champions.
This
cannot
affect
enemy
magic
resistance
beyond
0
to
deal
bonus
damage.
Magic
resistance
reduction
is
the
effect
of
some
items
and
champion
abilities
that
temporarily
reduces
the
magic
resistance
of
one
or
more
targets.
This
allows
allies
to
benefit
from
the
reduction
of
magic
resistance.
This
can
reduce
magic
resistance
below
0,
resulting
in
bonus
damage
(see
Magic
resistance
).
Order
of
calculations
Magic
penetration
and
magic
resistance
reduction
work
exactly
like
armor
penetration
and
armor
reduction.
Magic
penetration
and
magic
reduction
are
considered
on
the
target
champion
in
the
following
order
[1]
:
Flat
magic
reduction
Percentage
magic
reduction
Percentage
magic
penetration
Flat
magic
penetration
Preceding
Preseason
3
Patch
Percentage
magic
reduction
Flat
magic
reduction
Flat
magic
penetration
Percentage
magic
penetration
Flat
magic
resistance
reduction
Flat
magic
resistance
reduction
stacks
additively
.
Example:
20
magic
resistance
reduction
reduces
the
target's
magic
resistance
by
20,
so
a
target
with
30
magic
resistance
will
be
reduced
to
10
magic
resistance.
(30
−
20
=
10)
Flat
magic
resistance
reduction
can
reduce
a
target's
magic
resistance
below
zero.
For
example,
if
an
enemy
with
10
magic
resistance
has
their
magic
resistance
reduced
by
25,
the
enemy
will
have
−15
magic
resistance.
Percentage
magic
resistance
reduction
The
target's
magic
resistance
is
multiplied
by
a
percentage
(100%
−
the
listed
reduction).
Percentage
magic
resistance
reduction
stacks
multiplicatively
and
is
ignored
if
the
target's
magic
resistance
is
0
or
less.
Example:
20%
magic
resistance
reduction
multiplies
the
target's
magic
resistance
to
80%,
so
a
target
with
30
magic
resistance
will
be
reduced
to
24
magic
resist.
(30
×
0.
8
=
24)
Percentage
magic
resistance
reduction
makes
a
bigger
difference
on
targets
with
higher
magic
resistance.
For
instance,
with
40%
magic
resistance
reduction,
a
target
with
200
magic
resistance
will
lose
80
while
a
target
with
only
50
magic
resistance
will
lose
20.
Percentage
magic
penetration
The
target's
magic
resistance
is
treated
as
being
multiplied
by
a
percentage
for
purposes
of
damage
calculation
(100%
−
the
listed
penetration).
Percentage
magic
penetration
stacks
multiplicatively
and
is
ignored
if
the
target's
magic
resistance
is
0
or
less.
Example:
20%
magic
penetration
causes
the
target
to
take
damage
as
if
its
magic
resistance
was
multiplied
by
80%,
so
a
target
with
30
magic
resistance
will
be
treated
as
though
it
had
24
for
purposes
of
damage
calculation
(the
target's
actual
magic
resistance
value
will
not
change,
however).
Because
the
target's
actual
magic
resistance
value
does
not
change,
anything
else
depending
on
that
value
also
doesn't
change
(e.g.
Galio's
Runic
Skin
).
Percentage
magic
penetration
makes
a
bigger
difference
on
targets
with
higher
magic
resistance.
For
instance,
with
40%
magic
penetration,
a
target
with
200
magic
resistance
will
be
considered
as
having
80
less
while
a
target
with
only
50
magic
resistance
will
be
considered
as
having
20
less.
Flat
magic
penetration
The
target's
magic
resist
is
treated
as
being
reduced
by
an
amount
for
purposes
of
damage
calculation,
but
cannot
be
reduced
below
0.
Flat
magic
penetration
stacks
additively
.
Example:
20
magic
penetration
causes
the
target
to
take
damage
as
if
its
magic
resistance
was
20
less,
so
a
target
with
30
magic
resistance
will
be
treated
as
though
it
had
10
for
purposes
of
damage
calculation
(the
target's
actual
magic
resistance
value
will
not
change,
however).
Because
the
target's
actual
magic
resistance
value
does
not
change,
anything
else
depending
on
that
value
also
doesn't
change.
Examples
Given
20
flat
magic
resistance
reduction
and
30%
magic
resistance
reduction,
and
the
target
is
affected
by
10
flat
magic
penetration
and
40%
magic
penetration,
Target
A
has
80
magic
resistance.
The
80
is
reduced
to
60
by
the
20
magic
resistance
reduction.
The
60
is
reduced
to
42
by
the
30%
magic
resistance
reduction.
The
42
is
considered
to
be
27.
3
by
the
35%
magic
resistance
penetration.
The
27.
3
is
considered
to
be
17.
3
by
the
10
magic
resistance
penetration.
Target
A
takes
damage
as
if
it
has
17.
3
magic
resistance.
Target
B
has
18
magic
resistance.
The
18
is
reduced
to
−2
by
the
20
magic
resistance
reduction.
The
−2
is
not
affected
by
any
further
calculations
because
it
is
less
than
0.
Target
B
takes
damage
as
if
it
has
−2
magic
resistance.

Notes
Magic
penetration
is
a
very
valuable
stat
for
casters.
There
are
few
sources
for
it
and
so
Magic
Penetration
marks
are
very
popular
runes.
Since
percentage
penetration
is
applied
before
flat
penetration,
it
is
highly
recommended
to
combine
both
statistics.
Commonly
only
one
of
Abyssal
Scepter
or
Void
Staff
is
built
depending
on
how
much
magic
resistance
the
enemy
team
is
using.
Magic
penetration
not
only
affects
all
champion
abilities
that
deal
magic
damage,
but
also
affects
magic
damage
items.
The
actives
on
items
like
Deathfire
Grasp
benefit
from
magic
penetration
as
well.
