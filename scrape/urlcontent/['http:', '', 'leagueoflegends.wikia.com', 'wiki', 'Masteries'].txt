Masteries
A
Mastery
is
an
area
that
a
summoner
is
able
to
focus
their
intense
magical
training
into,
categorized
into
three
specific
categories,
which
are
collectively
known
as
masteries.
Some
of
the
more
advanced
masteries
require
not
only
a
working
knowledge
of
previous
masteries
within
a
single
category,
but
also
the
knowledge
of
a
specific
mastery.
As
a
summoner
gains
levels
of
power
within
the
League
of
Legends
,
they
are
able
to
select
which
specific
areas
of
interest
to
focus
on.
Summoner
masteries
are
not
set
in
stone;
based
on
the
type
of
champion
you
wish
to
control
in
a
battle
arena,
masteries
can
be
changed
to
better
suit
a
summoner's
needs,
simply
by
pressing
the
"Return
Points"
button
to
completely
reset
your
masteries
and
allow
yourself
to
choose
others
in
which
to
spend
your
points
("re-spec").

Trees
There
are
three
types
of
trees
that
your
summoner
can
develop
in:
Offense
Mastery
Defense
Mastery
Utility
Mastery
Mastery
pages
Mastery
pages
were
released
in
patch
V1.0.0.118b
.
Mastery
pages
can
be
stored
and,
later,
chosen
similar
to
Rune
pages
during
champion
selection.
You
can
have
up
to
20
Mastery
Pages.
Attainment
With
each
level
achieved
by
a
Summoner
,
the
Summoner
also
receives
one
mastery
point,
capped
at
30
mastery
points,
the
maximum
summoner
level.
Each
mastery
takes
one
point
to
increase
its
level
and
each
tree
contains
at
least
37
points
worth
of
masteries,
so
even
at
top
level
the
Summoner
is
not
able
to
completely
fill
any
one
tree,
let
alone
all
trees.
This
adds
a
strategic
element
to
your
selection
of
Summoner
masteries,
as
you
can
choose
masteries
that
synergize
with
your
champion,
spells,
and
teammates.
It
is
important
to
note
that
most
masteries
require
points
in
the
tree.
When
moving
to
higher
levels
in
the
tree
(higher
"tiers"),
one
will
encounter
an
increasing
prerequisite
of
a
4
points
spent
in
that
tree.
For
example,
in
order
to
put
points
into
Alacrity
(a
tier-2
offense
mastery),
one
must
first
put
a
total
of
4
points
into
any
of
the
tier-1
offense
masteries,
and
to
put
a
point
into
Juggernaut
(the
tier-6
defense
skill),
one
must
have
20
points
in
other
defense
masteries.
A
summoner
must
have
at
least
21
points
(so
level
21)
to
acquire
the
last
mastery
in
a
tree.
The
last
mastery
is
usually
the
most
useful
and
vital
to
that
particular
mastery
tree.
Some
masteries
require
another
mastery
to
be
earned
before
a
higher
tier
mastery
is
available.
This
more
direct
type
of
prerequisite
is
shown
by
the
grey
lines
that
sometimes
lead
from
one
mastery
to
another
higher-tiered
mastery.
These
connected
masteries
usually
correlate
in
some
way.
The
lines
denote
the
fact
that
all
ranks
of
the
lower
tier
mastery
must
fully
acquired
("maxed
out")
before
the
higher
tier
mastery
will
become
available.
