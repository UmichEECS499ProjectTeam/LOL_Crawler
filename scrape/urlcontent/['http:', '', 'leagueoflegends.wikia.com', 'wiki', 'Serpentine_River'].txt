on
it

it
isn't
as
small
as
a
yordle.
The
Serpentine
River
is
a
river
in
the
Northwestern
part
of
Valoran
,
the
Summoner's
Rift
is
situated
on
both
sides
of
the
River.
The
epic
monster
Baron
Nashor
,
and
the
monster
Dragon
are
said
to
live
in
the
river.
According
to
the
map
of
Valoran
,
the
river
flows
out
from
underneath
Demacia
,
as
well
as
out
of
the
Howling
Marsh
and
the
Marshes
of
Kaladoun
,
beginning
at
the
top
of
Crystal
Scar
in
Kalamanda
.
These
three
main
tributaries
join
into
one,
running
through
Summoner's
Rift
and
ultimately
out
into
the
Kaladoun,
just
west
of
Freljord
.
