on

edge
of
the
AoE
will

and
enemies
close
to
the
middle
will
be
tossed
over
the
ball
towards
the
edge.
Command:

can
toss
enemies
through
walls.
If
the
Ball
forcibly
leashes
back
to
Orianna,
Command:
Shockwave
will
go
on
a
brief
cooldown
if
it
is
ready.
Notes
Orianna
is
accompanied
by
the
Ball,
which
is
the
focus
of
her
abilities.
It
attaches
itself
to
Orianna
if
she
walks
near
it
and
also
blinks
back
to
Orianna
if
she
is
too
far
away.
The
Ball
has
a
leash
range
of
1125.
Whenever
Orianna
does
not
have
the
Ball
attached
to
her,
an
arrow
will
appear
near
her,
pointing
toward
the
Ball's
location.
This
arrow
changes
color
depending
on
Orianna's
distance
from
the
Ball.
Green
(
Blue
in
colorblind
mode)
means
the
Ball
is
close.
Yellow
means
the
Ball
is
a
fair
distance
away.
Red
means
the
Ball
is
far
away,
and
moving
just
a
bit
further
will
make
it
blink
back
to
Orianna.
Using
any
ability
sets
off
a
0.
15
second
global
cooldown.
The
Ball
has
a
leash
range
of
1125,
or
1225
if
Command:
Protect
attaches
it
to
an
allied
champion.
However,
unlike
most
subordinate
objects,
Orianna's
Ball
is
not
targetable
by
any
means.
The
Ball
reveals
a
small
area
around
its
current
location,
approximately
550
vision
range,
allowing
it
to
be
used
for
scouting.
The
Ball
ignores
terrain,
and
can
be
placed
inside
terrain
such
as
trees,
walls
and
turrets.
