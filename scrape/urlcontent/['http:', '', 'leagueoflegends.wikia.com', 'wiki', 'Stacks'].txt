Stacking
refers
to
two
different
things,
depending
on
the
context.
When
used
in-game
or
in
an
article,
one
should
use
context
to
determine
what
type
of
"
Stack
"
or
"Stacking"
is
being
mentioned.
Effect
stacking
refers
to
a
single
effect
being
applied
more
than
once
on
a
target.
Champion
statistic
stacking
refers
to
how
champion
statistics
behave
when
modified
by
multiple
effects.
Effect
stacking
Champion
abilities,
summoner
spells,
items,
and
buffs
often
apply
effects
to
characters.
Simply
put,
an
effect
either
stacks
or
doesn't
stack,
though
aura
effects
are
an
exception
(see
§
Aura
stacking
).
When
a
non-stacking
effect
is
applied
on
a
target
that
already
has
the
effect:
There
is
still
only
one
effect.
The
duration
of
the
effect
is
reset
to
whatever
the
duration
is
of
the
most
recent
application.
When
a
stacking
effect
is
applied
on
a
target
that
already
has
the
effect:
The
number
of
stacks
of
that
effect
increases
by
one
(unless
the
maximum
number
of
stacks
has
been
reached;
e.g.
Soraka's
Starcall
stacks
up
to
10
times).
The
duration
of
each
stack
is
reset
to
the
duration
of
the
most
recent
application.
This
happens
regardless
of
whether
the
maximum
number
of
stacks
has
been
reached.
Specifically
note
that
each
stack
does
not
have
a
separate
duration;
each
application
of
an
effect
resets
the
duration
of
all
stacks.
Example:
if
a
character
has
1
stack
of
Soraka's
Starcall
with
3
seconds
left
and
has
it
applied
again,
the
first
stack
resets
to
the
full
5
seconds.
When
an
effect
has
more
than
one
stack,
the
effect
is
applied
that
many
times.
Example:
if
a
target
has
10
stacks
of
max-level
Starcall
,
the
target's
magic
resistance
is
decreased
by
12
a
total
of
10
times,
resulting
in
−120
magic
resistance.
Aura
stacking
Auras
are
a
special
case
when
it
comes
to
effect
stacking.
An
item
that
produces
a
friendly
aura
effect
produces
two
separate
non-stacking
effects:
one
on
your
champion
(named,
e.g.,
"Mana
Manipulator"),
and
one
on
allies
an
area
around
your
champion
(named,
e.g.,
"Mana
Manipulator
Aura").
These
are
two
separate
effects
despite
doing
the
same
thing,
and
can
therefore
stack
with
each
other.
Thus,
you
can
double
the
"aura"
effect
listed
for
the
item
by
getting
the
item
and
also
being
affected
by
an
ally's
aura;
duplicates
of
an
aura
item
on
your
champion
do
not
stack,
and
duplicates
of
an
aura
from
multiple
allied
champions
do
not
stack.
Champion
statistic
stacking
Some
in-game
values
can
be
modified
by
multiple
effects.
It
can
be
said
that
a
champion
statistic
stacks
additively
or
stacks
multiplicatively
.
Stacks
additively
When
effects
stack
additively,
the
cumulative
effect
can
be
calculated
simply
by
adding
together
each
effect.

Example:
if
your
champion
has
two
items
granting
+100
health
each,
your
champion
has
200
bonus
health.

Stacks
multiplicatively
When
effects
stack
multiplicatively,
the
cumulative
effect
can
be
calculated
by
multiplying
the
effects
together.
Note
that
the
game
interface
rounds
champion
statistics,
so
what
is
shown
in-game
may
be
slightly
different
than
what
is
calculated.
It
is
important
to
understand
that
most
champion
statistics
that
stack
multiplicatively
are
displayed
as
the
opposite
of
the
actual
numbers
that
are
multiplied.
For
example,
10%
damage
reduction
should
instead
be
understood
as
90%
damage
taken,
and
25%
damage
reduction
should
instead
be
understood
as
75%
damage.

Example:
If
your

has

and
an
item
granting
10%
damage
reduction,
you
multiply
the
damage
factors—0.9
and
0.9—to
get
0.81,
which
means
your
champion
has
19%
damage
reduction
(against
physical
damage).

Armor

a

to
the

of

Calculate
the
