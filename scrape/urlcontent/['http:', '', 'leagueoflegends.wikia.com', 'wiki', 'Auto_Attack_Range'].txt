Redirected
from
Auto
Attack
Range
Range
is
a
measurement
used
to
determine
how
far
an
autoattack
or
ability
can
reach.
It
shares
the
scale
with
movement
speed
,
so
one
point
translates
to
one
game
distance
unit
traveled.
Note
that
autoattack
range
is
measured
differently
to
ability
range.
Given
a
source
unit's
hitbox
and
a
target
unit's
hitbox,
range
is
calculated
as
follows:
autoattack
range
from
edge
to
edge;
targeted
skill
range
from
center
to
center;
skillshot
range
from
edge
to
edge;
and
the
range
of
self-centered
area
of
effects
are
from
the
edge
of
the
source
(the
larger
champions
don't
benefit
less
from
auras
than
smaller
champions).
The
difference
is
approximately
100
(i.e.
550
autoattack
range
is
roughly
650
casting
range)
[1]
[2]
[3]
Each
champion
begins
the
game
with
a
particular
base
autoattack
range.
This
can
vary
from
125
to
175
for
melee
units
and
425
to
650
for
ranged
units.
The
highest
base
autoattack
range
for
champions
is
held
by
Caitlyn
.
At
level
18,
the
highest
autoattack
range
is
703
held
by
Tristana
surpassing
Caitlyn
at
level
13
with
658
autoattack
range.
This
is
because
of
Tristana's
Draw
a
Bead
.
