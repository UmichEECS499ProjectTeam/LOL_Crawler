Trivia
Varus
was
designed
by
Meddler
.
[1]
Varus
is
voiced
by
Gavin
Hammon,
who
also
voices
Pantheon
and
Blood
Lord
Vladimir
.
Varus
is
a
medical
term
for
inward
joint
deformity
which
may
refer
to
his
current
"broken"
state.
Additionally,
the
curve
caused
by
the
deformity
is
similar
to
that
of
a
bow;
hence
the
term
"bowleggedness".
Varus's
Piercing
Arrow
is
a
rework
of
Tristana's
old
Draw
a
Bead
ability
which
(while
active)
would
reduce
her
movement
speed
to
increase
range.
The
League
of
Legends
art
team
worked
with
Gabe
and
Tycho
from
Penny
Arcade
to
make
a
"special
edition"
champion
sneak
peek
for
Varus.
[2]
Varus
was
the
first
champion
to
be
released
in
Season
Two
with
only
one
alternative
skin,
with
subsequent
champions
following
this
pattern.
The
Pit
of
Pallas
is
a
reference
to
Pallas
,
a
giant
associated
with
war
in
Greek
mythology.
He
was
killed
by
Athena
in
a
battle
with
the
gods.
Varus
is,
along
with
Caitlyn
,
Lissandra
,
Rumble
,
Vi
,
Xerath
,
and
Ziggs
,
one
of
the
few
champions
that
can
CC
themselves.
When
Varus
crits,
his
bow
expands.
Varus'
body
style
is
similar
to
the
one
of
Solus
,
the
T'Lan
leader
from
the
game
Breakdown.
Varus'
lore
and
namesake
could
be
a
slightly
inverse
reference
to
the
infamous
Roman
general
Publius
Quinctilius
Varus
,
who
foolishly
led
three
Roman
legions
to
their
demise
during
the
Battle
of
Teutoburg
Forest.
However,
the
Roman
Varus
commits
suicide
before
he
could
be
captured
by
the
defending
(albeit
ambushing)
Teutons,
while
the
Varus
of
League's
lore
defends
his
charge
but
loses
everything
to
the
Noxian
invaders,
to
which
he
vows
revenge.
Varus
is
right
eye
dominant.
Since
archers
traditionally
wield
their
bow
according
to
their
eye-dominance
rather
than
their
hand-dominance.
Varus
is
the
only
champion
since
Graves
to
receive
a
League
Judgement.
Varus
is
the
first
of
the
three
dark-themed
Ionian
Champion,
the
other
two
being
Syndra
and
Zed
.
He
shares
a
light
themed
skin
with
Syndra
.
Quotes
Varus'
quote,
"I
do
what
I
must."
is
similar
to
Lee
Sin's
quote,
"We
do
what
we
must
"
.
Varus'
quote
"Beware
a
man
with
nothing
to
lose"
is
based
on
an
Italian
proverb
"Beware
of
one
who
has
nothing
to
lose."
Varus's
quote.
"No
turning
back."
is
similar
to
Pulsefire
Ezreal's
quote,
"No
turning
back
now."
and
Irelia's
quote,
"There's
no
turning
back."
Skins
Classic
Varus
wields
his
bow
with
his
left
hand,
despite
the
splash
art
suggesting
he
aims
the
bow
with
his
right
hand.
Even
if
he
was
ambidextrous,
archers
traditionally
wield
their
bow
according
to
eye-dominance
rather
than
hand-dominance.
Blight
Crystal
Varus
might
be
a
reference
to
the
MMORPG
World
of
Warcraft
,
where
the
undead
would
use
Blight
Crystals
alike
to
the
ones
on
the
art
to
corrupt
other
creatures.
Varus's
quote,
"I
am
Forsaken."
is
also
spoken
by
the
undead
from
the
same
MMORPG.
Arclight
Varus
is
the
second
light-themed
skin
for
dark
Ionian
Champions,
the
first
being
Justicar
Syndra
.
It
has
been
stated
that
Arclight
Varus
is
how
Varus
looked
after
he
used
the
power
of
the
corruption,
but
"before
the
darkness
consumed
him".
Arclight
Varus
uses
the
same
voicing,
but
lacks
the
echo
effect
on
each
line.
Arctic
Ops
Varus
has
a
similar
design
to
soldiers
in
the
Battlefield
series
of
video
games.
Varus
shares
the
Arctic
Ops
line
with
Kennen
.
Relations
In
the
new
League
of
Legends
website,
Riven's
listed
as
Varus'
rival.
This
suggests
that
she
was
directly
involved
in
the
assault
of
Varus'
village
during
Noxus'
invasion
of
Ionia.
