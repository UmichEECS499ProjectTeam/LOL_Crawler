Archangel's
Staff
is
commonly
paired
with
Rod
of
Ages
for
many
ability
power
scaling
champions.
These
two
items
together
can
effectively
eliminate
any
champion's
mana
problems
and
the
early
Tear
of
the
Goddess
and
Catalyst
the
Protector
are
useful
in
lane
for
not
only
the
mana
regen
but
also
the
healing
sustain
and
increased
mana
pool.
The
only
downside
to
this
build
is
Archangel's
Staff
/
Tear
of
the
Goddess
as
well
as
Rod
of
Ages
take
considerable
time
to
stack.
Keep
in
mind
that
Rod
of
Ages
isn't
the
only
mana
item
that
synergizes
with
Archangel's
Staff
.
Lich
Bane
,
Iceborn
Gauntlet
,
and
Frozen
Heart
can
all
replace
or
be
added
to
Rod
of
Ages
depending
on
one's
champion
and
one's
team's
needs,
Lich
Bane
for
more
burst
and
Iceborn
Gauntlet
or
Frozen
Heart
for
each's
own
armor
and
utility.
By
building
a
full
set
of
items
giving
mana,
(fully
stacked
Archangel's
Staff
,
maxed
Rod
of
Ages
,
Iceborn
Gauntlet
,
Frozen
Heart
and
Lich
Bane
)
you
will
acquire
total
bonus
3150
mana,
which
will
grant
total
94.
5
bonus
ability
power,
not
counting
for
champion's
base
mana
rating
and
other
stats
given
by
those
items
indefinitely.
Archangel's
Staff
has
great
synergy
with
a
Rabadon's
Deathcap
,
as
it
increases
ability
power
by
30%.
This
means
that
whenever
your
mana
is
increased,
the
Archangel's
Staff
will
increase
your
ability
power,
and
then
the
Rabadon's
Deathcap
will
increase
it
again
due
to
the
30%
ability
power
passive.
To
gain
more
AP
from
the
Archangel's
Staff
than
a
single
Rabadon's
Deathcap
(which
gives
156
ability
power
if
alone)
a
champion
would
need
more
than
3200
mana.
However,
a
champion
would
only
need
2000
mana
for
the
Archangel's
Staff
to
provide
more
ability
power
than
a
second
Rabadon's
Deathcap
.
With
the
passive
of
this
item,
each
100
gold
spent
on
mana
at
base
efficiency
will
grant
additional
ability
power
worth
32.
625
gold.
Notes
Note
that
most
champions
have
around
800-1000
base
mana
at
level
18.
Not
counting
manaless
champions,
Vayne
and
Ashe
have
208
mana
at
level
one,
the
lowest
in
the
game,
which
combined
with
the
staff's
own
250
mana
already
equals
458.
Taking
into
account
the
time
(and
therefore
level)
it
takes
to
get
the
gold
to
buy
it,
it
is
practically
impossible
for
this
item
to
be
gold
inefficient.
Archangel's
Staff
grants
1
ability
power
per
~33
mana,
giving
a
total
of
67.
5
ability
power
at
zero
stacks.
It
gives
as
much
ability
power
per
gold
as
a
Needlessly
Large
Rod
at
2500
mana.
The
bonus
mana
does
not
stack
with
multiple
Archangel's
Staves
,
Tears
of
the
Goddess
or
Manamunes
.
Assuming
a
charge
is
gained
every
4
seconds,
the
750
mana
Unique
Passive
takes
6
minutes
and
16
seconds
to
max.
(The
Tears
of
the
Goddess
takes
12
minutes
and
32
seconds).
There
is
a
3
charge
banking
system
to
help
burst
casters.
Rammus's
Powerball
adds
one
stack
upon
cast
and
another
stack
if
ended
early
without
a
collision.
Similarly,
Janna's
Howling
Gale
adds
one
stack
upon
activation,
and
a
second
if
activated
early.
Singed's
Poison
Trail
adds
one
stack
whenever
the
ability's
toggle
is
active
and
the
Tear/Archangel's
Staff
stack
is
not
cooling
down
(ie,
continuously).
Manaless
champions
may
charge
the
Tear
of
the
Goddess
,
Manamune
and
Archangel's
Staff
to
get
Muramana
and
Seraph's
Embrace
.
However,
they
won't
get
any
bonuses
of
Muramana's
Awe
and
toggle,
as
well
as
Seraph's
Embrace
's
Insight
and
Mana
Shield
.
