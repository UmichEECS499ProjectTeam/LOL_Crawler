Utility.
Strategy
This
mastery
can
be
quite
useful
for
any
champion
jungling,
as
it
will
increase
your
experience
gain
in
the
jungle,
allowing
you
to
gank
earlier
and
keeping
you
around
the
level
of
your
opponents
(you
should
be
able
to
maintain
a
level
somewhere
between
your
solo
lanes
and
duo
lane).
Notes
This
Mastery
stacks
with
Zilean's
Heightened
Learning
.
