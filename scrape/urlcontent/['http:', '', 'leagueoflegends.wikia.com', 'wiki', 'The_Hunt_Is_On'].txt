The
Hunt
Is
On!
is
an
event
that
occurs
in
games
between
an
opposing
Rengar
and
Kha'Zix
.
[1]
A
video
describing
the
event
there.
The
event
begins
a
seemingly
random
length
of
time
after
the
following
conditions
have
been
met,
and
can
only
occur
once
per
game:
Kha'Zix
has
used
all
three
evolution
points
(minimum
champion
level
of
16).
Rengar
is
in
possession
of
his
unique
item,
the
Bonetooth
Necklace
.
Although
it
was
officially
stated
that
the
item
must
be
at
full
stacks
[2]
,
10
stacks
on
Bonetooth
Necklace
are
sufficient.
All
members
of
both
teams
must
be
alive
at
the
same
time.
[3]
Each
champion
is
assigned
to
kill
the
other
and
the
first
to
achieve
this
claims
victory
and
is
rewarded
(assists
count).
The
event
can
only
occur
once
per
game.
Rengar
The
Hunt
Is
On!:
Rengar
must
kill
Kha'Zix
first
to
become
the
ultimate
hunter
(assists
count).
Rengar
stalks
Kha'Zix,
his
greatest
prize,
and
the
one
beast
to
have
escaped
him.
If
Rengar
is
victorious,
his
Bonetooth
Necklace
is
replaced
with
an
item
called
the
Head
of
Kha'Zix
.
This
item
provides
the
benefits
of
a
fully
stacked,
permanent
Bonetooth
Necklace.
If
Rengar
is
successful,
he
gains
a
buff
with
the
title
"
Victory!
".
If
he
fails,
he
gains
a
buff
with
the
title
"
Defeat!
".
"This
twisted
monster
has
evaded
me
for
too
long.
I
will
have
his
head!"
―Rengar
Kha'Zix
The
Hunt
Is
On!:
Kha'zix
must
kill
Rengar
first
in
order
to
become
the
ultimate
predator
(assists
count).
Kha'Zix
is
ready
to
devour
Rengar,
his
greatest
prey.
If
Kha'Zix
is
victorious,
he
gains
a
fourth
evolution
point.
This
allows
Kha'Zix
to
evolve
in
to
each
of
his
four
abilities.
If
Kha'Zix
is
successful,
he
gains
a
buff
with
the
title
"
Victory!
".
If
he
fails,
he
gains
a
buff
with
the
title
"
Defeat!
".
"I
have
grown
and
adapted
since
I
took
his
eye.
I
will
feast
on
lion!"
―Kha'Zix
Notes
When
the
event
begins,
there
is
a
chime
and
players
receive
a
"Quest
Received"
notification
similar
to
the
Mark
of
the
Conqueror
quest.
The
event
can
only
occur
once
per
game.
If
both
teams
have
a
Rengar
and
Kha'Zix
,
the
event
will
begin
for
the
combination
who
met
the
conditions
first.
There
is
no
order
to
the
requirements.
The
event
will
begin
even
if
Kha'Zix
has
used
his
3
evolution
points
before
Rengar
purchases
the
Bonetooth
Necklace
.
The
event
will
not
begin
until
Kha'Zix
has
used
all
three
evolution
points.
As
these
are
attained
by
ranking
his
ultimate,
Void
Assault
,
level
16
is
only
the
minimum
requirement
as
Kha'Zix
is
not
required
to
invest
in
his
ultimate
at
levels
6,
11
and
16,
if
at
all.
PENDING
FOR
TEST
:
If
Rengar
sells
his
Bonetooth
Necklace
while
the
event
is
active,
the
event
will
end.
Rengar
can
sell
the
Head
of
Kha'Zix
for
2130
gold.
PENDING
FOR
TEST
:
If
sold,
Rengar
is
unable
to
reobtain
the
Head
of
Kha'Zix
.
The
Bonetooth
Necklace
can
be
repurchased,
but
it
won't
be
upgraded.
While
in
the
Public
Beta,
many
rumors
were
in
circulation
as
to
how
the
event
would
start
and
how
the
prizes
were
obtained.
Rengar
has
no
level
requirement
for
the
event
to
begin.
There
is
no
requirement
that
each
champion
must
be
level
18.
Both
champions
can
be
differently
levelled.
Neither
champion
is
required
to
score
a
pentakill
.
