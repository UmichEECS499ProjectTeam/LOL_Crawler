The

Perhaps
one
of
the
oddest
champions
in
the
League
of
Legends
is
the
Yordle
known
as
Amumu.
His
life
before
joining
the
League
remains
unknown...
especially
to
Amumu.
All
he
remembers
is
that
he
woke
up
alone
inside
a
pyramid
within
the
Shurima
Desert
.
He
was
entwined
in
mummy
wrappings
and
he
could
not
feel
his
heart
beat.
Furthermore,
he
felt
a
deep
sadness
that
he
could
not
entirely
explain;
he
knew
he
missed
his
parents,
though
he
could
not
remember
who
they
were.
Dropping
to
his
knees,
Amumu
wept
into
his
bandages.
No
matter
what
he
did,
it
seemed
he
could
never
stop
his
tears
or
sadness.
Eventually
he
stood
up,
determined
to
wander
the
world
to
discover
his
past.
Amumu
traveled
all
across
southern
Valoran
-
a
feat
that
is
not
easily
dismissed.
While
Amumu
still
hasn't
learned
much
about
his
past,
he
has
learned
a
great
deal
about
who
he
has
become.
He
is
most
assuredly
undead,
though
he
harbors
none
of
the
evil
characteristics
typical
of
undead
beings.
He
also
seems
to
keep
trouble
at
arm's
length;
Amumu
was
able
to
traverse
all
of
Southern
Valoran
without
so
much
as
a
single
bad
thing
happening
to
him.
He
was
just
sad,
and
the
people
and
beings
he
encountered
eventually
shared
his
sadness.
Ultimately,
he
made
his
way
north
across
the
Great
Barrier
to
the
Institute
of
War
,
the
home
of
the
League.
Amumu's
story
was
compelling
to
the
summoners
he
met
there,
and
they
invited
him
to
take
part
in
a
League
Judgment.
His
success
within
the
League
as
a
champion
has
given
Amumu
something
he
desired:
a
home.
With
his
present
(un)life
secured,
he
now
hopes
the
friends
he
has
made
will
help
him
discover
his
past.
"Things
are
bad
when
Amumu
is
crying,
but
they're
much
worse
when
he's
angry."
