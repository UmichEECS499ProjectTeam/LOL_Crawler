Mana
Potion
is
a
consumable
item
in
League
of
Legends
.
[1]
Consuming
a
Mana
Potion
will
restore
100
mana
over
15
seconds.
Mana
Potions
are
useful
early
game,
but
lose
their
effectiveness
from
the
mid-game
onwards
as
the
champion
's
maximum
mana
and
skill
costs
will
be
too
excessive
for
them
to
be
beneficial.
It
is
useful
for
all
champions
that
utilize
mana,
so
they
can
cast
abilities
more
often.

Notes
You
can
use
multiple
Mana
Potion
while
you
have
one
active
which
will
queue
them
up
to
be
used
after
the
previous
completes
(maximum
5
stacks).
Using
a
Mana
Potion
,
as
with
all
other
activated
items
(with
the
exception
of
Entropy
),
does
not
interrupt
channeled
abilities.
In
V1.0.0.147b
Mana
Potion
works
by
increasing
the
user's
mana
regeneration
by
roughly
6.7
mana/second
for
15
seconds,
which
effectively
restores
100
mana
over
the
duration.
As
a
consequence
of
this
mechanic,
Chalice
of
Harmony
unique
passive
will
stack
with
a
Mana
Potion,
increasing
its
potency
by
up
to
100%.

item
was
originally
called
