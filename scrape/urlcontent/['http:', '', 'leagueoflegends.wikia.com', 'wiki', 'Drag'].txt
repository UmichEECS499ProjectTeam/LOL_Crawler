Gameplay
Killing
the
dragon
grants
125-260
gold
to
each
player
on
the
killing
team
and
gives
experience
to
killer
and
nearby
allies.
The
killer
receives
25
bonus
gold.
It
is
described
in-game
as
"a
powerful
and
dangerous
monster
who
can
blow
fire
on
its
enemies
causing
damage
over
time
and
reducing
damage
dealt.
Slaying
this
foe
grants
global
gold
to
your
team".
If
the
Dragon
is
slain,
it
will
respawn
after
6
minutes.
If
the
killing
team
is
lower
average
level
than
their
opponents,
the
Dragon
grants
a
bonus
XP
of
+25%
per
average
level
difference.
Bonus
XP
is
sharply
increased
for
the
lowest
level
members
of
the
team,
+15%
per
number
of
levels
behind
the
Dragon
squared
(max
total
+200%
extra).
The
Dragon's
basic
attacks
deal
additional
physical
damage
equal
to
5%
of
the
target's
current
health
.
This
increases
by
0.5%
of
the
target's
current
health
per
level
after
level
9,
to
a
maximum
of
9.5%
of
the
target's
current
health
per
basic
attack.
The
debuff
from
the
Dragon
deals
60
true
damage
over
4
seconds
and
reduces
damage
dealt
by
20%.
The
debuff
refreshes
as
the
Dragon
attacks.
Background
Dragon
camp
location
in
Summoner's
Rift.
The
scent
of
chaos
fuels
the
flames
in
the
heart
of
the
Dragon.
Drawn
to
this
war-torn
land,
the
mightiest
of
beasts
has
settled
deep
within
the
Summoner's
Rift
,
awaiting
the
next
great
war.
To
those
who
wake
this
slumbering
ancient,
beware:
for
his
sharp
teeth
and
suffocating
breath
have
been
tempered
by
the
bravest
of
champions
,
and
yet
it
is
he
that
still
thrives
in
the
depths
of
the
Rift.
Strategy
Controlling
and
killing
the
Dragon
can
lead
to
a
gold
advantage
for
your
team.
The
125-260
global
gold
is
equivalent
to
approximately
5-20
minion
kills
for
everyone
on
your
team,
depending
on
the
stage
of
the
game.
So
killing
the
Dragon
is
roughly
equivalent
to
killing
38
creeps
(~
6
whole
waves)
and
distributing
the
gold
equally.
It
is
generally
considered
to
be
worth
as
much
as
1-2
champion
kills
,
making
it
a
very
high
value
target.
When
killing
the
Dragon,
check
that
the
enemy
team
has
not
warded
the
area
to
avoid
ganks.
Ganks
at
the
Dragon
are
in
fact
pretty
frequent,
as
your
team
will
be
weakened
by
it
and
with
limited
escape
paths.
A
good
gank
at
the
Dragon
may
result
in
a
lot
of
deaths
for
your
team,
with
the
Dragon
kill
being
stolen
by
the
enemies.
Try
to
keep
a
ward
in
the
river
near
the
Dragon
to
know
if
it
has
spawned
or
is
being
killed.
This
ward
also
provides
vision
of
enemy
champions
switching
between
the
middle
and
bottom
lanes.
Consequently,
you
should
consider
using
a
Vision
Ward
or
Sweeping
Lens
to
check
for
wards
before
attempting
dragon.
Killing
the
Dragon
is
one
of
the
jobs
of
the
jungler
.
He
may
require
help
from
the
team,
especially
from
the
bottom
or
the
mid
lane.
This
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
there
are
usually
2
champions
in
the
bottom
lane,
with
the
top
lane
being
solo,
when
there
is
a
jungler
on
your
team.
Fiddlesticks
,
Lee
Sin
and
Shaco
are
examples
of
junglers
that
are
capable
of
killing
the
Dragon
alone
at
early
levels.
Trying
to
kill
the
Dragon
before
level
5
as
a
jungler
is
generally
a
bad
idea.
Try
enlisting
the
help
of
your
mid
lane
and/or
bottom
lane
allies
temporarily
for
an
earlier
and
easier
kill.
"Pulling
Dragon"
(attacking
it
and
then
backing
away
to
lead
it
out
of
its
lair)
can
be
vital,
as
if
it
remains
in
its
lair
it
is
possible
for
an
enemy
champion
to
Smite
from
across
the
back
wall
and
steal
the
last
hit
if
they
realize
that
your
team
is
attempting
to
defeat
the
Dragon.
