A
Stack
can
refer
to
several
different
things,
as
both
a
noun
and
a
verb.
When
used
in-game
or
in
an
article,
one
should
use
context
to
determine
what
type
of
"Stack"
is
being
mentioned.
Different
types
of
"Stacks"
and
"
Stacking
"
are
included
below:
Stacking
Effect
Primarily,
when
someone
mentions
a
"Stack,"
they
are
speaking
of
one
instance
of
an
effect
which
can
multiply
itself
several
times,
effectively
"stacking
up"
it's
effect.
An
example
of
this
would
be
Starcall
,
which
applies
a
debuff
which
lowers
magic
resistance
upon
all
targets
hit,
and
can
stack
up
to
10
times,
meaning
that
repeated
application
of
the
effect
will
increase
the
intensity
of
it,
up
to
10
times
the
intensity
of
one
casting.
When
a
"Stack"
of
this
sort
is
applied,
the
duration
of
the
whole
resets
itself.
In
the
case
of
Starcall
,
the
MR
Reduction
debuff
lasts
for
8
seconds,
and
the
recast
time
of
Starcall
is
2.5
seconds.
However,
8
seconds
after
the
first
casting,
as
long
as
the
debuff
is
contually
applied
with
repeated
castings,
the
target
will
not
lose
the
initial
stack.
Instead,
all
of
the
stacks
will
remain
in
effect
until
a
full
8
seconds
passes
without
the
effect
being
re-applied.
After
this
time
period
has
passed,
all
the
stacks
of
the
effect
will
wear
off
simultaneously.
For
this
reason,
if
one
finds
oneself
inflicted
with
multiple
stacks
of
a
harmful
effect,
waiting
for
the
debuff
timer
to
pass
once
will
remove
the
entire
stack
of
effects.
In
the
same
vein,
to
keep
up
a
beneficial
stack
such
as
the
passive
effect
from
Monkey's
Agility
,
one
needs
only
refresh
the
fully-stacked
effect
once
each
time
it
reaches
the
end
of
the
duration,
or
they
risk
losing
all
the
stacks.
Items
with
Stacking
Effects
Several
items
have
passive
effects
which
can
be
stacked
up.
When
a
player
mentions
that
they
will
be
picking
up
a
"snowball
item"
or
that
they
are
"stacking
up"
a
particular
item,
they
mean
that
they
are
picking
up
one
of
these
items,
or
working
on
building
up
its
passive
effects.
Several
of
these
"Stacking
Items"
lose
some
or
all
of
their
stacks
when
a
champion
dies,
making
them
a
risky
choice
for
players
who
constantly
find
themselves
in
compromising
situations.
Examples
of
these
types
of
snowball
items
include:
Mejai's
Soulstealer
Sword
of
the
Occult
The
Bloodthirster
Other
types
of
stacking
items
permanently
gain
stats
and
do
not
lose
any
stacks
upon
death,
making
them
safer
choices,
but
typically
require
a
large
amount
of
stacks
to
reach
the
items
full
potential.
Examples
of
these
items
include:
Rod
of
Ages
Tear
of
the
Goddess
Archangel's
Staff
Manamune
Seeker's
Armguard
Still
other
items
do
not
gain
any
long-term
stacks
which
increase
their
permanent
effectiveness,
but
instead
place
a
stacking
debuff
upon
their
opponents,
or
gain
short-term
stacks
that
benefit
a
character
in
each
particular
engagement.
When
a
player
mentions
a
"stacking
item,"
these
are
usually
not
what
they
mean,
but
they
do
have
stacks
associated
with
them.
Examples
of
these
items
are:
Guinsoo's
Rageblade
The
Black
Cleaver
Sanguine
Blade
Wit's
End
Stacking
Multiple
Items
A
final
usage
of
the
term
"Stack"
or
"Stacking"
is
the
act
of
purchasing
multiple
copies
of
the
same
item,
or
multiple
items
with
a
particular
statistic
or
effect.
For
example,
if
somebody
purchase
three
Doran's
Rings
it
could
be
said
that
they
are
"stacking"
Doran's
Rings
.
Alternatively,
if
a
player
purchased
a
Giant's
Belt
,
Warmog's
Armor
,
and
a
Frozen
Mallet
,
it
could
be
said
that
they
are
"stacking"
health.
Stacking
items
or
stacking
a
particular
stat
can
help
to
build
up
a
strong
point,
but
it
is
generally
not
the
best
thing
to
do.
For
example,
while
stacking
Attack
Damage
may
seem
like
the
best
option
for
someone
who
does
lots
of
auto-attacking,
that
character's
damage
output
would
actually
benefit
more
from
balancing
a
variety
of
both
attack
damage,
attack
speed
,
and
armor
penetration
.
In
the
case
of
stacking
Doran's
Rings,
each
of
which
gives
fairly
good
stats
for
an
AP
Caster,
you
might
benefit
more
by
building
towards
powerful
endgame
items
which
may
add
more
beneficial
statistics,
such
as
higher
Ability
Power
or
Cooldown
Reduction.
