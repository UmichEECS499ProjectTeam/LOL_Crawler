A
rune
is
an
enhancement
that
the
summoner
provides
for
their
champion
before
a
match
on
a
field
of
justice
begins
to
augment
the
champion's
abilities.
Runes
can
only
be
purchased
from
the
Riot
Store
with
Influence
Points
.
Runes
cannot
be
purchased
with
Riot
Points
.
Each
rune
grants
a
small
bonus
in
a
specific
category,
which
stack
upon
each
other
to
grant
larger
bonuses.
Glyphs,
marks,
and
seals
stack
up
to
9
for
increased
effect,
and
quintessences
stack
up
to
3.
Purchasing
the
maximum
useful
number
of
every
type
of
tier
3
rune
(9
of
each
glyph,
mark
and
seal,
and
3
of
each
quintessence)
would
cost
397,620
IP,
encouraging
specialization.

Types
There
are
four
kinds
of
Runes,
with
three
levels
each,
a
Summoner
can
use:
Mark
:
Offensive.
Seal
:
Defensive.
Glyph
:
Magical.
Quintessence
:
Utility.
It
is
also
important
to
note
that
some
runes
are
"primary",
while
others
are
called
"secondary"
and
provide
lesser
bonuses.
Given
a
certain
kind
of
rune,
it
will
be
primary
in
either
marks,
glyphs
or
seals,
and
secondary
in
the
other
two
rune
types.
So,
all
kind
of
runes
have
one
primary
type
for
them
and
two
secondary
types.
The
aura
shrouding
a
rune
of
a
certain
effect
will
denote
which
rune
type
it
is
considered
primary
-
for
example,
ability
power
runes
will
have
a
blue
aura
showing
that
it
is
Glyphs
that
specialise
in
them.

Although
Quintessences
have
the
max
possible
effect,
you
may
only
have
three
instead
of
the
nine
marks,
seals,
or
glyphs
-
this
means
one
quintessence
should
be
equal
to
three
or
more
runes
in
order
to
qualify
as
a
"Primary"
Quintessence.
The
following
Quintessences
have
an
effect
equal
to
or
greater
than
three
primary
runes:
Ability

Tiers
The
Tier
of
a
rune
represents
its
relative
power
(i.e.
the
extent
of
the
bonuses
it
offers),
and
is
visible
in
the
top-left
of
the
pop-up
when
mousing
over
it.
Tier
1
or
"Lesser"
runes
are
dark
and
faded
with
visible
scratches
and
chips
except
for
Quintessences,
which
are
simply
purple.
Tier
2
don't
have
prefixes,
they
are
slightly
brighter
and
are
not
tattered;
Quintessences
now
have
gold
faces
and
purple
backgrounds.
You
can
buy
them
starting
at
level
10.
Tier
3
or
"Greater"
runes
are
brightly
lit;
Quintessences
are
completely
covered
in
gold.
You
can
buy
them
starting
at
level
20.
It
is
important
to
note
that
you
cannot
buy
a
Tier
3
rune
before
you
reach
level
20,
and
that
you
can
acquire
random
ones
for
less
IP
than
buying
them
outright
by
using
the
Rune
Combiner.
Five
"Lesser
Seals
of
Mana
Regeneration"
cost
75
IP
(5
×
15
IP),
while
one
"Seal
of
Replenishment"
costs
80.
This
equates
to
a
saving
of
5
IP.
Likewise,
a
combined
Tier
3
rune
would
cost
375
IP
(25
×
15
=
5
×
75),
cheaper
than
Tier
3
runes
of
costs
from
410
to
2050
IP.
This
equates
to
a
saving
of
35
IP
minimum
and
1675
IP
maximum.
The
cheapest
Tier
3
rune
costs
205.
This
equates
to
a
170
IP
loss.
Keep
in
mind
that
combining
5
runes
of
one
type
will
not
guarantee
you
a
better
(Primary)
rune
of
that
same
type.
The
Rune
Combiner
may
also
give
you
a
Secondary
Rune.
It
is
possible
to
combine
runes
to
higher
tiers
and
use
them
freely
even
if
you
are
too
low
a
level
to
buy
them
directly.
However,
it
is
not
recommended,
as
most
runes
aren't
that
helpful
(e.g.
hybrid
penetration
runes,
which
are
very
specific,
or
secondary
runes),
thus
the
best
long
term
strategy
is
to
start
buying
them
at
level
20
and
saving
up
Influence
Points
before
then.
Usage
Summoners
are
able
to
use
a
rune
per
level
of
power
in
League
of
Legends
,
and
they
keep
their
Runes
in
a
tome
called
a
Runebook
.
Before
a
match
begins,
a
Summoner
will
be
able
to
choose
from
up
to
twenty
different
rune
configurations
they
have
previously
set
in
their
Runebook.
This
allows
the
Summoner
to
have
quick
flexibility
in
choosing
a
Runebook
configuration
best
suited
for
whatever
champion
they
might
use
in
any
of
Valoran's
Fields
of
Justice
.
