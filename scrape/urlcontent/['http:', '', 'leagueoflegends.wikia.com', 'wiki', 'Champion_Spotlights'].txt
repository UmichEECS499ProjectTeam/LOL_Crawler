Champion
Spotlights
are
a
series
of
videos
created
by
a
Web
Content
Specialist
at
Riot
Games
named
David
'Phreak'
Turley
.
It
began
as
a
short
video
and
narration
by
Phreak
in
which
he
discusses
and
demonstrates
skills,
tactics,
and
strategies
of
a
certain
champion.
The
videos
were
well
received
by
the
community,
and
many
players
asked
for
more
to
be
created.
He
focuses
on
a
single
champion
for
each
video,
usually
showing
times
where
people
are
usually
likely
to
succeed
or
fail.
He
reviews
each
skill
and
the
passive,
demonstrates
where
they
are
useful,
and
why
he
uses
them
in
the
manner
he
displays.
Some
videos
have
included
one
of
the
character
developers
to
explain
more
in-depth
about
how
they
designed
the
character
to
be
used.
While
the
videos
have
been
an
initial
success,
there
have
been
come
complaints
about
old
videos
kept
on
site
or
on
YouTube.
Many
of
the
characters
reviewed
by
Phreak
have
undergone
buffs,
nerfs,
or
even
complete
character
overhauls.
This
causes
some
of
the
videos
to
be
misleading.
Riot's
page
on
the
videos
can
be
found
here
and
on
their
YouTube
channel
.
