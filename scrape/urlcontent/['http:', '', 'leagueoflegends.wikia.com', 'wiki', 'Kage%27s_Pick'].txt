Notes
Because
killing
minions
disables
the
Tribute
passive
,
Spellthief's
Edge
is
best
purchased
on
supports
who
are
able
to
harass
effectively
in-lane
.
The
damage
type
of
the
bonus
damage
will
match
the
trigger.
Area
of
effect
abilities
will
use
one
charge
per
enemy
champion
hit.
On-hit
effects
will
not
trigger
Tribute
(although
the
triggering
attack
can).
Damage
over
time
abilities
will
trigger
Tribute
once
per
instance
of
damage.
