Thresh,
the
Chain
Warden
is
a
champion
in
League
of
Legends
.
[1]
Abilities
Damnation
Thresh
does
not
gain
armor
per
level
.
Instead,
Thresh
collects
the
souls
of
dead
enemies
by
approaching
them
or
by
placing
Dark
Passage's
lantern
nearby.
Each
soul
permanently
grants
0.75
armor
and
ability
power
.
Champions
and
large
minions
and
monsters
always
drop
a
soul.
Small
minions
and
monsters
only
sometimes
drop
a
soul.
A
soul
will
only
drop
if
the
enemy
unit
dies
within
1900
range
of
Thresh.
Souls
are
visible
to
allies,
and
only
become
visible
to
enemies
if
the
enemy
team
has
vision
of
Thresh.
Souls
disappear
if
not
picked
up
after
8
seconds.
Ability
Details
Damnation
is
a
passive
ability
that
grants
Thresh
bonus
stats
.
Additional
Information:
At
level
18,
it
takes
67
souls
(roughly
four
per
level)
to
surpass
Orianna
's
62
armor,
the
lowest
innate
champion
armor
.
It
takes
140
souls
(roughly
eight
per
level)
to
surpass
Taric
's
Shatter
-enhanced
116.
6
armor,
the
highest
armor
possible
without
the
use
of
items
,
runes
,
or
masteries
.
On
Summoner's
Rift
,
the
drop
rate
for
souls
from
small
minions
is
33%.
However,
the
probability
adjusts
dynamically.
If
you
are
above
or
below
your
expected
quota
of
soul
drops
from
small
minions,
the
probability
lowers
or
rises
by
a
small
amount
until
you
are
back
at
your
quota
of
drops.
It
is
worth
stressing
that
this
only
takes
into
account
souls
dropped,
and
not
souls
collected.
At
255
souls,
Thresh
gains
a
new
buff,
"Soul
Gluttony".
Soul
Gluttony
states
that
he
has
gained
255
souls
as
well
as
how
much
ability
power
and
armor
that
is
worth.
The
Damnation
buff
disappears,
and
starts
again
at
1
from
your
next
soul.
This
will
occur
each
time
Thresh
obtains
255
souls,
with
Soul
Gluttony
updating
each
time
(e.g.
255,
510,
765,
and
so
on).
The
number
of
souls
caps
at
999,999,
at
which
point
Thresh
will
have
749,999
bonus
armor
and
ability
power.
This
amount
of
armor
grants
Thresh
99.
99
%
damage
reduction.
Even
with
the
35%
armor
penetration
from
Last
Whisper
,
this
amount
of
armor
grants
99.
98
%
damage
reduction.
Damnation
features
an
easter
egg
:
Nunu
will
drop
2
souls,
his
own
and
Willump's
.

After

Thresh
throws
out
his
scythe
in
a
line
and
forms
a
tether
with
the
first
enemy
hit,
dealing
magic
damage
and
stunning
it

While
the

persists,
Thresh
cannot
attack
and
he
will
periodically
tug
on
the
tether,
each
time
pulling
the
target
a
short
distance
toward
himself.
After
0.

hooks
a

loses
the
ability
to
activate
Death

when
the

Active:
Thresh
throws
his
lantern
to
the
target
location
where
it
remains
for
up

6
seconds.
If
an
ally
right-clicks
the
lantern,
they
will
pick
it
up
and
will
be
pulled
to
Thresh's
location.
If
Thresh
moves
more
than
~1500
units
away,
the
lantern
will
return
to
him.
For
the
next
6
seconds,
allies
who
come
near
the
lantern
(even
while
Thresh
is
holding
it)
gain
a
shield
that
absorbs
damage
for
up
to
4
seconds.
Allies
can
only
receive
the
shield
once
per
cast.

Ability
Details
Dark
Passage
is
a
ground-target,
persistent
area
of
effect
.
Additional
Information:
The
lantern
creates
a
small
area
of
impassible
terrain
while
on
the
field.
Enemies
in
the
area
when
the
lantern
is
summoned
will
be
nudged
to
the
nearest
available
space.
This
is
not
classified
as
crowd
control
(particularly,
it
will
not
interrupt
channelled
abilities).
The
lantern's
aura
radius
is
~150
units.
This
is
also
the
range
on
the
lantern's
ability
to
pick
up
souls.
The
lantern's
pick-up
radius
is
not
much
larger
than
the
model-size
of
the
lantern.
However,
it
is
possible
to
pick-up
the
lantern
through
small
walls
so
long
as
you
are
within
that
radius.
The
lantern
provides
vision
in
a
small
area
for
the
entire
duration.
Thresh
cannot
click
on
the
lantern
himself
but
he
will
be
shielded
if
he
walks
near
it.
The
lantern
can
be
targeted
by
Teleport
and
allied-targeted
dashes.
When
the
lantern
is
thrown
a
golden
circle
is
shown
displaying
the
maximum
leash
range
of
it.
Thresh
can
break
the
leash
range
returning
the
lantern
to
him
to
instantly
shield
himself,
if
he
has
not
been
shielded
by
the
ability
already.
An
ally
being
carried
by
Dark
Passage
will
be
taken
to
Thresh's
current
location,
not
Thresh's
location
when
the
ally
grabbed
the
lantern.

Details
Flay's
active
is
a
point-blank,
line
area
of
effect.
The
direction
of
knockback
is
determined
by
the
direction
of
the
line.
Also
it
passively
grants
an
on-hit
effect
.
Applies
spell
effects
as
an
area
of
effect
ability.
Spell
vamp
is
reduced
to
one-third
effectiveness.
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
will
apply
a
15%

The
triggering
attack
will
apply
other
on-hit
effects
and
can
critically
strike
as
normal.
PENDING
FOR
TEST
Flay's
relationship
with
dodge
,
parry
,
block
and
blinds
has
yet
to
be
tested,
both
with
regards
to
dealing
bonus
damage
and
resetting
the
charge.
The
bonus
damage
does
not
affect
structures
or
wards,
nor
will
those
attacks
reset
the
charge.
Magic
damage
will
be
mitigated
by
Black
Shield
and
Lifeline
.
Spell
shields
will
block
the
activated
damage
and
knock-back.
Additional
Information:
Despite
its
tooltip,
the
passive
bonus
damage
is
based
on
the
amount
of
time
since
Thresh's
last
hit,
not
his
last
attack.
As
the
bonus
damage
does
not
work
against
wards
or
structures,
the
bonus
damage
will
not
reset
and
will
continue
to
accumulate
even
while
attacking.
Runaan's
Hurricane
will
apply
the
passive
damage
to
each
enemy
hit.
However,
when
Thresh
strikes
one
of
the
enemies
the
time
since
his
last
attack
is
reset
and
the
other
two
targets
will
take
only
the
minimum
damage.
When
the
passive
is
fully
charged
the
icon
of
the
buff
becomes
red,
Thresh's
scythe
will
glow
green
and
there
is
a
sound
effect.
The

After

Thresh

5

around
him

up

seconds.
Enemy
champions
that
touch
a
wall
take
magic
damage
and
are
slowed
by
99%
for
2
seconds,
but
break
the
wall.
Once
one
wall
is
broken,
the
remaining
walls
deal
half
damage
and
apply
half
the
slow
duration.
An
enemy
can
be
affected
by
multiple
walls.

Ability
Details
The
Box
is
a
point-blank
area
of
effect
that
creates
five
walls
in
a
pentagon
shape.
Applies
spell
effects
as
an
area
of
effect
ability.
Spell
vamp
is
reduced
to
one-third
effectiveness.
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
will
apply
a
15%
slow.
Magic
damage
will
be
mitigated
by
Black
Shield
and
Lifeline
.
Spell
shields
will
block
the
damage
and
slow,
and
that
section
of
the
wall
will
shatter.
Additional
Information:
Movement
speed
cannot
be
reduced
below
110,
and
that
slows
that
would
reduce
below
220
are
modified.
To
put
it
another
way:
a
reduction
of
99%
will
not
reduce
you
to
3
movement
speed,
but
rather
it
will
reduce
you
closer
to
110
than
a
weaker
slow
would.
Without
slow
resist
from
Relentless
or
Boots
of
Swiftness
,
your
movement
speed
will
be
between
110
and
120.
Notes
Thresh's
basic
attack
wind
up
is
reduced
by
0.
25
%
per
1%
attack
speed,
rather
than
the
standard
1%.
