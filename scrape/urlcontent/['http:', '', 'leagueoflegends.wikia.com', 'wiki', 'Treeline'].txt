Lore
The
Field
of
Justice
known
as
the
Twisted
Treeline
is
one
of
the
League
arenas
.
The
arena
is
located
in
the
mysterious
Shadow
Isles.
An
eternally
thick,
unnatural
fog
blankets
the
islands
from
the
view
of
outsiders.
It
is
thought
that
the
islands
are
home
to
countless
forms
of
undead,
though
no
one
seems
eager
to
perform
the
exploration
necessary
to
find
out
the
truth.
The
Tree
lives
The
Twisted
Treeline
located
on
the
Shadow
Isles
The
twisting
magical
energies
unleashed
by
mages
during
the
Rune
Wars
caused
an
incredible
amount
of
devastation
to
the
natural
world.
The
League
was
established
to
control
the
use
of
this
magic
by
confining
it
to
the
Fields
of
Justice.
By
limiting
its
use
to
there,
they
thought
that
they
could
prevent
it
from
doing
further
harm
to
the
environment.
It
seemed
that
they
were
successful
until
Maokai,
the
Twisted
Treant
,
came
into
being.
During
a
League
match,
Maokai,
an
ancient
oak
that
stood
above
the
upper
jungle,
spontaneously
roared
to
life.
Ripped
from
the
natural
balance
by
arcane
forces,
his
sentience
was
forged
in
chaos.
Before
the
Adjudicators
of
the
League
could
step
in
and
suppress
him,
he
slew
all
six
champions
participating
in
the
match.
The
scholars
of
the
Arcanum
Majoris
took
a
keen
interest
in
him,
as
they
were
eager
to
discover
the
secrets
of
his
animation.
The
Arrival
of
Nightmare
Twisted
treeline
art
Summoners
in
the
League
of
Legends
were
afflicted
by
sleep-related
incidents
for
a
long
time,
some
wake
up
screaming,
terrified
and
beyond
consolation.
Some
could
not
fall
asleep,
slowly
going
mad
as
night
ticked
by.
Some
simply
never
woke
up.
Physicians
were
baffled
until
a
Field
Architect
happened
to
pass
out
next
to
a
nexus
on
the
Twisted
Treeline.
With
a
magical
energy
arced
from
the
nexus,
Nocturne
the
Eternal
Nightmare
appeared
and
slaughtered
everything
in
his
sight
before
the
summoners
were
able
to
magically
confine
him.
As
a
punishment
for
all
of
his
crimes,
The
League
allowed
summoners
to
call
upon
Nocturne,
bending
his
will
to
the
summoners
he
hates
and
creating
his
own
personal
nightmare.
Gameplay
Map
of
The
Twisted
Treeline.
The
Twisted
Treeline
is
a
two
lane
map
where
two
teams
consisting
of
three
players
battle
in
fast-paced
action
while
their
ultimate
goal
is
to
destroy
the
enemy
team's
nexus.
Aside
from
its
two,
slightly
curved
lanes,
the
map
also
features
several
neutral
monster
camps
and
two
altars
to
be
captured
as
well
as
a
free
health
pick-up
-
all
situated
in
the
jungle
between
the
lanes
-
giving
plenty
of
opportunities
for
team
fights.
There
is
also
a
path
over
the
top
lane
which
leads
to
Vilemaw's
lair.
The
team
who
defeats
the
horrific
creature
inside
receive
the
Crest
of
Crushing
Wrath
,
which
provides
bonus
health
and
mana
regeneration
as
well
as
an
attack
speed
buff
and
20%
cooldown
reduction
.
Features
Twisted
Treeline
Jungle
Two
lanes
to
fight
your
way
to
the
enemy
base.
A
jungle
populated
by
neutral
monsters
of
varying
degrees
of
toughness.
Powerful
turrets
defend
key
areas
on
the
map.
You
must
confront
these
in
addition
to
your
enemies
if
you
are
to
make
headway
toward
victory.
Two
bases
at
opposite
sides
of
the
map,
populated
by
a
shop,
a
nexus
and
one
turret
to
defend
the
nexus.
A
Ghost
Relic
is
located
in
the
middle
of
the
map
Two
altars
situated
on
both
sides
of
the
lower
jungle.
An
altar
is
sealed
for
90
seconds
after
capturing
it.
New
items
to
complement
its
fast-paced
gameplay,
and
825
base
starting
gold
.
Strategy
Vilemaw
Work
with
your
teammates
to
use
the
close
lanes
as
a
chance
to
kill
enemy
Champions
as
a
team.
The
basic
strategy
is
to
have
2
players
laning
on
the
bottom
and
1
player
laning
on
the
top,
allowing
for
one
stronger
player
to
develop
ahead
of
the
other
2
and
have
a
large
advantage
when
ganking
the
bottom
lane
enemies.
Laning
should
not
continue
for
too
long
though
as
it
is
much
quicker
to
level
and
gain
gold
from
ganking
enemies
once
you
are
strong
enough.
The
more
competitive
strategy
is
to
have
2
players
laning
at
the
top
and
1
laning
at
the
bot.
This
setup
has
better
Vilemaw
(and
jungle
in
general)
control.
If
there
are
2
champions
on
1
lane,
only
one
of
them
should
farm,
a
farmed
champion
+
support
are
more
useful
in
teamfights
than
2
unfarmed
champions.
Another
viable
setup
is
two
solo
lanes
with
a
jungler.
The
jungle
remake
on
Twisted
Treeline
made
mobs
more
tough
and
there
are
not
that
many
viable
junglers
now.
When
champions
that
are
effective
at
jungling
are
played
in
top
lane,
killing
jungle
monsters
to
outlevel
your
opponents
and
get
neutral
monster
buffs
is
a
strategy
that
is
commonly
used.
The
jungle
area
in
Twisted
Treeline
is
good
not
only
to
sneak
on
the
opponent
but
also
to
outsmart
them
by
running
away
or
baiting
them
into
a
bad
position.
AD
carries
are
viable
on
Twisted
Treeline,
but
they
must
be
protected
by
team
like
on
Summoners
Rift.
Roles
of
champions
are
more
or
less
the
same
as
in
5v5,
but
a
setup
with
a
AD
carry
should
have
enough
cc
to
make
him/her
safe.
A
critical
area
is
the
lair
of
Vilemaw
,
located
at
the
top
of
the
map.
It
is
a
high
value
objective,
so
pay
close
attention
to
the
location
of
enemy
champions
so
that
you
are
aware
when
they
attempt
to
take
him
down.
Keep
in
mind
that
the
revised
Twisted
Treeline's
shop
does
not
carry
wards,
so
vigilance
is
your
only
means
of
protecting
the
spider
from
the
other
team.
Although
wards
do
not
exist
in
the
shop,
some
champions
like
Caitlyn
,
Heimerdinger
,
Maokai
,
Nidalee
,
Shaco
,
Teemo
,
and
Zyra
have
abilities
that
can
be
effectively
used
as
wards.

Trivia
After
capturing
one
of
the
two
altars
on
Twisted
Treeline
champions
originating
from
the
Shadow
Isles
,
which
include
Hecarim
,
Mordekaiser
,
Elise
,
Karthus
,
and
Yorick
,
the
summoned
"spirit"
will
say
unique
messages
to
those
particular
champions.
The
messages
are
different
for
west
and
east
altars
,
representing
good
and
evil
respectively.
This,
however,
excludes
Evelynn
,
because
Riot
didn't
want
to
give
too
much
information
about
her
lore,
and
Thresh
,
because
lines
for
him
have
not
been
recorded
yet.
In
addition,
all
Shadow
Isles
champions
can
also
hear
additional
lines
available
to
all
of
them,
including
Evelynn
and
Thresh.
All
the
messages
can
be
seen
here
or
on
the
altar
page.
If
two
champions
dance
in
front
of
Vilemaw
within
5
seconds,
Vilemaw
will
join
in.
The
Twisted
Treeline's
remake
is
heavily
influenced
by
Elise's
concept
and
development.

Marc
Merrill
in
an
interview
with
Zam.com
first
mention
the
map:
So
in
regards
to
the
new
map,
which
is
one
of
the
hottest
items
that
we're
really
excited
about,
we're
about
to
roll
one
out.
It's
going
to
be
going
into
the
beta
shortly.
I
don't
know
if
it's
in
this
release
or
if
it's
in
the
release
at
the
end
of
the
month.
It's
coming
out
really
soon,
it's
a
two
lane
map,
it's
awesome,
there's
a
lot
of
action,
it's
really
well
designed
to
force
action
to
the
middle
of
the
map,
and
it's
designed
for
a
3
on
3
play
experience.
So
it's
very
different
experience,
it
will
be
a
lot
of
fun
for
users
to
go
bang
away
on
that.

The
map
was
first
shown
to
the
public
on
October
19th,
2009
on
