Trivia
Zed's
ultimate
was
changed
before
release
to
create
only
one
shadow.
Forum
post
by
Scarizard
It
originally
created
two
shadows
and
is
still
animated
for
two.
Zed
was
designed
by
CertainlyT
and
Samizul
.
[1]
Zed
is
the
1st
champion
whose
death
animation
shows
him
escaping
(via
a
shadow
portal),
rather
than
actually
dying.
Whether
he
actually
manages
to
cheat
death
remains
open
to
debate.
His
Shockblade
skin
has
a
different
animation.
Instead
of
crawling
into
a
shadow
portal,
a
bolt
of
lightning
strikes
him
and
he
disappears
.
Zed
is
the
5th
champion
to
utilize
energy
as
a
resource.
Zed
is
one
of
the
8
champions
who
do
not
have
a
single
skill
that
scales
off
ability
power,
along
with
Darius
,
Draven
,
Garen
,
Olaf
,
Riven
,
Talon
,
and
Vayne
.
Zed
switches
his
running
animation
into
Airplane
Arms
,
seen
here
when
moving
at
a
high
movement
speed
(such
as
using
Ghost
)
The
Airplane
Arms
animation
is
also
activated
when
Zed
is
affected
by
an
ally's
Captain-enchanted
boots,
suggesting
that
any
temporary
speed
buff
will
change
his
running
animation.
Zed
is
the
third
dark-themed
Ionian
Champion
along
with
Syndra
and
Varus
.
Zed's
abilities
have
elements
that
mirror
those
of
the
Kinkou's.
Zed's
Razor
Shuriken
mirrors
Kennen's
Thundering
Shuriken,
his
Living
Shadow
mirrors
Shen's
Shadow
Dash
and
his
Shadow
Slash
mirrors
Akali's
Crescent
Slash.
Zed's
ultimate
Death
Mark
also
"marks"
a
target,
which
deals
additional
effects
upon
detonation.
This
is
similar
to
Shen's
Vorpal
Blades,
Kennen's
Mark
of
the
Storm
and
Akali's
Mark
of
the
Assassin.
Quotes
Zed's
joke
is
a
reference
to
the
Mortal
Kombat
franchise.
Zed
shares
a
quote
with
Shen
:
"Without
a
sound."
Zed
has
a
special
taunt
when
facing
Shen
"Challenge
me
Shen....'
You
shall
not
be
an
orphan
long!"
Design
&
Concept
Zed
bears
some
resemblance
to
the
Shredder
from
the
Teenage
Mutant
Ninja
Turtles
franchise,
namely
Shredder's
later
designs
where
his
face
cannot
be
seen
and
his
facemask
is
a
grill-like
kenpo.
Zed
also
serves
as
an
antagonistic
role
to
a
group
of
ninjas
in
his
backstory.
Zed
has
similar
powers
over
shadows
and
looks
similar
to
Noob
Saibot
from
the
Mortal
Kombat
series.
Zed
also
bears
some
resemblance
to
Lord
Zedd
from
the
Power
Rangers
franchise,
mainly
due
to
the
name
and
similarities
in
the
mask.
Zed's
Shockblade
skin
bears
some
resemblance
to
Storm
Shadow
from
the
G.I.
Joe
franchise.
Zed's
dance
is
inspired
by
various
martial
arts.
The
animator
that
formed
the
idea
is
a
black
belt.
[1]
Zed's
name
is
similar
to
the
name
of
the
antagonist
organization
from
the
classic
Genesis
Shinobi
series,
where
the
organization
is
known
as
"Zeed"
and
later
"Neo
Zeed".
Furthermore,
in
the
game
"Revenge
of
Shinobi",
Neo
Zeed
kills
the
protagonist's
master.
Additionally
the
final
boss
of
Shinobi
3
is
called
the
Shadow
Master
,
and
has
a
very
similar
design
to
Zed.
Relations
Zed
and
Shen
were
taught
under
the
same
master,
Shen's
father,
and
were
rivals
to
one
another.
However,
before
Zed's
fall,
Shen
respected
him
as
a
strong
fellow
student
and
was
even
a
bit
jealous
of
him
as
Shen's
father
was
less
strict
towards
him.
[2]
Zed
would
later
murder
Shen's
father
and
establish
a
new
ninja
order,
the
Order
of
the
Shadow.
Zed
seeks
to
abolish
the
old
ways
of
balance
and
replace
them
with
the
forbidden
art
of
the
shadow.
Any
ninja
who
refuses
to
learn
will
be
eliminated.
According
to
Runaan,
Akali
may
have
some
former
connection
to
Zed.
What
that
connection
was
has
yet
to
be
elaborated
on,
but
it
has
something
to
do
with
her
title,
"the
Fist
of
Shadow
",
and
her
passive,
"Twin
Disciples".
[3]
In
a
later
post,
he
mentions
that
Zed
once
has
a
"favourite
student"
who
has
since
left
the
Order
of
Shadows,
[4]
and
that
Zed
thinks
her
talents
are
wasted
with
the
Kinkou
.
Zed
sees
Kennen
as
a
disgrace.
Syndra
may
consider
allying
with
Zed.
Karma
recognizes
Zed
as
a
dangerous
force
of
chaos
that
must
be
stopped.
Future
interactions
between
Zed
and
Nocturne
have
been
hinted
at.
[5]
The
most
common
speculation
comes
from
the
entire
community,
saying
Zed
is
Nocturne.
A
full
explanation
is
listed
here.
https://m.youtube.com/#/watch?v=NcW94x-lvPU
Akali
wants
him
dead,
Shen
thinks
there
might
be
another
way,
and
Kennen
believes
he
is
not
beyond
redemption.
