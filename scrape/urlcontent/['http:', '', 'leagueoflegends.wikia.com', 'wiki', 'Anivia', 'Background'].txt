An
eternal
guardian,
the
Cryophoenix
has
held
a
solitary
vigil
over
the
Freljord
for
a
thousand
lifetimes.
Sensing
a
growing
corruption
of
the
land
itself,
Anivia
joins
the
Avarosan
in
the
belief
that
a
united
Freljord
can
defeat
the
coming
darkness.
Anivia
is
a
being
of
the
coldest
winter,
a
mystical
embodiment
of
ice
magic,
and
an
ancient
protector
of
the
Freljord.
She
commands
all
the
power
and
fury
of
the
land
itself,
calling
the
snow
and
bitter
wind
to
defend
her
home
from
those
who
would
harm
it.
A
benevolent
but
mysterious
creature,
Anivia
is
eternally
bound
to
keep
vigil
over
the
Freljord
through
life,
death,
and
rebirth.
Anivia
is
as
much
a
part
of
the
Freljord
as
the
never-ending
frost.
Long
before
mortals
had
ever
set
foot
on
the
land's
frigid
tundra,
she
had
lived
countless
lifetimes
and
died
as
many
deaths.
The
beginnings
and
ends
of
her
eternal
cycle
always
heralded
great
change,
from
the
calming
of
raging
storms
to
the
ebb
and
flow
of
ice
ages.
It
is
said
that
when
the
cryophoenix
dies,
an
era
ends;
and
when
she
is
reborn,
a
new
era
begins.
Though
Anivia's
past
lifetimes
have
faded
from
her
memory,
she
knows
her
purpose:
she
must
protect
the
Freljord
at
all
costs.
When
she
was
last
reborn,
Anivia
witnessed
the
rise
of
a
mighty
and
united
human
tribe.
She
guarded
their
lands
with
pride
as
they
prospered,
but
such
unity
could
not
last
forever.
The
great
tribe
fractured
into
three,
and
after
that
upheaval,
Anivia
watched
the
people
of
the
Freljord
become
embroiled
in
battle.
As
she
strove
to
calm
the
turmoil
tearing
her
home
apart,
Anivia
began
to
sense
a
greater
threat:
an
ancient
evil
growing
deep
within
the
earth.
To
her
horror,
she
felt
the
pure
magic
of
the
ice
itself
become
blackened
and
corrupt.
Like
blood
in
water,
darkness
crept
into
the
Freljord.
With
her
destiny
so
tied
to
the
power
of
the
land,
Anivia
knew
if
such
evil
took
root
in
her
home,
that
same
darkness
would
find
its
way
into
her
heart.
She
could
no
longer
remain
a
mere
guardian
-
the
cryophoenix
had
to
act.
Anivia
soon
discovered
an
ally
in
Ashe,
the
Frost
Archer
.
Ashe
too
believed
in
unification
as
an
end
to
the
Freljord's
perpetual
strife,
and
Anivia
offered
the
tribal
leader
her
aid.
Now,
with
war
on
the
horizon,
Anivia
prepares
to
fight
for
peace,
but
she
knows
the
inevitable
truth
of
her
destiny.
One
day,
evil
will
rise
from
the
ice,
and
she
must
destroy
it
-
no
matter
the
cost.
"I
am
the
fury
of
the
blizzard,
the
bite
of
the
wind,
and
the
cold
of
the
ice.
I
am
the
Freljord."
―
Anivia
In
most
lore,
the
phoenix
is
a
creature
of
fire
that
rises
from
its
own
ashes.
What
few
know,
however,
is
that
phoenixes
are
elemental
beings,
formed
by
the
eternal
essences
of
their
native
world.
Anivia
was
conceived
on
a
world
such
as
this
-
a
being
of
the
coldest
winter,
a
creature
of
pure
elemental
ice.
On
her
world,
Anivia
was
the
protector
of
the
frozen
wastes
and
all
those
with
the
spirit
to
endure
in
such
unforgiving
places.
She
was
consulted
as
a
creature
of
great
wisdom,
one
who
could
not
die
and
who
had
seen
the
world
renewed
several
times.
Somehow,
Anivia
knew
that
the
day
would
come
when
she
would
be
plucked
from
her
home
and
pulled
across
worlds,
and
when
that
day
came,
she
received
the
call
with
grace.
Seeing
the
imbalance
and
injustice
on
Runeterra
,
a
world
lacking
elemental
protectors,
Anivia
took
her
place
at
the
League
of
Legends
.
Since
her
arrival,
the
Cryophoenix
has
chosen
to
live
among
the
highest
peaks
of
the
Northern
Ironspike
Mountains
,
adjacent
to
the
frozen
wastes
of
Freljord
.
She
has
openly
claimed
this
territory
as
her
own
protectorate.
Surprisingly,
Anivia
has
struck
up
a
friendship
with
the
yeti
of
this
region
-
a
friendship
that
grows
deeper
and
deeper
with
each
passing
moon.
She
has
formed
a
close
bond
with
two
League
champions
:
Nunu
(and
Willump)
and
the
nomad
princess
Ashe
.
In
a
move
that
caught
the
League
by
surprise,
the
Cryophoenix
recently
entreated
the
summoners
of
the
Institute
of
War
to
research
a
means
in
bringing
across
others
of
her
elemental
fellows.
As
a
champion,
Anivia
is
revered
with
a
sense
of
awe
by
most,
but
is
not
the
most
popular
as
most
consider
her
unapproachable.
Some
say
the
world
will
end
in
fire,
some
in
ice.
Anivia
awaits
the
inevitable
latter.
