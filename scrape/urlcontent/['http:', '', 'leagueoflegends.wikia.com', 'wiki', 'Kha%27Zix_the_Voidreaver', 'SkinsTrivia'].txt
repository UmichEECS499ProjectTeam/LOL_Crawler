The
Hunt
Is
On
As
part
of
the
event
The
Hunt
Is
On!
,
Rengar
and
Kha'Zix
are
assigned
to
defeat
one
another
in
battle.
The
first
to
score
a
kill
on
the
other
claims
victory
(assists
count).
The
event
begins
randomly
after
Kha'Zix
has
used
all
3
evolution
points,
Rengar
is
in
possession
of
the
Bonetooth
Necklace
with
at
least
10
stacks,
and
all
members
of
both
teams
must
be
alive
for
the
event
to
start.
If
Kha'Zix
is
victorious,
he
gains
a
fourth
evolution
point.
If
Rengar
is
victorious,
his
Bonetooth
Necklace
is
replaced
with
the
Head
of
Kha'Zix
,
which
grants
him
the
bonuses
of
a
fully
stacked
Bonetooth
Necklace
.
This
event
can
only
occur
once
per
game,
even
if
both
teams
possess
both
champions.
A
video
describing
the
event
can
be
found
here
.
Trivia
Kha'Zix
was
designed
by
David
“Volty"
Abecassis
.
Kha'Zix's
placeholder
name
was
Teek.
[1]
Kha'Zix
is
voiced
by
Dameon
Clarke
who
also
voices
Singed
.
Morello
has
stated
Kha'Zix
is
not
in
any
way
related
to
Omen
.
[2]
The
interaction
between
Kha'Zix
and
Rengar
is
a
reference
to
the
Alien
vs
Predator
series.
During
his
Recall
and
Teleport
animation,
Kha'Zix
poses
similarly
to
the
Monster
from
Cloverfield
.
Kha'Zix
movement
animation
changes
when
he
enters
the
brush.
He
puts
his
arm-scythes
to
his
sides
to
make
himself
more
aerodynamic
as
he
runs.
This
same
movement
animation
change
occurs
during
the
stealth
afforded
to
him
by
Void
Assault
.
When
Leap
is
evolved
there
is
chance
he
will
fly
when
moving,
similar
to
Pulsefire
Ezreal
and
Monarch
Kog'Maw
.
Kha'Zix's
Void
Spike
ability
is
similar
to
Hydralisk's
spike
attack
animation
from
Starcraft
2
.
Kha'Zix
has
animations
listed
as
"Stunned"
and
"Knockup",
they
can
be
seen
here
.
Kha'Zix
is
possibly
the
last
champion
to
have
a
Art
Spotlight
Video
since
no
other
new
champions
were
post
after
release.
Interestingly,
evolution
points
can
be
spent
on
abilities
which
Kha'Zix
has
not
learned
yet,
however
this
only
has
any
benefit
with
Taste
Their
Fear
,
adding
range
to
his
attacks.
If
Kha'Zix
has
any
unspent
skill
points
after
leveling
Void
Assault
,
then
he
must
spend
the
evolution
points
before
he
can
spend
his
remaining
skill
points.
Quotes
Kha'Zix
adds
additional
quotes
to
his
in-game
dialogue
based
on
which
abilities
he
evolves.
Kha'Zix
shares
a
quote
with
Skarner
:
"Limb
from
limb."
Skins
Mecha
Kha'Zix
is
the
first
launch
skin
to
be
priced
at
1350
.
The
champion
bundle
was
seemingly
priced
as
if
Mecha
Kha'Zix
cost
975
,
as
bundles
are
priced
with
skins
being
50%
off
their
usual
price.
The
skin
features
a
new
joke
but
disables
his
classic
skin
jokes.
Mecha
Kha'Zix
has
a
mechanical
sound
effect
on
voice.
Special
particles
and
effects
are
added
to
Mecha
Kha'Zix's
skills,
similar
to
the
Battlecast
Cho'Gath
skin.
His
W,
Void
Spike
with
the
Mecha
Kha'Zix
skin,
fires
in
a
similar
fashion
to
a
cluster
grenade
from
the
Metal
Gear
series,
specifically
Metal
Gear
Solid
2
when
the
Metal
Gear
Ray
fires
said
grenades
around
the
area
during
the
Harrier
scene.
Classic
Kha'Zix's
splash
art
shows
him
as
he
had
evolved
Taste
Their
Fear
,
Void
Spike
and
Leap
and
as
if
he
had
not
slain
Rengar
,
else
he
would
had
also
evolved
Void
Assault
.
His
claws
are
also
glowing
suggesting
that
he
has
Unseen
Threat
active.
Classic
Kha'Zix
shares
visual
similarities
with
many
insect-like
creatures
in
fiction,
especially
those
based
off
mantises.
Relations
Kha'Zix
fought
against
Rengar
from
sunset
to
sunrise
and
was
wounded
during
the
conflict.
He
now
seeks
to
consume
Rengar
in
order
to
evolve
into
the
ultimate
predator.
Kha'Zix
and
Rengar's
rivalry
is
possibly
a
reference
to
the
Alien
vs
Predator
series.
Kha'Zix,
Cho'Gath
,
Kog'Maw
and
Vel'Koz
originate
from
the
Void
.
