Ability
Details
Hyper-Kinetic
Position
Reverser
is
a
single
targeted
blink
with
a
buff
and
debuff
component.
Does
not
apply
spell
effects
.
Spell
shields
will
block
the
initial
suppression,
but
will
not
prevent
the
blink
and
slow
should
Urgot
complete
the
channel
anyway.
Additional
Information:
Crowd
control
immunity
such
as
Black
Shield
or
Ragnarok
will
prevent
the
suppression
effect,
but
if
the
channel
completes
the
target
will
still
be
moved.
Gangplank's
Remove
Scurvy
is
similarly
affected
and
will
still
be
moved
by
the
ability
even
if
he
cleanses
the
suppression.
Unlike
Remove
Scurvy
,
however,
the
active
effects
of
Quicksilver
Sash
and
Mercurial
Scimitar
will
remove
both
the
suppression
and
the
impending
displacement
and
slow.
Urgot
will
still
receive
the
full
bonus
to
himself,
however.
If
Urgot
is
immobilized
somehow
when
the
channel
completes,
neither
Urgot
nor
his
target
will
be
moved.
Hyper-Kinetic
Position
Reverser
cannot
be
voluntarily
cancelled
by
Urgot
mid-cast.
