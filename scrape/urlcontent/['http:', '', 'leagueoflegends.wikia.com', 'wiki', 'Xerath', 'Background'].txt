In
the
ancient
civilization
of
Shurima
,
the
mage
called
Xerath
practiced
magic
with
undying
passion.
He
believed
that
with
enough
magical
power,
he
could
gaze
into
the
heart
of
Runeterra
to
know
the
secrets
of
history
and
the
universe
beyond.
Such
magic
was
beyond
the
limitations
of
a
mortal
body,
but
Xerath
obsessively
pursued
a
path
to
infinite
power
nonetheless.
With
every
breakthrough
he
grew
more
and
more
powerful,
yet
not
without
consequence.
Xerath's
increasing
arcane
abilities
wrought
havoc
on
his
physical
form.
Desperate,
he
undertook
a
dangerous
ritual
to
transcend
his
dying
body.
The
outcome
would
be
immortality
or
self-destruction.
Violent
magic
unleashed
during
the
ritual
caused
devastation
throughout
Shurima,
but
when
the
dust
settled,
Xerath
emerged
as
an
ascended
being
of
pure
arcane
energy.
Free
of
flesh
and
bone,
Xerath
held
nearly
infinite
power
at
his
command.
However,
in
the
wake
of
his
chaotic
ritual,
the
mages
of
Shurima
feared
his
careless
disregard
for
life
would
bring
ruin
to
the
kingdom.
After
a
terrible
struggle
they
subdued
Xerath,
but
they
could
not
destroy
his
ascended
form.
Instead
they
trapped
him
within
an
enchanted
sarcophagus
and
sealed
him
in
an
underground
tomb.
Eons
passed,
civilizations
rose
and
fell,
and
Xerath's
imprisonment
was
lost
to
memory.
For
centuries,
Xerath's
vast
power
tore
away
at
the
sarcophagus
and
weakened
its
spell.
Finally,
he
willed
forth
a
burst
of
magic
that
shattered
his
prison,
but
its
core
remained,
containing
Xerath
and
his
power
within
its
broken
pieces.
Seeking
to
rid
himself
of
this
burden,
he
was
drawn
to
the
magic
of
Valoran's
nexuses
and
found
he
could
absorb
their
power.
Yet
the
nexuses
had
gatekeepers:
petty
mages
known
as
summoners
.
Xerath
knew
his
key
to
true
freedom
from
his
prison
lay
in
gaining
their
trust,
and
he
offered
his
power
to
the
League
of
Legends
.
“I
have
no
need
for
vengeance.
Time
has
brought
ruin
to
the
mages
of
Shurima
and
I
alone
remain.”

Xerath,
the

Ascendant

OBSERVATION
Aside
from
the
vaguely
human
shape
within
the
shattered
remnants
of
his
sarcophagus,
there
is
very
little
indication
that
the
being
called
Xerath
was
ever
a
man.
His
presence
is
cold
and
unfeeling,
with
nothing
to
be
read
upon
the
iron
mask
one
might
call
his
face.
He
does
not
pause
to
observe
the
hallway
around
him.
Xerath
approaches
the
massive
doors
to
the
Reflection
Chamber
and,
with
a
sweep
of
his
arm,
they
open
before
him.
REFLECTION
The
doors
had
only
just
closed
behind
Xerath
when
a
sandstorm
obscured
his
vision.
Violent,
stinging
wind
surrounded
him,
and
he
realized
in
horror
that
it
began
to
eat
away
at
his
very
form.
The
shattered
pieces
of
his
sarcophagus
withered
into
wisps
of
sand.
Worse
still,
Xerath
felt
himself
grow
weak.
As
his
prison
disappeared
into
the
storm,
the
arcane
energy
that
made
up
his
form
faded
with
it,
replaced
by
flesh
and
bone.
The
sands
of
time
had
turned
against
him.
He
was
human
again.
Around
him,
the
storm
took
shape
in
the
darkness.
He
recognized
the
sandstone
walls
and
the
statues
that
rose
from
the
floor
to
the
ceiling.
These
regal
figures
clasped
scepters
to
their
chests,
and
their
eyes,
plated
in
gold,
gazed
eternally
down
upon
those
below
them.
He
was
in
the
Temple
of
the
Falcon,
where
all
the
mages
of
Shurima
practiced
their
craft.
The
peers
of
Xerath’s
youth
sparred
beneath
their
Magi
ancestors.
They
threw
fire
and
ice
and
twisted
magic
into
the
shapes
of
blades,
honing
the
arcane
into
weaponry.
Such
was
the
charge
of
mages:
the
greatest
masters
of
magic
would
stand
victorious
over
Shurima’s
conquered
foes.
Xerath
watched
silently
at
the
temple's
wall,
entranced
by
the
light
from
their
spells.
Nothing
whetted
his
thirst
for
understanding
as
the
pure
arcane.
Its
dull
glow
called
to
him,
and
in
its
depths
he
knew
there
lay
a
thousand
secrets.
“Why
do
you
not
join
them,
Xerath?”
The
voice
broke
his
focus.
Tabia,
one
of
his
fellow
mages,
stood
beside
him.
Her
sudden
appearance
and
the
look
of
her
smile
made
him
stumble
with
his
words
for
a
moment.
“Ah...
well…
we
have
our
differences.”
"You
are
a
mage
of
Shurima,"
Tabia
said.
She
moved
closer
to
him.
“We
have
the
same
path.
What
differences
do
you
mean?”
“The
way
they
bend
their
magic,”
he
replied,
turning
his
gaze
back
to
the
other
mages.
“They
make
weapons
of
it,
but
they
don’t
understand.
The
more
you
force
your
control
over
it,
the
more
you
lose
your
true
connection
to
the
arcane.”
"Magic
is
chaotic.
You
know
the
lessons.
Without
a
mage's
guiding
hand,
we
can
only
hope
to
control
what
the
arcane
does
and
does
not
destroy."
"Yes,
but
if
it's
pure
power
we
want..."
Xerath
cupped
his
hand.
In
the
curl
of
his
slender
fingers,
a
blue-violet
flame
sparked
into
existence.
He
knew
he
could
shape
it
as
he
wished,
but
he
simply
let
it
burn.
On
its
own,
with
only
the
slightest
prodding,
the
flame
grew.
Soon
it
burned
fiercely
in
his
hand,
its
raw
power
coursing
through
him
and
warming
his
very
core.
“All
it
needs
is
a
vessel,”
he
said.
He
turned
his
gaze
up
from
the
flame
to
see
Tabia
looking
at
him,
not
his
magic.
She
smiled
again,
and
her
beauty
drew
his
mind
away
from
the
arcane.
Between
them,
the
flame
grew
stronger…
…and
then
reality
blurred
around
him.
The
temple
darkened
and
Tabia’s
face
faded
from
his
view.
For
a
moment
he
remembered
the
summoners'
trick
and
the
Institute
of
War,
but
pain
drew
him
back
into
another
memory.
Sheer,
limitless
power
set
him
aflame
from
the
inside
out.
Deep
within,
at
his
very
core,
he
felt
a
searing
agony
where
the
fire
burned
too
hot,
threatening
to
burn
its
way
to
the
surface,
to
consume
and
destroy
him.
The
arcane
needed
a
vessel…
but
his
frail
human
form
could
only
hold
so
much.
Xerath
grimaced.
“I
will
not
allow
this
mortal
body
to
stop
me."
He
held
out
his
hand.
Arcane
fire
sprung
from
his
fingertips,
crackling
with
power
as
it
formed
runes
that
hung
briefly
in
the
air.
The
burning,
blinding-white
magic
quickly
grew
to
a
tumultuous
wind
around
him.
An
ancestral
statue
shattered,
its
pieces
crashing
to
the
ground
and
shaking
the
foundation
of
the
temple.
It
took
all
of
his
strength
and
will
to
hold
the
spell.
Even
then
it
swelled
and
flared,
threatening
to
break
free.
But
a
voice
rose
above
the
chaos.
“Xerath!
Stop!”
Tabia.
Xerath’s
hold
over
the
ritual
wavered
as
he
turned
towards
her
voice.
She
stood
at
the
foot
of
a
Magi
ancestor,
her
dark
hair
a
stark
frame
to
her
pale,
beautiful
face.
"You
mustn't
do
this,"
she
shouted,
her
eyes
burning
fearlessly.
"It
will
consume
you.
It
is
killing
you
already,
and
you
would
only
let
it
do
its
work
faster!"
"Tabia,"
Xerath
pleaded,
his
voice
hoarse
and
trembling.
"Please,
you
don't
understand…"
The
spiraling
arcane
twisted
and
pulsed
like
a
storm
above
them.
Xerath
felt
it
slip
further
from
his
grasp.
"You
do
not
need
this,"
she
said,
and
there
was
pleading
in
her
voice,
too.
"Stop
it
now,
and
you
can
heal.
You
can
have
life
again.
I
can
help
you,"
she
paused.
"Come
home."
Xerath's
will
faltered.
Perhaps
she
was
right.
He
imagined
himself
at
home,
away
from
the
Magi
and
the
arcane
forever,
and
all
the
pain
it
had
caused
him.
The
way
it
had
eaten
at
him
from
within,
all
gone.
Perhaps...
Tabia
mouthed
something,
but
Xerath
could
not
hear
her.
The
statue
above
her
shuddered
and
began
to
collapse.
"Tabia!
NO!
"
At
the
sound
of
Tabia’s
scream,
the
rest
of
the
statues
and
the
Temple
walls
began
to
crumble
with
the
force
of
Xerath’s
spell.
He'd
lost
control.
At
its
center,
he
covered
his
face
with
his
hands,
shouting
her
name
in
agony.
His
brief
vision
of
home
and
escape
from
the
arcane
had
been
lost
as
soon
as
he’d
found
the
strength
to
reach
for
it.
It
was
too
late
to
stop
the
spell.
It
would
consume
him,
too,
and
he
trembled
in
terror
at
the
prospect.
All
of
his
efforts
for
naught...
everything
he'd
worked
for,
lost.
Unless
he
finished
the
ritual.
He
hesitated.
Part
of
him
wished
to
accept
death,
but
a
greater
part
still
remembered
what
he'd
set
out
to
do—to
become
something
greater.
To
transcend
the
mortal
body
that
held
other
mages
back.
He
had
nothing
left
but
this.
Though
his
whole
body
ached
with
weakness,
Xerath
steeled
himself.
I
will
become
eternal…
or
I
will
die.
He
raised
his
arms
and
the
writhing
mass
of
magic
above
him
again
gained
some
semblance
of
form,
but
still
it
expanded,
destroying
the
remaining
Magi
statues
and
the
temple's
walls.
Xerath
pulled
the
spell
inward
with
all
the
strength
he
could
muster,
blocking
out
what
he
could
see
of
the
temple
collapsing
around
him.
For
a
moment,
in
the
chaos
of
the
arcane,
he
could
see
a
reflection
of
himself:
a
pale,
emaciated
man,
aged
well
beyond
his
years.
As
the
spell
engulfed
him,
Xerath's
eyes
were
full
of
fear.
In
an
instant,
the
chaos
subsided.
Xerath
was
back
in
the
Reflection
Chamber,
and
a
hooded
summoner
stood
before
him.
"All
that
power,"
said
the
summoner,
"And
now
you
are
a
prisoner."
"An
inconvenience,"
Xerath
replied,
his
voice
echoing
through
the
chamber.
"Yet
not
what
you
envisioned
when
you
took
control
of
that
spell.
Do
you
have
regret,
Magus?"
"I
do
not."
The
summoner
scowled.
"You
sacrificed
yourself,
your
people,
and
the
woman
you
loved...
all
for
power.
Power
you
can
no
longer
reach."
"As
I
said,"
Xerath
continued.
"An
inconvenience.
I
will
be
free."
"Why
do
you
want
to
join
the
League,
Xerath?"
At
this,
Xerath
paused.
"The
burden
of
my
prison
was
brought
about
because
the
mages
of
Shurima
could
not
comprehend
what
it
was
I
pursued.
I
will
not
allow
my
goals
to
be
misunderstood
again.
Consider
my
work
with
your
League,
summoner,
a
show
of
good
faith."
The
summoner
regarded
him
quietly
for
a
moment
before
giving
a
curt
nod.
"As
you
say.
How
does
it
feel,
exposing
your
mind?"
Xerath
turned
away.
“I
am
no
longer
the
naïve
student
you
have
exposed,"
he
said,
"My
previous
existence
means
nothing."

range
barrages
and
sieging.
The
cornerstone
of
this
is
in
his
ability
Locus
of
Power.
This
makes
Xerath
immobile,
but
gives
his
spells
massively
increased
range
and
defense
penetration.
This
really
allows
him
to
set
up
and
barrage
an
area
before
becoming
mobile
again
to
perform
a
more
standard
mage
role.
Using
this
range
gameplay,
Xerath
has
wide-area
spells
he
can
use
to
really
saturate
an
area
with
major
damage.
Arcanopulse,
his
bread-and-butter
ability,
shoots
a
short-delay
beam
at
the
area,
zapping
anyone
hit
for
significant
damage.
Arcane
Barrage,
his
ultimate,
allows
him
to
launch
up
to
three
massive
explosions
at
a
long
range,
both
doing
area
denial
and
good
team
damage.
To
protect
himself,
Mage
Chains
is
a
reliable
single-target
spell
that
will
allow
Xerath
to
stun
an
enemy
if
he
hits
him
with
a
subsequent
spell.
Xerath
is
something
we
liken
to
a
Howitzer
or
artillery
piece.
He
should
really
appeal
to
people
who
enjoy
very
long
ranges
and
like
aiming
skillshots
and
leading
targets.
We’re
excited
to
offer
a
new
mage
paradigm
to
League
of
Legends,
and
will
be
continuing
to
add
new
ways
to
play
existing
roles
into
the
game.
