Speed
Shrine
?
A
speed
shrine
is
an
area
that
grants
a
30%
movement
speed
buff
when
walked
on.
The
movement
speed
bonus
decreases
rapidly
over
its
duration.
There
are
three
speed
shrines
located
on
Crystal
Scar
and
there
used
to
be
one
located
in
the
middle
of
the
Twisted
Treeline
Speed
shrines
are
only
found
on
these
two
maps.
The
location
of
the
shrine
on
the
Crystal
Scar
was
carefully
selected
to
ensure
that
its
use
could
equalize
travel
time
between
any
two
capture
points,
whether
you
were
moving
from
the
Boneyard
in
the
bottom
left
to
the
Refinery
in
the
upper
right,
or
just
across
to
an
adjacent
point.
Speed
shrines
allow
players
to
have
significantly
more
strategic
options
whether
they
are
confronted
with
a
stalemate,
or
are
simply
looking
to
keep
an
opponent
on
their
toes
by
launching
a
timed
attack
at
a
cross-map
objective.
