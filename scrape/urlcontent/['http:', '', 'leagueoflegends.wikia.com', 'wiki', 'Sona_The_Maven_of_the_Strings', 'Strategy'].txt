Skill
usage
Power
Chord
has
three
distinct
effects
based
on
Sona's
currently
active
aura.
Power
Chord
-
Staccato
will
deal
double
the
damage
of
Power
Chords
base
damage.
Charging
Power
Chord
three
times
with
Hymn
of
Valor
at
the
start
of
the
game
can
lead
to
an
advantage
fighting
in
the
brush
at
level
1.
(Use
Hymn
of
Valor
between
the
first
two
auto
attacks)
Power
Chord
-
Staccato
makes
Sona
a
good
early
game
harasser
.
Power
Chord
-
Diminuendo
will
apply
a
20%
damage
reduction
debuff
upon
a
target.
In
a
battle
using
Aria
of
Perseverance
along
with
Power
Chord
to
hit
the
enemy's
carry
can
help
turn
the
tides
of
the
fight.
Aria
of
Perseverance's
Power
Chord
also
affects
Dragon
.
Power
Chord
-
Tempo
will
apply
a
40%
slow
for
2
seconds.
Do
not
underestimate
the
movement
speed
buff
of
Song
of
Celerity
.
The
passive
aura
combined
with
its
AoE
active
can
give
a
very
large
speed
boost
to
Sona's
team.
This
combined
with
its
slow
from
Song
of
Celerity's
Power
Chord
can
make
it
very
difficult
to
catch/run
away
from
her
and
her
team.
â€‹
Sona's
Hymn
of
Valor
is
very
strong
if
leveled
up
quickly.
However,
because
of
her
lack
of
escape
mechanisms
or
survivability
skills,
she
should
still
be
played
as
a
support
champion.
Leveling
first
is
great
for
aggressive
bot
lanes
due
to
Hymn
of
Valor's
passive
aura
granting
additional
AD
and
AP
as
well
as
providing
decent
harass
during
the
laning
phase.
In
a
passive
support
lane,
encourage
your
carry
to
trade
blows
with
the
opponent,
and
do
the
same
with
Hymn
of
Valor
and
Power
Chord
.
Afterwards,
heal
yourself
and
your
partner
with
Aria
of
Perseverance
.
This
will
wear
down
the
enemy
and
force
them
out
of
lane
in
less
time
and
mana
than
just
poking
with
Hymn
of
Valor
.
Use
Aria
of
Perseverance
when
an
ally
is
being
focused
in
order
to
take
advantage
of
the
bonus
armor
and
magic
resistance
.
Aria
of
Perseverance's
passive
aura
is
great
for
a
more
defensive
lane
and
also
for
team
fights
when
paired
with
Aegis
of
the
Legion
Stay
with
the
team.
Sona
makes
an
excellent
healer
,
Crescendo
is
best
used
when
the
whole
team
can
take
advantage
of
it,
and
Song
of
Celerity
lets
the
entire
team
kite.
Without
a
teammate
around,
Sona
is
little
more
than
an
easy
gank.
Early
game,
be
wary
of
constant
spell
rotation,
as
it
will
quickly
drain
her
mana.
However,
this
can
also
be
a
large
problem
mid
to
late
game
without
proper
itemization.
Crescendo
coupled
with
allies'
channeled
abilities
can
devastate
the
opposing
team,
as
while
stunned,
they
can't
interrupt
the
channel.
Build
usage
Being
a
support,
Sona
should
focus
on
supporting
her
AD
carry
early
game
by
warding
and
keeping
him/her
safe.
If
your
carry
can
get
last
hits,
you'll
want
to
leave
them
for
him/her.
You
can
offset
your
lack
of
farm
by
buying
Ancient
Coin
or
Spellthief's
Edge
for
more
sustain,
better
healing,
and
Gp10.
If
you
go
Sona
midlane,
you
usualy
need
to
keep
your
wards
up,
as
chance
to
escape
ganks,
when
not
warded,
is
limited,
and
basicaly
impossible
if
your
flash
is
down.
Getting
fast
Sheen
is
recomended,
as
well
as
getting
Chalice
of
Harmony
right
afterwards.
You
also
want
to
rotate
your
abilities,
in
order
to
have
2
stacks
of
your
passive
always
ready
to
punish
any
overextending
champion
with
Hymn
of
Valor
+
Sheen
+
Power
Chord
.
A
valuable
build
for
Sona
is
stacking
auras,
as
all
it
takes
is
Sona's
presence
for
her
to
be
useful
and
most
of
the
aura
items
you
should
be
getting
are
relatively
cheap.
The
combination
of
lvl
5
Hymn
of
Valor
and
Zeke's
Herald
gives
up
to
40
AD
and
10%
life
steal
to
her
close
allies.
The
combination
of
lvl
5
Aria
of
Perseverance
and
Aegis
of
the
Legion
gives
a
total
of
10
armor
and
30
MR
to
her
close
allies,
or
20
armor
and
40
MR
to
both
allies
while
Active.
Another
defensive
Aura
is
Frozen
Heart
.
Its
debuff
over
enemies
decreases
DPS
damage
output
of
enemy
team,
specially
from
enemy
AD
Carry.
It
can
be
used
in
combination
with
Power
Chord
-
Diminuendo
and
Exhaust
.
Other
offensive
Aura
is
Abyssal
Scepter
.
Its
debuff
over
enemies
increases
the
magic
damage
output
of
your
whole
team.
With
her
Song
of
Celerity
and
a
Talisman
of
Ascension
,
Sona
can
make
it
nearly
impossible
for
the
enemy
to
catch
a
dying
teammate
or
escape
from
her
team
during
a
chase.
These
two
things
also
allow
her
team
to
traverse
great
distances
very
quickly,
such
as
quickly
running
to
a
tower/inhibitor
after
an
ace
to
take
it
down
before
the
enemy
team
revives
or
moving
to
a
friendly
tower/inhib
to
prevent
it
from
being
taken.
All
of
Sona's
skills
(including
her
passive)
scale
with
AP
,
but
support
Sona
should
prioritize
cooldowns
over
AP
.
So
to
maximize
the
utility
of
her
skills,
passive
and
AoE
stun
of
Crescendo
Ionian
Boots
of
Lucidity
,
Fiendish
Codex
,
Athene's
Unholy
Grail
,
Banner
of
Command
,
Morellonomicon
,
Kindlegem
,
Zeke's
Herald
,
Locket
of
the
Iron
Solari
,
Frozen
Heart
and
Talisman
of
Ascension
are
good
options.
With
40%
cooldown
reduction
,
the
cooldown
of
Hymn
of
Valor
,
Aria
of
Perseverance
and
Song
of
Celerity
are
4,2
sec.
and
lvl
3
Crescendo
cooldown
is
60
sec.
As
midlaner,
on
the
other
hand,
AP
items
with
side
utility
should
be
prioritized,
while
getting
CDR
as
close
to
40%
as
possible.
Athene's
Unholy
Grail
is
a
must,
while
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
and
Liandry's
Torment
are
good
to
have
items
to
make
you
both
slightly
more
durable,
and
increase
power
of
your
poke.
Lich
Bane
,
another
useful
item,
is
however
ignored
by
some
in
order
to
achieve
higher
AP
and
therefore
stronger
teamfight
impact,
sacrifying
personal
power
for
stronger
supportive
power.
Sona
is
extremely
valuable
in
group
pushes,
but
sustained
aura
rotation
can
deplete
her
mana
pool
quickly
if
not
equipped
properly,
consider
mana
regeneration
glyphs
per
level
to
make
sure
she
never
runs
out
of
mana.
Because
Sona
has
generally
low
cooldowns
,
low
mana
costs,
and
needs
to
constantly
switch
abilities,
she
charges
up
Seraph's
Embrace
faster
than
almost
any
other
champion.
This
also
helps
her,
as
it
provides
one
of
the
highest
mana
regens
in
the
game,
allows
her
to
stay
in
long
team
pushes
for
much
longer,
and
gives
her
a
small
shield
for
incoming
burst.
Mejai's
Soulstealer
,
while
not
always
viable,
generally
charges
up
quickly
as
long
as
you
stay
safe.
As
long
as
she
has
an
aura
active,
Sona
gets
assists
for
simply
being
at
teamfights.
With
40%
Cooldown
Reduction,
Sona
can
keep
stacks
of
Guinsoo's
Rageblade
up
easily.
Lich
Bane
can
add
a
significant
amount
of
damage
to
her
autoattack.
Combined
with
Power
Chord
it
can
provide
decent
burst
damage.

Sona
is
fairly
squishy
throughout
the
game,
especially
at
level
1.
Work
with
your
allies
to
kill
her
fast.
When
laning
against
Sona
,
be
sure
to
play
safe
as
she
can
boost
her
partner
with
her
supporting
spells.
All
of
Sona
's
active
stances
are
AoE
,
meaning
that
you
can
avoid
her
spells
by
moving
away
from
her.
Do
not
overextend
when
chasing
an
enemy
that
is
accompanied
with
Sona
.
Her
Song
of
Celerity
allows
her
to
outrun
you
very
quickly.
During
teamfights
try
to
kill
Sona
first,
since
she
provides
consistent
damage/defense
boosting
auras
through
the
teamfight,
as
well
as
an
AoE
stun.
