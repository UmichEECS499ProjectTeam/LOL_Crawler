H-28G

Turret
and
H-28Q
Apex

are
ground-target
abilities
that
construct
a
static,

Additional
Information:
Leveling-up

H-28G
Evolution
Turrets
will
not
affect
the
stats
of
any
existing
turret.
A
number
of
small
cogs
can
be
seen
orbiting
Heimerdinger's
model
to
represent
the
number
of
turret
kits
he
has
available.
H-28Q
Apex
Turret
can
be
cast
even
if
Heimerdinger
has
no
turret
kits
in
his
reserve.
The
1
second
cooldown
still
applies,
however,
if
Heimerdinger
has
recently
constructed
a
H-28G
turret.
Please
see
below
for
information
regarding
the
turrets.

Applies

and
Lifeline
.
Spell
shields
can
block
multiple
abilities/components
of
a
single
ability
if
they
would
strike
at
the
same
time,
as
there
is
no
priority
system
in
place
to
say
which
hit
first.
While
on
paper
a
spell
shield
should
only
block
a
single
missile,
in
practice
they
will
block
a
single
wave
of
missiles.
Additional
Information:
Hextech
Micro-Rockets
uses
Quick
Casting
by
default.
The
cast-style
for
Hextech
Micro-Rockets
is
similar
to
Lulu's
Glitterlance
in
the
sense
that
there
are
5
mini
skill-shots
that
start
from
slightly
different
points
and
are
each
aimed
individually
-
allowing
for
V
and
X
shapes.

H-28G
Evolution
Turrets
are
static
minions
that
attack
nearby
enemies.
Classified
as
a
minion
for
targeting
purposes.
The
turret's
basic
attacks
do
not
apply
spell
effects
or
on-hit
effects
.
The
turret's
laser
beam
applies
spell
effects
as
an
area
of
effect
ability.
Spell
vamp
is
reduced
to
one-third
effectiveness.
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
will
apply
a
15%
slow.
Banner
of
Command
will
increase
the
magic
damage
dealt
by
a
turret's
basic
attacks.
Turrets
take
40%
increased
damage
from
champion
melee
autoattacks.
[2]
Turrets
will
prioritize
Heimerdinger's
attack
target
or
enemies
attacking
Heimerdinger
with
its
basic
attack,
and
nearby
enemy
champions
with
its
laser
beam.
Turrets
are
created
with
80%
charge,
meaning
they
can
fire
their
first
beam
after
a
maximum
of
2.
4
seconds
(reduced
if
the
turret
attacks).
The
current
charge
is
displayed
as
a
bar
beneath
the
turret's
health
bar.
The
laser
beam
has
a
short
wind-up
time
and
the
line-of-fire
is
telegraphed
to
both
allies
and
enemies,
similar
to
Zap!
.
A
8-second
timer
appears
beneath
the
turret
while
Heimerdinger
is
out
of
range,
representing
the
time
until
it
goes
offline
(visually
similar
to
Zac's
healing
chunks
).
The
laser
beam
loses
all
current
charge
when
it
goes
offline.
Turrets
will
instantly
come
online
the
moment
Heimerdinger
moves
back
in
range.
Offline
turrets
still
grant
sight,
albeit
over
a
reduced
area
(~200-radius).
