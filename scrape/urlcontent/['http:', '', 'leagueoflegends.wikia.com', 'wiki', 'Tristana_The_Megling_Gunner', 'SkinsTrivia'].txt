Trivia
Tristana
was
designed
by
Ezreal
.
Tristana's
bears
a
strong
resemblance
to
her
likely
inspiration
the
main
character
from
the
Tank
Girl
series.
Tristana's
ability
Rocket
Jump
is
a
refrence
to
Rocket
Jump
in
FPS
Arena
games
like
Quake
which
allowed
you
mobility
by
using
a
RPG
to
go
somewhere.
Tristana's
ability
Buster
Shot
is
a
refrence
to
the
attack
used
by
Megaman.
Tristana
has
the
third
longest
possible
auto
attack
range
in
the
game
at
703
range
at
level
18,
right
after
Kog'Maw
when
he
uses
his
Bio-Arcane
Barrage
,
which
grants
him
an
auto
attack
range
of
710
and
Twitch
when
he
uses
Spray
and
Pray
which
grants
him
an
auto
attack
range
of
850
but
changes
his
attacks
to
skillshots.
You
can
start
to
Recall
during
Tristana's
Rocket
Jump
without
interruption.
Quotes
Her
quote
"Is
that
a
rocket
in
your
pocket?"
is
a
variant
of
Mae
West's
famed
quote.
Skins
The
Riot
Girl
Tristana
skin
is
free
and
obtainable
by
visiting
this
page
and
then
syncing
with
the
appropriate
LoL
website.
If
you
do
not
own
the
champion,
Tristana
will
also
be
given
to
you,
free.
Guerilla
Tristana
bears
a
strong
resemblance
to
the
fictional
movie
character
John
Rambo
.
Buccaneer
Tristana
shares
a
pirate
theme
with
Fiddle
Me
Timbers
,
Bilgewater
Katarina
,
Bilgerat
Rumble
,
Bilgewater
Swain
and
Pirate
Ryze
.
Tristana
has
an
unreleased
skin
titled,
Arm
Cannon
Tristana
.
It's
game
files
were
added
into
the
Wukong
Patch,
but
it
was
never
made
public.
A
video
showing
this
can
be
found
here
.
Relations
Tristana
and
Teemo
became
close
friends
after
joining
the
League,
though
she
ignores
any
questions
pertaining
to
a
blossoming
romance
with
him.
It
is
suggested
from
the
Journal
of
Justice
that
Rumble
has
a
crush
on
Tristana,
and
therefore
named
his
mechanical
robot
"Tristy".
