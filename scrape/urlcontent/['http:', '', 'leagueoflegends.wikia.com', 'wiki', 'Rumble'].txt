Rumble,
the
Mechanized
Menace
is
a
champion
in
League
of
Legends
.
[1]
Abilities
Rumble's
abilities
have
no
cost
related
to
them,
and
the
use
of
his
abilities
is
only
limited
by
cooldowns.
Instead,
he
uses
Heat
as
his
secondary
resource.
Rumble
starts
with
0
Heat,
and
it
caps
at
100.
Rumble's
basic
abilities
generate
20
Heat
when
used.
When
Rumble
reaches
50
Heat,
he
is
in
the
Danger
Zone,
causing
all
of
his
basic
abilities
to
have
enhanced
effects.
When
Rumble
reaches
100
Heat
he
overheats
for
6
seconds;
during
this
time
he
may
not
use
his
own
abilities,
but
all
his
basic
attacks
deal
additional
magic
damage.
While
not
overheated,
after
4
seconds
of
not
using
his
basic
abilities
he
will
start
losing
Heat
at
a
rate
of
10
Heat
per
second,
then
at
a
rate
of
20
Heat
per
second
2.
5
seconds
later.
Junkyard
Titan
When
Rumble
reaches
100
Heat
he
overheats
for
6
seconds.
While
overheated
Rumble
cannot
use
his
own
spells,
but
his
basic
attacks
deal
an
additional
20
+
(5
×
level)
(+
25%
AP)
magic
damage.
Rumble's
Heat
is
reset
to
0
after
the
overheat
effect
ends.
Ability
Details
Junkyard
Titan
is
a
self-
debuff
,
on-hit
effect
ability.
Does
not
apply
spell
effects
.
The
triggering
attacks
will
apply
other
on-hit
effects
and
can
critically
strike
as
normal.
Critical
strikes
do
not
interact
with
the
bonus
damage
of
Junkyard
Titan
.
PENDING
FOR
TEST
Junkyard
Titan's
relationship
with
dodge
,
parry
,
block
and
blind
has
yet
to
be
tested.
The
bonus
damage
does
not
affect
structures.
Magic
damage
will
be
mitigated
by
Black
Shield
and
Lifeline
.
Spell
shields
will
not
block
the
on-hit
effect.
Additional
Information:
Although
it
visually
appears
as
and
is
termed
a
silence,
overheating
does
not
prevent
Rumble
from
using
summoner
spells
or
item
actives,
only
his
own
spells.
The
exception
is
the
second
cast
of
Electro-Harpoon
,
assuming
the
first
cast
overheats
him.
The
duration
of
the
silence
cannot
be
reduced
by
absolutely
any
means.
This
includes
Tenacity
such
as
from
Mercury's
Treads
or
CC
removal
such
as
Quicksilver
.
