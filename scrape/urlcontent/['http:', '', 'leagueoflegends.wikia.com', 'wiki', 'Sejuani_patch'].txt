enemy
champion.
Northern
Winds
:
Sejuani
summons
an
arctic
storm
around

seconds
which
deals
magic
damage
to
nearby
enemies
every
second.
Damage
is
increased
against
enemies
affected
by
Frost
or
Permafrost.
Permafrost
:
Sejuani
converts
Frost
on
nearby
enemies
to
Permafrost,
dealing
magic
damage
in
that
instant
and
increasing
the
movement
speed
reduction
dramatically.
Glacial
Prison

Sejuani
throws
her
weapon
in
a
line
in
front
of
her,
stunning
the
first
enemy
champion
it
hits.
Nearby
enemies
are
stunned
for
a
shorter
duration.
All
targets
take
magic
damage
and
are
affected
by
