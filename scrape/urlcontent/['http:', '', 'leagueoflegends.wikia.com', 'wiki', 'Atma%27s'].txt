The

is

when
the

has

maximum
health
.
Notes
All
champions
have
between
1260-1764
base
health
at
lvl
13,
therefore,
this
item
is
cost
efficient
for
every
champion
in
the
game
by
level
13.
Atma's
Impaler
adds
directly
to
attack
damage
.
It
is
not
an
"on-hit"
effect.
[1]
.
At
3000
health,
the
unique
passive
grants
the
same
amount
of
attack
damage
as
a
B.
F.
Sword
(45).
Atma's
Impaler
's
passive
does
not
include
bonus
health
from
masteries,
despite
having
the
same
tooltip
as
Warmog's
Armor
which
benefits
from
it.
This
is
most
likely
due
to
a
bug.
Strategy
Champions
with
large
health
pools
or
health-gaining
abilities,
like
Sion
and
Cho'Gath
,
profit
greatly
from
Atma's
Impaler
.
Atma's
Impaler
is
one
of
the
most
cost-effective
items
in
game,
surpassing
Pickaxe
on
any
lvl
18
AD
champion
(without
HP
items).
Along
with
being
built
from
a
gold-gen
item
(
Avarice
Blade
),
the
cost-effectiveness
is
increased.
Atma's
Impaler
can
be
combined
with
items
such
as
Frozen
Mallet
and
Warmog's
Armor
to
utilize
both
damage
and
survivability.
These
builds
are
known
in
the
community
as
"Fratma's"
and
"Atmog's",
respectively,
"Fratmog's"
for
both
at
the
same
time.
There
also
exists
an
item
combination
called
"Atrimog's",
the
combo
of
Trinity
Force
,
Atma's
Impaler
and
Warmog's
Armor
Atma's
Impaler
is
one
of
only
a
handful
of
items
beneficial
to
an
attack-based
character
that
provides
armor,
the
only
others
being
Wriggle's
Lantern
,
which
grants
considerably
less
armor
than
the
Impaler;
The
Lightbringer
,
which
along
with
not
being
available
on
SR,
provides
less:
armor,
late-game
AD
and
no
crit
chance;
and
Iceborn
Gauntlet
which
(while
not
giving
any
direct
stat
boost
to
AD)
provides
bonus
damage
on-hit
damage
on
basic
attacks
and
provides
more
armor
at
a
higher
cost.
However,
some
champions
can
use
this
armor
in
synergy
with
AD
magic
resist
items
for
a
balanced
defense,
and
making
use
of
the
Atma's
Impaler's
critical
chance
to
boost
items
like
Infinity
Edge
.
Trivia
The
weapon's
name
is
a
reference
to
the
Ultima
Weapon
(originally
called
"Atma
Weapon")
from
Final
Fantasy
VI
and
subsequent
games,
a
sword
which
deals
damage
according
to
the
hero's
health.
