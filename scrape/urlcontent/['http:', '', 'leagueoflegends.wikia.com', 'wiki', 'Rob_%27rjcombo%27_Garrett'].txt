About
rjcombo
was
an
aspiring
musician
before
going
into
game
development,
and
his
nick
is
partly
derived
from
the
term
"combo
percussion"
(drum
kit).
He's
been
using
it
as
an
internet/gaming
alias
since
the
mid
'90s.
It's
also
derived
from
the
first
two
initials
of
his
name
and
the
character
"T.J.
Combo"
from
the
game
Killer
Instinct
whose
name
he
always
thought
was
cool.

Born
and
raised
in
the
state
of
Maryland,
Rob
“rjcombo”
Garrett
has
been
gaming
for
nearly
three
decades.
Inspired
over
the
years
by
such
titles
as
Star
Raiders,
The
Legend
of
Zelda,
and
EverQuest,
he
embarked
upon
a
career
in
interactive
entertainment
after
completing
a
tour
of
service
in
the
US
Air
Force.
This
journey
began
at
Full
Sail
University,
where
Rob
graduated
from
the
Game
Design
&
Development
program
in
2002.
From
there
he
went
on
to
work
with
teams
at
Big
Huge
Games,
Activision,
and
Red
5
Studios
before
eventually
landing
at
Riot
Games.
A
generalist
designer
with
a
lean
toward
usability
and
moment
to
moment
action,
Rob's
current
focus
is
on
developing
compelling
new
gameplay
experiences
for
current
and
future
players
of
League
of
Legends.
That,
and
actually
completing
a
full
cycle
of
P90X.
Special
Ability
Untauntable
Focus
:
Rob
enters
a
mode
of
extreme
focus,
fully
wrapping
himself
in
a
problem,
and
shielding
himself
from
all
distractions,
taunts,
etc.
