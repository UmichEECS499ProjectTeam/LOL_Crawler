Rob
Blackblade
was
canceled
due
to
not
fitting
within
the
League
of
Legends
artistic
theme.
No
aspect
of
the
champion
was
deemed
worthy
of
keeping,
so
it
was
scrapped.
Rob's
place
in
the
development
cycle
was
filled
by
the
champion
that
became
Udyr
.

Earlier
Concept
Before
the
final
concept
of
Rob
Blackblade
was
done
there
was
an
even
earlier
design
of
him
that
was
also
included
in
the
closed
beta
client's
files.
This
version
of
Rob
lacked
an
eye
patch
and
even
had
a
'black
blade'.
