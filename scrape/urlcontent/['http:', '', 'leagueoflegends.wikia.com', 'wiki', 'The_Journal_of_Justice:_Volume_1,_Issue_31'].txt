Swain
Seizes
Power
in
Noxus
Master
Tactician
named
Grand
General
after
defeating
Keiran
Darkwill
Kaldera
Carnadine
reporting
from
Noxus
Katarina
and
Talon
arrive
in
Noxus
to
witness
Swain's
coronation
as
Grand
General.
Jericho
Swain
defeated
Keiran
Darkwill
in
a
duel
contesting
the
leadership
of
Noxus
last
night,
winning
the
support
of
High
Command.
Despite
rumors
of
involvement
with
the
Institute
of
War's
scandal
in
Kalamanda
,
Swain
has
been
named
Grand
General
–
the
highest
position
in
Noxus.
High
Command
remained
divided
in
support
between
the
two
men
since
Swain
returned
earlier
this
month.
Keiran
Darkwill
challenged
Swain
to
a
duel
to
settle
the
dispute,
claiming
that
such
a
standstill
was
a
"coward’s
game."
Many
members
of
High
Command
believed
this
to
be
a
strong
move
and
expected
Keiran,
a
notoriously
skilled
duelist,
to
win.
Onlookers
reported
that
Keiran
initially
had
the
upper
hand
and
gradually
forced
Swain
into
a
corner.
"He
had
the
Master
Tactician
against
the
wall,"
stated
one
witness.
"I
heard
him
say
'watch
closely,'
and
he
vanished
–
then
reappeared
behind
Keiran.
Swain
dragged
him
to
the
ground
and
locked
the
poor
fool
in
his
snare
spell."
With
Keiran
immobilized,
Swain
called
General
Darius
,
his
most
prominent
supporter,
to
his
side.
"Swain
declared
victory
and
left
Darius
to
‘evaluate
the
strength’
of
Keiran
Darkwill,"
explained
Chancellor
Malek
Hawkmoon.
"That
didn’t
take
Darius
long.
Without
a
word,
he
raised
his
axe
–
and
removed
Darkwill’s
head."
The
gathered
members
of
High
Command
unanimously
agreed
to
swear
loyalty
to
the
Master
Tactician.
With
none
remaining
to
protest
his
claim,
High
Command
named
Jericho
Swain
the
Grand
General
of
Noxus.
"It
was
the
finest
demonstration
of
power
I
have
ever
witnessed,"
stated
Chancellor
Malek
Hawkmoon.
"Swain
rose
to
the
challenge
of
his
opponent,
used
his
wit
and
cunning
to
best
him,
and
demonstrated
his
ability
to
command.
Noxus
under
Jericho
Swain's
rule
shall
be
powerful
indeed."
While
High
Command
has
embraced
his
rule,
Swain’s
leadership
remains
controversial
in
Noxus's
lower
houses.
Some
accuse
Swain
of
willing
participation
in
Heywan
Relivash’s
scheme
to
obtain
Kalamanda.
Katarina,
the
Sinister
Blade
herself,
commented:
"He
gave
Kalamanda
to
the
League
in
exchange
for
power
in
Noxus.
A
bold
move.
A
strong
move.
The
strong
may
rise
to
power
here,
but
this
wouldn’t
be
Noxus
if
there
weren’t
always
others
with
the
strength
to
challenge
them."
Heywan
Relivash
and
Ralston
Farnsley
Arrested
High
Councilor
and
Journal
of
Justice
Senior
Editor
Implicated
in
Conspiracy
Quinton
Groat
reporting
from
the
Institute
of
War.
Authorities
arrested
Heywan
Relivash
earlier
this
week
after
an
investigation
of
his
residence
revealed
his
involvement
in
the
Kalamanda
scandal.
The
uncovered
evidence
also
implicated
Ralston
Farnsley,
the
senior
editor
of
the
Journal
of
Justice
,
as
a
co-conspirator
in
Relivash’s
scheme.
Both
men
were
apprehended
while
seeking
asylum
in
Noxus
and
now
face
trial
at
the
Institute
of
War
.
A
joint
investigation
led
by
Jarvan
IV
and
Katarina
Du
Couteau
traced
the
evidence
found
in
Demacia
to
Relivash.
At
his
residence
investigators
uncovered
a
model
of
the
DSS
Excursion,
and
coded
notes
detailing
its
sabotage,
validating
the
evidence
discovered
in
Demacia
earlier
this
month.
"Relivash
had
been
trying
to
frame
Noxus
all
along,"
commented
Katarina.
"He
put
us
and
Demacia
against
each
other
–
all
so
the
League
could
claim
the
nexuses
in
Kalamanda!"
Among
the
evidence
uncovered
was
a
collection
of
communications
between
Heywan
Relivash
and
an
unnamed
contact,
referred
to
simply
as
'RF.'
Upon
further
investigation,
the
dates
of
these
communications
lined
up
perfectly
to
events
in
Kalamanda.
"The
Journal
of
Justice
was
used
to
pass
secret
and
coded
information
from
Heywan
to
participants
in
the
conspiracy,
and
Ralston
Farnsley
was
his
primary
contact,"
explained
Jarvan
IV.
Authorities
apprehended
Relivash
and
Farnsley
after
Talon
,
acting
independently,
tracked
them
to
the
outskirts
of
Noxus.
They
were
brought
into
custody
before
they
could
seek
asylum
within
Noxus's
walls.
Relivash
and
Farnsley's
network
of
co-conspirators
included
many
authors
of
the
Journal
of
Justice.
Arrests
of
these
contacts
will
continue
over
the
coming
weeks
as
evidence
is
further
reviewed.
Despite
the
arrests
made,
outcry
against
the
Institute
of
War
in
the
streets
of
Demacia
and
Noxus
continues.
In
response
to
the
rising
tension,
High
Councilor
Vessaria
Kolminye
made
this
statement:
"Citizens
of
Valoran
,
the
League
of
Legends
promised
your
protection,
and
in
that
we
have
failed.
Yet
in
the
wake
of
these
events,
we
must
remain
strong.
We
must
not
allow
the
selfish
actions
of
one
man
to
tear
apart
what
we
have
built.
We
cannot
succumb
to
war
when
we
have
committed
ourselves
to
lasting
peace.
Stand
with
us
and
we
shall
rebuild."
Just
Goodbyes
Final
Thoughts
from
the
Journal
of
Justice
Staff
Kaldera
Carnadine
at
the
Institute
of
War
Well,
faithful
readers,
this
is
it:
the
end
of
the
Journal
of
Justice
.
Our
Editor-in-chief
Ralston
Farnsley’s
involvement
in
the
Relivash
scandal
has
removed
us
from
the
Institute’s
good
graces.
So
we’re
being
shut
down.
None
of
us
saw
this
coming
–
well,
most
of
us,
because
I
hear
Henril
Dreving
was
arrested
an
hour
ago.
The
rest
of
our
staff
aren't
frantically
changing
their
names
and
fleeing
to
Piltover
for
a
getaway
blimp
to
Bilgewater
,
so
I'm
hoping
that
we
don't
have
much
more
to
hide.
Since
our
former
editor-in-chief
is
currently
being
held
prisoner
at
the
Institute
of
War,
there
aren’t
exactly
any
rules
to
follow
this
issue.
Many
of
us
wanted
to
thank
you
for
your
continued
support.
So
I
rallied
those
of
us
who
hadn’t
already
packed
up
their
quills
and
headed
home
–
yes,
even
L.B.
Briskes.
He’d
tell
you
it
cost
me
a
bottle
of
Rabble
Rouser
V.S.O.P.
and
a
promise
to
never
bother
him
again,
but
answer
me
this,
summoners:
what’s
one
jaded,
melodramatic,
endlessly
vain
writer
without
an
audience
to
marvel
and
sigh
ponderously
at
his
every
word?
Ram
Steed
showed
up
at
our
office
the
other
day
for
the
first
time
in
months,
ready
to
"spread
the
truth"
and
"tell
the
whole
story."
When
I
told
him
he'd
only
get
one
more
chance
to
do
so,
he
went
red
as
a
rigged
hexplosive
and
started
writing
immediately.
And
of
course
Richor
and
Aria
will
never
hesitate
at
a
chance
at
the
last
word.
That’s
it,
then:
Kaldera
Carnadine,
signing
off.
Thank
you
for
everything,
summoners,
and
farewell!
L.B.
Briskes
at
the
Institute
of
War
"All
good
things
must
come
to
an
end"
appears
to
be
the
mood
of
the
day.
It
began
when
I
found
that
some
indignant
staff
member
had
(in
an
act
of
long-suppressed
resentment)
poured
upon
my
office
floor
the
full
contents
of
my
guest
bar,
my
desktop
aperitif,
my
second
drawer
whiskey
flask,
my
hollowed-runebook
cognac,
my
false
statue
vino
backup
flask,
and
my
trapdoor
moonshine.
Then,
as
I
sat
broodingly
imbibing
the
last
of
my
artificial
plant
vase
bourbon,
I
was
informed
that
the
propagandist
drivel
my
fellow
journalists
have
masqueraded
as
a
reliable
news
source
was,
to
my
surprise,
in
fact
propagandist
drivel.
I
was
then
informed
that
I
would
be
allowed
only
a
few
hours
to
remove
any
cherished
belongings
from
the
office.
I
informed
the
messenger
that
this
would
be
a
pointless
pursuit
without
the
aid
of
a
mop.
So
it
seems
that
my
time
as
the
sunny
relief
of
our
dubious
publication
is
nearing
its
end.
Though
I
have,
in
many
instances,
insisted
that
I
would
rather
administer
exfoliant
to
the
Baron
or
involve
myself
in
an
intellectual
debate
with
“Doctor”
Mundo
than
actually
work
for
my
living,
I
would
like
to
take
this
final
moment
to
reiterate
the
point.
This
is
liberation
at
its
truest.
I’ve
already
engaged
Olivia
to
schedule
a
sampling
tour
of
the
vineyards
of
Northern
Ionia
.
I
have
also
dispatched
a
note
to
a
fellow
author
named
Lain,
who
writes
what
I
can
only
describe
as
distilled
leachate
for
a
competing
rag.
He
details
how
I
will
be
basking
on
coastlines
around
Valoran
unfettered
by
deadlines,
or
word
counts,
or
moral
restraints
while
he
struggles
to
form
cogent
written
thoughts.
I
think
I
may
keep
a
new
journal
of
sorts
outlining
my
exploits
with
only
the
modicum
of
poetic
license
that
I
regularly
reserve
for
myself,
just
to
harrow
him.
Anyhow,
Olivia
is
currently
regarding
me
with
an
expression
that
might
be
characterized
as
"caustically
contemptuous"
and
my
vase
has
dripped
its
final
drop.
Farewell
my
helplessly
adoring
masses,
you
will
be
missed...
by
my
now
unemployable
colleagues.
I,
on
the
other
hand,
am
merrily
off
to
retrieve
my
emergency
tree
trunk
liqueur!
Richor
Ebony
reporting
from
Noxus
Our
duty
here
has
come
to
an
end,
Summoners!
The
League
has
spoken,
and
the
voice
of
the
people
falls
silent.
The
perfidy
of
Ralston
Farnsley
and
his
cohorts
has
placed
a
black
mark
upon
this
office,
and
so,
leaderless,
those
that
remain
shall
retire
to
our
respective
principalities.
For
all
you
true
sons
of
Noxus
,
consider
this
your
rallying
call.
The
League
of
Legends
has
shown
that
even
their
halls
are
not
impenetrable
to
anarchists
and
conspirators.
Only
one
bastion
remains
for
the
ranks
of
the
faithful.
The
banner
men
are
gathering
in
the
halls
of
your
homeland.
Embrace
this
new
era
under
the
watchful
eyes
of
the
raven!
Forever
strong!
Aria
Breker
reporting
from
Demacia
Citizens
of
Demacia
:
dangerous
times
lie
ahead.
I
will
not
waste
what
small
space
I
have
here
on
frivolous
words.
The
situation
is
dire:
despite
the
faith
we've
placed
in
its
leaders,
the
Institute
of
War
has
proven
itself
a
duplicitous
and
unjust
ally.
Swain,
the
Master
Tactician
,
has
risen
to
power
in
Noxus
,
uniting
the
High
Command
beneath
what
any
true
Demacian
knows
to
be
his
tyranny.
In
these
grave
times,
Demacia
must
stand
alone.
We
can
rely
on
nothing
but
our
own
ideals,
our
own
convictions.
We
must
stand
against
the
conniving
greed
of
the
Institute
of
War
and
the
endless
bloodlust
of
the
Noxian
war
machine.
Our
light,
just
and
true,
must
drive
back
the
darkness.
Stand
proud,
citizens,
and
strike
at
the
heart
of
injustice
itself.
Demacia:
now
and
forever.
Ram
Steed
at
the
Institute
of
War
Greetings
friends,
Runeterrans
,
countrymen!
It
is
I,
Ram
Steed,
and
I
have
returned.
Let
me
assure
you
that
the
rumors
about
me
have
been
true
–
I
have
been
silenced!
Until
now!
Kaldera
has
given
me
leave
to
once
again
take
up
the
quill
in
service
of
the
Journal
of
Justice
and
this
reporter
is
unafraid
to
kick
the
steaming
piles
of
offal
they
called
management
and
yell,
"Finally!
You
couldn't
have
fallen
soon
enough!
Too
bad
you
had
to
destroy
this
bastion
of
journalism
on
your
way
down,
you
snakes!"
Oh,
all
those
months
ago.
I
was
barely
recovered
from
being
made
Shaco's
pin
cushion,
fired
up
and
ready
for
action.
And
where
was
that
action?
Kalamanda
.
This
reporter
used
his
keen
intellect
and
relentless
investigation
skills
to
dive
straight
to
the
heart
of
the
matter
–
and
I
found
it.
Before
I
could
bring
this
world-shaking
news
to
light,
High
Councilor
Heywan
Relivash
and
his
conspiratorial
goons
got
me
and
laid
the
blackest
of
blackmails
to
keep
me
silent.
No
longer!
Good
riddance,
Ralston
Farnsley!
Even
if
you
weren't
a
blackguard,
you
wouldn't
know
real
journalism
if
it
bit
off
your
leg!
Rot
in
your
dungeon,
Heywan
Relivash!
Thank
you
for
finally
revealing
the
disease
that
festers
in
the
heart
of
the
League
!
And
to
the
rest
of
you
who've
participated
in
duping
the
citizens
of
Valoran
,
I
raise
high
the
famous
Ram
Steed
one-finger
salute!
Let
justice
be
served!
Keep
the
faith,
seekers
of
the
truth!
This
reporter
is
once
again
unleashed
upon
the
world!
