Zilean
in
the
border
between
Urtistan
and
Shurima
Urtistan
was
once
a
large
city
located
behind
the
Great
Barrier,
south
of
Demacia
,
and
west
of
the
Shurima
Desert

Lore
There
are
few
dwellers,
let
alone
champions,
residing
in
the
blasted
and
dangerous
lands
that
lie
south
of
the
Great
Barrier.
Much
of
that
world
still
bears
the
scars
of
past
Rune
Wars.
Nothing
shows
this
better
than
the
ruins
of
Urtistan.
Once
a
great
and
prosperous
utopia,
now
reduced
to
nothing
but
stone
and
dirt,
and
the
Clock
Tower
where
Zilean
used
to
take
residence.
Zilean,
the
Chronokeeper
The
Chronokeeper
Being
obsessed
with
time,
it
was
only
fitting
that
he
dwelled
in
the
city's
Clock
Tower.
As
the
havoc
of
the
war
neared
his
home,
Zilean
experimented
with
powerful
temporal
magic
to
divine
all
possible
futures,
hoping
to
discover
a
peaceful
solution.
But
Zilean's
enchantments
affected
his
perception
of
the
passage
of
time,
and
he
was
in
a
contemplative
stasis
when
Urtistan
was
set
upon
by
an
entire
phalanx
of
dark
summoner-knights
of
unknown
affiliation.
By
the
time
he
realized
his
error,
Urtistan
was
nothing
more
than
smoldering
debris.
The
summoners
who
were
responsible
for
its
destruction
had
wisely
left
the
Clock
Tower
unharmed,
both
to
avoid
drawing
Zilean's
attention
and
to
torment
him
for
his
oversight.
Zilean
barely
had
time
to
grieve
the
momentous
loss
before
he
learned
that
his
dangerous
research
had
a
cruel
side
effect:
chrono-displasia.
This
mystical
disease
granted
him
immortality,
but
detached
his
consciousness
from
its
anchor
in
the
present
time.
He
now
mentally
drifts
through
time,
from
any
point
he
has
already
lived
to
the
present,
unable
to
impact
the
events
which
unfold.
The
most
torturous
aspect
of
this
curse
is
that
Zilean
sometimes
experiences
Urtistan
as
it
once
was
and
the
rest
of
the
time
resides
in
its
lonely
ruins.
Only
the
powerful
summoning
magic
employed
by
members
of
the
League
of
Legends
has
been
able
to
treat
this
condition,
and
Zilean
has
joined
in
hopes
of
finding
a
cure,
and
thereafter
a
way
to
save
his
people.
The
Clock
Tower
While
wandering
across
southern
Valoran,
Vel'Koz
and
his
fellow
void
"companions"
stumbled
upon
the
Ruins
of
Urtistan.
Fascinated,
Vel'Koz
deconstructs
one
of
the
ruins
and
analyzes
them,
discovering
that
place
once
held
powerful
magics.
He
ventures
within
the
Clock
Tower
to
discover
numerous,
highly
advanced
technology
within,
the
likes
of
which
even
he
himself
has
never
seen.
Analyzing
the
tower,
he
infers
that
the
Urtistanians
were
able
to
manipulate
time,
a
power
that
only
Zilean,
an
Urtistanian,
could
use,
and
that
the
owner
has
only
recently
left.
Now
obsessed
with
this
knowledge,
he
sets
out
to
find
its
owner.
Not
before
destroying
his
companions.
Trivia
According
to
Vel'Koz
,
Zilean's
Clock
Tower
holds
powerful
magic
and
highly
advanced
technology.
This
is
the
reason
why
their
city
was
attacked.
