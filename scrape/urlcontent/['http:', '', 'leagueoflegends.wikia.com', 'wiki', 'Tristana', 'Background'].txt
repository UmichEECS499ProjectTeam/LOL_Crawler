Friends

Rivals
Champion
The
Megling
Commandos
are
something
of
a
legend
in
Bandle
City
.
They
have
a
history
that
spans
centuries,
and
they
remain
the
oldest
yordle
military
unit
still
in
service.
They
are
renowned
for
their
courage,
deadliness,
and
ruthlessness,
making
them
the
most
respected
and
feared
of
all
warriors
in
Bandle
City.
Legends
of
Megling,
the
valiant
founder
of
the
commandos,
are
still
heard
throughout
Valoran
taverns.
It
was
these
legends
that
most
fascinated
a
young
Tristana.
Since
she
was
a
wee
child,
Tristana
wanted
nothing
more
than
to
become
the
crack
shot
that
her
idol
had
been
all
those
years
ago.
She
trained
her
entire
life,
until
finally
she
was
old
enough
to
join
the
military
and
able
to
earn
her
place
among
the
Megling
Commandos.
The
senior
officers
were
impressed
by
her
abilities,
claiming
that
Tristana
was
a
natural,
and
her
dream
was
realized
the
day
she
donned
her
Megling
fatigues.
Though
her
heart
lies
with
her
unit,
the
call
to
the
League
of
Legends
was
irresistible
and
now
Tristana
protects
Bandle
City
as
a
champion
.
While
intense
and
focused
as
a
Megling
Gunner,
Tristana
is
remarkably
different
in
her
personal
life.
Outside
the
Fields
of
Justice
,
she
is
friendly
and
cheerful
-
the
sort
of
yordle
who
always
has
a
kind
word
for
everyone.
Tristana
recently
struck
up
a
close
friendship
with
Teemo,
the
Swift
Scout
.
They
are
both
members
of
Bandle
City's
Special
Forces,
so
not
only
do
they
bond
as
yordles,
but
also
as
fellow
warriors
and
champions...
though
she
outright
ignores
any
questions
pertaining
to
a
blossoming
romance.
"If
there's
one
person
I'd
trust
to
take
on
a
difficult
mission,
it's
Tristana!"
―
Teemo
