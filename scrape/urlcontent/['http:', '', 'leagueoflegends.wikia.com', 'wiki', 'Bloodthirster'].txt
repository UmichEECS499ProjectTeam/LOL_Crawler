The
Bloodthirster
is
a
legendary
item
in
League
of
Legends
.
[1]
Background
Unearthed
near
the
marshes
of
Kaladoun,
the
Bloodthirster
is
thought
to
have
belonged
to
a
powerful
soulstealer
named
Frax
Van
Itt.
The
wielder
of
this
dangerous
weapon
is
forever
bound
to
the
blade
and
its
thirst
for
the
blood
of
others.

Gold
Efficiency
The
Bloodthirster
is
95.3%
gold
efficient
with
no
stacks.
Its
gold
efficiency
increases
by
1.4%
per
stack,
becoming
gold
efficient
by
the
fourth
stack
and
reaching
137.3%
gold
efficiency
at
maximum
stacks.
Similar
items
Sanguine
Blade
Seeker's
Armguard
Sword
of
the
Occult
Strategy
The
Bloodthirster
is
a
very
cost
effective
item
once
fully
stacked
.
For
the
combine
cost
of
850
gold
,
it
can
grant
8%
more
life
steal
than
a
Vampiric
Scepter
and
45
more
attack
damage
than
a
B.
F.
Sword
and
a
Long
Sword
.
Therefore,
at
the
maximum
30
stacks,
it
grants
essentially
double
the
stats
of
its
components
for
only
850
gold
.
Trivia
The
Bloodthirster
has
a
stacking
feature
where
minion
kills
count
(unlike
Sword
of
the
Occult
and
Mejai's
Soulstealer
,
where
only
champion
kills
and
assists
count).
Multiple
Bloodthirsters
stack
at
the
same
time;
it
is
not
necessary
to
stack
each
Bloodthirster
individually.
Destroying
turrets
adds
stacks
to
the
item.
When
this
item
has
25
stacks
or
more,
it
provides
the
second
highest
amount
of
attack
damage
from
a
single
item
in
League
of
Legends
,
after
a
fully
stacked
Sword
of
the
Occult
,
which
adds
110
attack
damage.
Maw
of
Malmortius
is
close
behind
at
95
damage
when
the
wielder
is
below
30%
of
their
maximum
health.
The
Bloodthirster
grants
more
attack
damage
per
gold
than
a
B.
F.
Sword
at
23
stacks
or
more.
Sanguine
Blade
is
The
Bloodthirster's
counterpart
on
the
Crystal
Scar
,
the
Twisted
Treeline
,
and
the
Howling
Abyss
.
The
Bloodthirster's
image
is
essentially
based
on
the
same
generic
sword
image
as
Sheen
,
with
a
different
orientation,
coloring,
and
detailing.
