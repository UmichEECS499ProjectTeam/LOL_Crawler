There
are
several
policies
as
to
what
type
of
pages
can
be
created.
Pages
which
fail
to
follow
these
policies
will
immediately
face
deletion.
Reasons
for
deletion
Reasons
for
deletion
include,
but
are
not
limited
to,
the
following:
Articles
about
minute,
non-notable
details
e.g.
"Ashe's
Arrow"
or
"Random
Decoration
in
Crystal
Scar"
Copyright
violations
e.g.
a
transcript
from
a
LoL
fan
site
Articles
of
galleries
or
repositories
of
images
e.g.
"Gallery
of
Summoner's
Rift"
or
"Gallery
of
Ryze's
skins"
Advertising,
vandalism
or
spam
without
relevant
content
e.g.
"See
my
cool
site",
"Mordekaiser
rockssss!"
or
"Garen
is
a
fool!!!!"
Articles
that
cannot
possibly
be
attributed
to
reliable
sources
Redundant
or
otherwise
useless
templates
Categories
representing
"overcategorization"
Files
that
are
unused,
obsolete,
or
otherwise
violate
our
image
policy
In
the
canon
namespace,
any
other
content
not
suitable
for
an
encyclopedia
For
encyclopedia
articles,
to
avoid
a
possible
deletion,
one
should
establish
the
notability
of
the
article's
subject.
Continued
attempts
to
create
content
that
is
later
summarily
deleted
should
be
sanctioned.
Processes
Pages
that
fulfill
at
least
one
of
the
above
criteria
should
be
tagged
with
{{delete}}
by
non-administrators,
and
be
deleted
by
an
administrator.
Any
objections
to
these
deletions
should
be
placed
on
the
candidates
for
deletion
talk
page
.
When
it
is
unclear
whether
a
page
fulfills
the
criteria
above,
or
when
it
does
not
fulfill
the
criteria
above
but
may
still
be
unnecessary,
pages
should
be
marked
with
{{VfD}}
.
Community
discussion
will
then
take
place
on
the
candidates
for
speedy
deletion
talk
page
to
determine
whether
this
page
is
kept,
merged
into
another
page,
or
deleted.
Images
Images
lacking
a
proper
source
will
be
flagged
with
the
{{
delete
}}
template.
The
respective
uploader
will
be
notified
with
an
automated
warning
message
telling
him
what
his
image
is
missing
and
how
to
fix
it.
This
template
categorizes
these
images
into
the
media
with
missing
information
category
during
three
days
and
after
that
it
switches
them
over
to
the
candidates
for
speedy
deletion
category.
Once
the
three
days
deadline
is
exceeded,
images
are
deleted
on
sight.
