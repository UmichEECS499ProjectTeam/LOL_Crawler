On
the
League
of
Legends
Wiki,
some
users
have
access
to
additional
technical
functions
and
tools
which
allow
then
to
preform
maintenance
tasks
and
revert
vandalism
with
greater
ease.
Any
member
of
the
community
with
extra
rights
received
them
via
community
vote,
and
is
trusted
to
use
them
well.
Any
member
of
the
community
is
eligible
to
apply
for
these
rights;
read
the
sections
on
each
of
the
different
groups
below
for
more
information.
Users
with
rights,
while
being
trusted
members
of
the
community,
are
not
any
better
or
more
important
than
anyone
else.
They
do
not
have
an
extra
vote,
or
veto
power,
and
their
votes
are
weighted
equally
with
that
of
users
that
do
not
have
added
rights.
