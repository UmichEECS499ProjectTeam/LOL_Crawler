Bio
NaJin
Sword
was
formed
on
May
30th,
2012,
shortly
after
NaJin
e-mFire
was
knocked
out
of
Azubu
The
Champions
Spring
2012.
MaKNooN,
e-mFire's
top
lane
player,
departed
from
his
team
and
began
recruiting
for
a
second
team
under
the
NaJin
organization.
The
original
squad
was
renamed
to
NaJin
Shield,
while
the
newly
acquired
roster
became
NaJin
Sword.
Sword
qualified
for
Azubu
The
Champions
Summer
2012
by
winning
their
best-of-three
play-in
against
Relive.
Although
expectations
for
the
team
were
low
due
to
their
inexperience
and
e-mFire's
lackluster
performance
in
the
previous
season,
Sword
was
able
to
defeat
Team
Dignitas
and
RoMg
in
the
group
stage
to
advance.
In
the
quarterfinal
round,
NaJin
Sword
faced
StarTale,
led
by
AD
player
Locodoco.
StarTale
were
undefeated
in
their
group
matches,
but
Sword
achieved
an
upset
and
swept
their
series.
However,
CLG
EU
emerged
victorious
in
their
semifinal
best-of-five.
This
set
up
a
third
place
match
against
Azubu
Blaze
,
which
Sword
were
able
to
win
2-0.
NaJin
Sword's
third
place
finish
gave
them
just
enough
circuit
points
to
qualify
for
the
Season
Two
Korean
Regional
Finals.
They
were
seeded
fourth
in
the
event,
but
in
a
dominant
showing,
Sword
tore
through
LG-IM,
Xenics
Storm,
and
Azubu
Blaze
to
shock
the
world
and
claim
Korea's
second
slot
in
the
Season
2
World
Championship.
The
Season
2
World
Championship
took
place
during
the
first
week
of
October
2012.
NaJin
Sword
was
favored
to
progress
through
their
group
and
did
not
disappoint,
taking
matches
over
CLG
EU,
Team
Dignitas,
and
Saigon
Jokers
and
advancing
as
the
top
team.
[1]
Although
many
writers
and
professionals
also
expected
Sword
to
place
in
the
top
4,
the
dark
horse
Taipei
Assassins
beat
them
convincingly
in
the
round
of
eight.
NaJin
Sword
left
the
event
in
5th-8th
place
and
won
a
prize
of
$
75,000.
