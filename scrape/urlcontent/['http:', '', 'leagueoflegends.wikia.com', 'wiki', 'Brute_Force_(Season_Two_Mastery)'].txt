The
subject
of
this
article
was
removed
from
League
of
Legends
in
patch
V1.0.0.152
.
The
information
displayed
is
no
longer
relevant
to
League
of
Legends,
but
exists
here
for
historical
purposes.

Â·
Utility
Brute
Force
is
a
first
tier
offense
mastery
with
3
ranks.
Effect
per
rank
Increases
your
champion's
attack
damage
by
1
/
2
/
3.
Requirements
None.
Strategy
Though
the
bonus
attack
damage
is
minimal
late
game,
the
extra
3
damage
can
end
up
netting
you
a
kill
during
the
laning
phase.
Brute
Force,
along
with
Butcher
(both
at
max
rank),
can
increase
the
damage
of
your
autoattacks
on
minions
and
monsters
by
7
points,
before
taking
into
account
the
target's
armor
.
This
can
be
very
handy
for
last
hitting
minions
in
the
laning
phase.
