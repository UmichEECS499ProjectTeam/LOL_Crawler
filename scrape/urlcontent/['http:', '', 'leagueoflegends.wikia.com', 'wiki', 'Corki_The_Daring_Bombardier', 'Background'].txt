Corki,
the
Daring
Bombardier

?
?
Friends
&
Rivals
Champion
When
Heimerdinger
and
his
yordle
colleagues
migrated
to
Piltover
,
they
embraced
science
as
a
way
of
life,
and
they
immediately
made
several
groundbreaking
contributions
to
the
techmaturgical
community.
What
yordles
lack
in
stature,
they
make
up
for
with
industriousness.
Corki,
the
Daring
Bombardier,
gained
his
title
by
test-piloting
one
of
these
contributions
-
the
original
design
for
the
Reconnaissance
Operations
Front-Line
Copter,
an
aerial
assault
vehicle
which
has
become
the
backbone
of
the
Bandle
City
Expeditionary
Force
(BCEF).
Together
with
his
squadron
-
the
Screaming
Yipsnakes
-
Corki
soars
over
Valoran
,
surveying
the
landscape
and
conducting
aerial
acrobatics
for
the
benefit
of
onlookers
below.
Corki
is
the
most
renowned
of
the
Screaming
Yipsnakes
for
remaining
cool
under
fire
and
exhibiting
bravery
to
the
point
of
madness.
Before
the
League
,
he
served
several
tours
of
duty,
often
volunteering
for
missions
which
would
take
him
behind
enemy
lines,
either
gathering
intelligence
or
delivering
messages
through
hot
zones.
He
thrived
on
danger,
and
enjoyed
nothing
more
than
a
good
dogfight
in
the
morning.
More
than
just
an
ace
pilot,
Corki
also
made
several
modifications
to
his
copter,
outfitting
it
with
an
arsenal
of
weapons
which
some
speculate
were
more
for
show
than
functionality.
When
open
hostilities
ceased
as
part
of
the
agreement
surrounding
the
formation
of
the
League,
Corki
was
forced
into
a
retirement
which
he
felt
"cut
the
engines
and
clipped
the
wings".
He
tried
to
make
do
with
stunt
flying
and
canyon
running,
but
it
was
never
the
same
without
the
refreshing
smell
of
gunpowder
streaking
through
the
air
around
him.
When
Heimerdinger
joined
the
League
of
Legends
,
it
was
no
surprise
to
see
Corki
follow
soon
after,
eager
to
test
his
mettle
against
the
best
the
world
has
to
offer.
"
He
is
Corki
-
death
from
above!

then
the
