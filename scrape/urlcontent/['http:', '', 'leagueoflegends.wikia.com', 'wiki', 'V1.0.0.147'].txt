bonus
damage
to

Scatter
the
Weak:
Spell
width
increased.
Dark
Sphere
:
Syndra
conjures
a
Dark
Sphere,
dealing
magic
damage.
The
sphere
remains
and
can
be
manipulated
by
her
other
abilities.
Force
of
Will
:
Syndra
picks
up
and
throws
a
minion
or
Dark
Sphere,
dealing
magic
damage
and
slowing
the
movement
speed
of
enemies.
Scatter
the
Weak
:
Syndra
knocks
enemies
and
Dark
Spheres
back,
dealing
magic
damage.

hit
by

become
stunned.
Unleashed
Power
:
Syndra
bombards
an
enemy
champion
with
all
of
her
Dark
Spheres.
Graves
Riot
Graves
is
now
properly
flagged
as
having
sunglasses.
General
The
time
window
for
multikills
has
been
increased
to
10
seconds
from
the
previous
kills
as
opposed
to
8.
Spectator
Mode
Spectators
can
now
rearrange
the
display
positions
of
any
player
on
the
scoreboard
in
the
bottom-center
of
the
screen
by
dragging
that
player's
bar.
The
scoreboard
has
been
rearranged
for
easier
team
comparisons:
Champion
portraits
have
been
moved
to
the
center
of
the
scoreboard,
with
minion
kills
immediately
adjacent.
Items
are
now
automatically
sorted
to
display
more
expensive
items
toward
the
center
of
the
scoreboard.
While
drag-scrolling
(default:
middle
mouse
click
+
drag),
the
camera
will
now
wait
to
move
until
the
player
drags
the
mouse,
rather
than
automatically
moving
in
the
direction
of
the
initial
click.
E.g.
if
a
player
middle-clicks
the
right
side
of
the
screen,
the
camera
will
no
longer
automatically
move
to
the
right.
Instead,
it
will
move
based
on
where
the
player
drags
the
mouse.
Max
scroll
speed
remains
the
same
and
caps
out
at
a
drag
length
equal
to
the
distance
between
the
center
and
edge
of
the
screen.
The
mouse
cursor
will
now
disappear
while
drag-scrolling.

this
patch,

the
