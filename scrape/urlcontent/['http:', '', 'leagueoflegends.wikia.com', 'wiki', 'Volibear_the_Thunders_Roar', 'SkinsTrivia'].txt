Trivia
Volibear
was
designed
by
Volty
.
Volibear
was
the
first
champion
to
be
released
in
Season
Two
.
Volibear
is
voiced
by
Patrick
Warburton
,
Who
also
voices
Zac
.
Volibear,
the
Thunder's
Roar,
is
a
response
to
the
ongoing
joke
on
the
League
of
Legends
forums
regarding
armored
bears.
[1]
[2]
[3]
[4]
The
champion
led
to
the
creation
of
pro-armored
bear
and
anti-armored
bear
factions,
with
leaders
being
the
designers
of
the
Riot
Team,
which
eventually
escalated
to
the
Riot
Wars.
[5]
[6]
[7]
His
name
is
derived
from
Travis
'Volibar'
George
,
the
Riot
producer
who
first
put
forth
the
idea
of
an
armored
bear
champion.
Volibear
is
possibly
inspired
from
the
armored
bears
(most
prominently
Iorek
Byrnison)
that
appear
through
out
Philip
Pullman's
His
Dark
Materials
trilogy,
known
as
Panserbjørne
(lit.
'armored
bears',
Danish/Norwegian
origin).
Atlantica's
Druid
Mercenary,
Hero
Naruk
,
also
seems
to
be
related.
When
there
is
an
enemy
Zilean
present
in
game,
Volibear
will
gain
the
Chronokeeper
Hater
icon
with
the
text:
"Not
even
Zilean
could
keep
an
armored
bear
out
of
the
League
of
Legends".
The
enemy
Zilean
also
gains
the
Armored
Bear
Hater
icon
with
the
text:
"In
my
day,
we
would
never
have
allowed
an
armored
bear
into
the
League
of
Legends."
The
allied
Zilean
is
unaffected.
Volibear's
dance
is
a
reference
to
Sam
B's
dance
from
America's
Got
Talent
.
A
side-by-side
comparison
can
be
seen
here
.
In
Volibear's
Champion
Spotlight,
his
skin
names
were
on
the
opposite
skins.
The
name
"Thunder
Lord"
was
on
the
Northern
Storm
skin
and
vice
versa.
Volibear's
skill
Rolling
Thunder
is
the
same
name
as
Henry
Fillmore's
famous
band
piece,
Rolling
Thunder,
featuring
the
low
brass.
Quotes
Volibear
has
special
quotes
when
slaying
Zilean
.
Whenever
Volibear
slays
Zilean,
he
will
remark:
"
Your
time
has
run
out,
Chronokeeper"
or
"
I
got
a
special
claw
for
you,
Zilean."
This
is
the
first
time
a
champion
kill
triggers
a
quote.
Volibear,
Renekton
,
and
Vi
are
the
only
champions
to
reference
another
champion
in
their
in-game
speech.
Volibear's
quote
"A
fool
and
his
head
are
easily
parted."
Is
most
likely
a
reference
to
the
Klingon
Proverb
"A
fool
and
his
head
are
soon
parted.",
which
was
first
used
in
the
1984
novel
"The
Final
Reflection".
It
is
also
a
reference
to
"A
fool
and
his
money
are
easily
parted"
Skins
Northern
Storm
Volibear
is
a
likely
a
reference
to
the
Soviet
Northern
Front
,
a
major
military
organization
created
during
the
Second
World
War
.
Thunder
Lord
Volibear
is
a
more
direct
reference
to
Iorek
Byrnison
,
the
king
of
the
Panserbjørne
from
the
His
Dark
Materials
trilogy.
Relations
Volibear
forged
an
alliance
with
Sejuani
to
battle
the
coming
Lissandra
.
Due
to
the
fact
that
the
Riot
design
director,
Zileas,
was
adamantly
against
the
implementation
of
armored
bears,
Volibear
and
Zilean
dislike
each
other.
In
addition
to
that,
Zilean's
fatalistic
attitude
towards
the
end
of
things
vs
Volibear's
defiance
against
Lissandra
and
the
Watchers
serves
another
legitimate
reason.
