ARAM
,
the
acronym
for
All
Random
All
Mid
,
is
a
supported
PvP
game
mode
in
League
of
Legends
.
Upon
entering
champion
selection,
ten
summoners,
five
on
each
team,
randomly
summon
a
champion
from
their
available
pool
of
champions
(owned
and
free
play).
They
are
allowed
to
"reroll"
their
champion,
based
upon
reroll
points
(a
maximum
of
2
rerolls
can
be
saved
up
at
once),
which
are
gained
by
both
playing
ARAM
games
and
having
a
diverse
champion
pool.
Players
may
also
try
to
trade
with
teammates
if
both
players
have
both
champions
available
to
them,
whether
through
purchase
or
the
current
weekly
champion
rotation.
History
All
Random
All
Mid
(ARAM)
was
originally
played
as
a
custom
game
on
the
Summoner's
Rift
map.
Many
players
enjoyed
the
gameplay
change,
focusing
only
on
5v5
fights
with
no
lane
phase
or
jungling.
A
small
community
of
players
crafted
a
set
of
standard
rules
for
this
type
of
game.
ARAM
quickly
became
the
most
popular
type
of
custom
game
and
the
community
vocally
asked
Riot
to
formally
support
the
game
mode.
After
some
time,
the
Proving
Grounds
map
was
revamped
from
being
solely
for
tutorials,
to
a
playable
one
lane
map.
Later,
the
Howling
Abyss
was
released
as
a
new
ARAM
map,
replacing
the
Proving
Grounds,
along
with
the
Freljord
update
and
ARAM
was
made
an
official
queue.
This
was
the
first
and
only
time
a
custom
game
mode
created
by
players
became
an
official
game
type
of
League
of
Legends.
Map
The
Howling
Abyss
is
a
single
lane
5v5
map
with
the
objective
to
destroy
the
enemy
nexus.
Two
lane
turrets
stand
in
your
way
with
one
inhibitor
positioned
before
two
nexus
turrets.
There
is
a
global
aura
that
reduces
healing,
while
boosting
mana
regen.
A
shop
in
either
team's
base
allows
champions
to
shop
for
items
at
the
beginning
of
the
map
or
after
they
have
died,
which
then
becomes
locked
to
a
player
once
they
have
passed
a
certain
threshold
(which
is
approximately
just
past
the
nexus
turrets).
The
fountain
does
not
restore
health
or
mana
and
Recall
is
disabled,
but
4
health
relics
spawn
at
3:15
along
the
lane,
respawning
every
30
seconds.

You
probably
stepped
on
a
health
relic
or
got
healed
by
a
teammate
by
accident.
