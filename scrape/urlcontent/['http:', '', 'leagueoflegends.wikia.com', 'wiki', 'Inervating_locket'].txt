Trivia
In
V1.0.0.101
,
Innervating
Locket
was
likely
remade
to
suppress
the
potential
supporting
power
of
Sona
.
Reintroduction
Innervating
Locket
was
rumored
to
be
re-introduced
in
Season
2.
Several
employees
at
GamesCom
'11
also
mentioned
a
possible
re-introduction
of
the
Innervating
Locket.
The
Journal
of
Justice
Volume
1,
Issue
28
included
a
very
big
"hint"
that
it's
being
reintroduced.
Notes
In
the
20th
Summoner
Showcase
,
Nikasaur
(A
Riot
employee),
linked
to
a
video
by
GeneralCacti
about
Udyr
and
an
innervating
locket.
Innervating
Locket
may
also
have
been
removed
due
to
Champions
like
Udyr
who
possess
low
cooldowns
on
their
abilities,
allowing
for
the
passive
on
Innervating
Locket
to
become
a
source
of
near
infinite
sustain
for
such
champions.
