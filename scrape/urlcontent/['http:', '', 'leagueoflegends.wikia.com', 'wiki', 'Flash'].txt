Strategy
Flash
can
easily
be
used
to
escape
from
or
catch
up
with
a
foe.
It
can
be
used
to
dodge
or
land
abilities.
It
can
also
be
used
to
move
over
walls,
either
for
a
quick
escape
or
in
response
to
an
opponent's
dash
.
Notes
The
cooldown
of
this
spell
can
be
reduced
by
Summoner's
Insight
and
boots
with
the
Distortion
enchantment.
When
both
are
combined,
Flash
has
a
cooldown
of
203
seconds.
Flash
cannot
be
activated
if
the
player
is
affected
by
hard
crowd
control
.
Flash
and
Teleport
cannot
be
cast
while
silenced.
This
does
not
hold
true
for
other
summoner
spells.
Trivia
For
a
time,
the
inclusion
of
Flash
in
the
game
was
hotly
debated
and
Riot
considered
removing
it
from
the
game
entirely,
with
parts
of
the
community
for
and
against
removal.
As
a
result,
it
has
suffered
several
nerfs.
