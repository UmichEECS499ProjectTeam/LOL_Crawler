Trivia
Nunu
is
the
name
of
one
of
the
developer's
dogs.
He
also
uses
it
as
a
nickname
for
his
wife.
In
thermodynamics,
Absolute
Zero
refers
to
a
state
where
the
temperature
of
a
system
is
at
the
theoretical
lowest
possible
limit:
approximately
-459.67
degrees
Fahrenheit,
-273.15
degrees
Celsius,
or
zero
Kelvin.
Nunu
was
designed
by
Guinsoo
.
The
Yeti's
name
is
Willump
.
After
changes
to
Zilean's
Chrono
Shift
AP
ratio,
Absolute
Zero
has
the
highest
single
AP
scaling
of
2.5
damage
per
1
AP
in
the
game.
Nunu's
base
health
at
level
18
is
the
highest
of
any
champion
at
2381
.
Nunu
is
voiced
by
Cristina
Ulloa,
who
also
voices
Amumu
and
Annie
.
Willump
is
voiced
by
Brian
Sommer,
who
voices
Tryndamere
and
Warwick
.
Nunu
and
Willump
will
drop
one
soul
each
,
for
a
total
of
two
souls!
[1]
It
is
a
Hidden
Passive.
While
similar,
Sejuani
and
Bristle
only
drop
one
soul
between
them.
This
had
led
to
a
joke
among
the
community
that
Sejuani
has
ginger
hair
in
reference
to
the
internet
meme
that
gingers
have
no
soul.
[2]
However,
Katarina
,
Leona
and
Miss
Fortune
are
redheaded
and
do
drop
a
soul
upon
death.
Sejuani
and
Bristle's
case
may
also
stem
from
the
religious
belief
that
animals
have
no
souls.
[3]
Quotes
Nunu's
taunt
is
a
reference
to
The
Hulk
from
Marvel
Comics
.
Nunu's
joke
is
a
reference
to
President
Theodore
Roosevelt's
famous
quote,
"Speak
softly
and
carry
a
big
stick."
Skins
Grungy
Nunu
skin
is
a
direct
reference
to

Sesame
Street
characters,

the
Grouch
and
the
Cookie
Monster.
In
the
Chinese
Sasquatch
Nunu
skin
he
is
wearing
a
Banshee's
Veil
.
Nunu
Bot
skin
is
a
reference
to
Angry
Goran's
Nunu
Bot
series.
The
screens
in
the
artwork
also
references
the
series,
displaying
the
words
"Push"
and
"Uploading
A.I.".
