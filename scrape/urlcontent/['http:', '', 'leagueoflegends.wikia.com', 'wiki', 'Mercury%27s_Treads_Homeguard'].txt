Notes
Homeguard
activates
upon
entering/spawning
on
your
starting
platform.
Simply
standing
on
the
stairs
will
not
grant
the
buff;
champions
must
stand
on
the
center
of
the
platform
where
they
are
dropped
after
spawning
or
recalling.
This
enchantment
dramatically
reduces
the
time
needed
to
fully
regenerate
at
the
fountain,
making
it
effective
at
outlasting
enemies
sieging
the
entrance
of
your
base.
For
that
reason,
it
is
a
strategic
choice
against
pushing
compositions,
especially
if
they
lack
the
CC
or
burst
damage
to
kill
defenders
before
they
go
back
to
base.
This
is
probably
where
the
name
of
item
came
from.
This
enchantment
is
only
available
on
Summoner's
Rift
.
It
is
possible
to
Teleport
to
a
distant
location
while
still
standing
on
the
starting
platform,
allowing
you
to
utilize
the
speed
elsewhere.
This
enchantment
ridiculously
speeds
up
your
walking
animation,
leading
to
some
hilarious
moments
on
champions
such
as
Nautilus
,
Pantheon
,
Vayne
,
and
Zac
.
