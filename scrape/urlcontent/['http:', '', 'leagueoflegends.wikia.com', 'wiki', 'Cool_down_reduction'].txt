"Claw
or
spear,
your
end's
the
same."
It
has
been
suggested
that
Cooldown
be
merged
into
this
article
or
section.
Please
discuss
this
here
.
Cooldown
reduction
(abbreviated
as
CDR
)
is
a
champion
statistic
that
reduces
the
cooldown
of
abilities
,
or
the
amount
of
time
you
must
wait
before
an
ability
can
be
used
again
once
you
activated
it,
by
a
percentage.
Cooldown
reduction
is
granted
by
items,
buffs,
runes
and
masteries,
as
well
as
some
passive
abilities.
Cooldown
reduction
stacks
additively.
For
example,
if
you
have
5%
cooldown
reduction
from
masteries
and
10%
cooldown
reduction
from
Stinger
,
you
will
have
15%
cooldown
reduction.
Cooldown
reduction
cannot
be
increased
beyond
40%.
One
cost
and
mastery
efficient
way
to
achieve
max
CDR
is
to
max
out
the
Sorcery
mastery
(5%)
and
purchase
any
20%
reduction
item
and
the
Ionian
Boots
of
Lucidity
(15%),
giving
a
total
of
40%
CDR.
The
cheapest
is
the
Ionian
Boots
and
Morellonomicon
(2200G).
Cooldown
reduction
is
determined
at
the
moment
an
ability
is
activated.
Increasing/decreasing
your
cooldown
reduction
while
the
skill
is
on
cooldown
will
not
affect
the
cooldown.
Cooldown
reduction
does
not
apply
on
item
active
abilities
such
as
that
of
Deathfire
Grasp
or
item
passive
effects
with
cooldowns
such
as
that
of
Guardian
Angel
.
Most
sources
of
cooldown
reduction
also
do
not
apply
on
summoner
spells
unless
specifically
stated,
e.g.
the
unique
enchantment
effect
of
Distortion
for
boots.
Cooldown
Reduction
does
not
apply
to
an
Innate
Ability
of
any
kind.
