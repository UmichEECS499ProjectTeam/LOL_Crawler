Urf,
the
Manatee
was
a
champion
created
as
an
April
Fool's
Day
joke
in
League
of
Legends
.
[1]
Urf
has
since
become
a
mascot
of
sorts;
making
regular
appearances
particularly
around
April
1st.
Abilities
Big
Blue
Watery
Road
Urf
is
naturally
faster
and
more
agile
in
bodies
of
water.
Flippy
Floppy
Active:
Urf
switches
weapons
between
fish
and
spatula
to
accommodate
the
needs
of
his
team.
Attacks
with
fish
deal
damage
over
time,
while
attacks
with
Spatula
deal
instant
damage
Poseidon's
Gaze
Active:
Urf
calls
upon
the
powers
of
the
Manatee
god,
Poseidon,
to
notify
his
allies
of
a
position
on
the
Fields
of
Justice.
Poseidon’s
Gaze
removes
Fog
of
War.
Flop
Strike
Active:
Urf
flops
onto
an
enemy
with
massive
destructive
force.
Urf
must
be
directly
next
to
an
enemy
to
successfully
execute
this
skill.
Omnisplash
Active:
Urf
calls
upon
the
elements
to
bring
forth
a
destructive
deluge
of
water.
All
nearby
enemies
take
water
damage
and
are
briefly
impaired
in
movement.
Lore
Background
Despite
the
traditionally
peaceful
ways
of
his
people,
Urf,
the
Manatee,
idolized
the
strength
and
prowess
of
Champions
in
the
League
of
Legends
and
strived
to
become
one.
Of
all
the
League's
Champions,
there
was
none
that
Urf
admired
more
than
Jax,
Grandmaster
at
Arms
.
Since
the
introduction
of
the
arena,
no
man
has
forced
the
League
of
Legends
to
revise
their
regulations
more
often
than
Jax,
and
the
self-proclaimed
Grandmaster
at
Arms
rattled
off
a
streak
of
152
consecutive
wins.
In
order
to
compensate
for
the
extreme
power
of
this
Champion,
the
League
created
special
sanctions
for
Jax:
He
is
only
allowed
to
fight
with
weapons
the
League
deems
suitable.
For
now,
that
list
includes
a
lamppost,
a
chicken's
foot,
a
spatula,
a
fishing
rod
and
a
cardboard
tube.
In
his
admiration
and
pursuit
to
become
a
weapons
master
like
Jax,
Urf
has
equipped
himself
with
the
two
great
symbols
of
his
Manatee
heritage
as
his
weapons:
a
fish
(to
symbolize
the
bounty
and
providence
of
the
sea)
and
spatula
(to
pay
homage
to
his
people's
age-long
pursuit
for
culinary
mastery).
Urf
now
begins
his
aquatic
journey
as
the
League's
first
Manatee
Champion,
hoping
one
day
he
will
have
the
opportunity
to
cross
fish
and
spatula
with
chicken's
foot
and
lamppost.
The
Remains
of
Urf
Death
Unfortunately,
today,
the
story
of
Urf
Day
took
a
tragic
turn,
for
as
Urf
was
swimming
along,
dutifully
guarding
the
river
in
the
Summoner's
Rift
,
he
met
with
a
tragic
demise.
Eye-witness
accounts
have
been
unreliable
at
best,
but
everyone
seems
to
agree
that
just
before
it
happened
a
blue
streak
was
seen
darting
out
of
the
nearby
jungle.
A
great
clamor
ensued,
followed
by
the
doleful
screams
of
a
manatee
done
wrong.
In
the
end,
all
that
was
left
of
this
brave
prince
amongst
sea
cows
was
his
skin...
and
even
that
was
stolen
by
this
most
nefarious
of
perpetrators.
Now
any
good
story
needs
a
moral.
So
if
there's
anything
that
the
story
of
Urf
Day
and
the
story
of
the
Big
Bad
Wolf
have
in
common,
it's
this:
deep
within
every
wolf,
there
is
a
cunning
master
of
disguise
just
waiting
to
get
out.
Take
Warwick
,
for
instance;
a
giant,
bloodthirsty
werewolf
able
to
cunningly
adapt
by
blending
into
even
the
most
innocent
of
surroundings.
He
could
be
anywhere
at
any
time...
behind
a
rock,
in
the
brush,
in
the
jungle,
or
cleverly
masquerading
as
a
lovable,
spatula-wielding
manatee.
[2]
April
Fool's
Day
Riot
Games
has
used
Urf
the
Manatee
two
years
in
a
row
for
the
April
Fool's
Day
celebration.
The
first
year
it
was
announced
as
a
Champion
for
the
Beta
Test
as
well
as
the
following
year.
Furthermore,
to
commemorate
the
occasion,
Riot
Games
launched
a
special
skin
for
Warwick
:
If
you
want
to
ensure
that
your
Blood
Hunter
appears
completely
inconspicuous
to
even
the
most
wary
of
foes,
be
sure
to
snatch
up
the
Urf
the
Manatee
skin,
on
sale
now
in
the
League
of
Legends
store.
Now,
you’ve
all
heard
about
Legendary
skins.
And
so,
in
light
of
the
recent
events,
Marketing
has
determined
that
the
Urf
the
Manatee
skin
is
now
even
more
Legendary
than
we
had
originally
anticipated.
As
such,
Warwick’s
Urf
the
Manatee
skin
will
be
available
at
the
cost
of
5,000
RP.
However,
in
the
interests
of
giving
everyone
the
opportunity
to
pay
their
respects
to
this
magnificent
mammal,
Marketing
has
also
agreed
to
offer
this
tribute
to
his
splendor
at
99%
off
for
one
week
only.
That’s
right:
I
said
99%
off!
At
a
cost
of
only
50
RP,
you
have
no
reason
to
shirk
paying
tribute
to
the
passing
of
this
brave
soul!
During
the
second
week
of
availability,
the
Urf
the
Manatee
skin
will
be
purchasable
for
500
RP
(still
not
a
bad
deal,
considering
that’s
90%
off).
And
on
Urf’s
final
day,
if
you
haven’t
yet
snatched
him
up,
you’ll
have
one
final
chance
to
do
so
for
5000
RP.
So
hurry
and
fire
up
the
League
of
Legends
store,
already!
It’s
Urf
Day!
Urf
the
Manatee’s
final
resting
place
is
the
Skins
section
of
the
Store.
Our
thoughts
and
prayers
go
out
to
the
victim’s
family.''

Urf
Proceeds
to
Benefit
Manatee
Conservation
The
April
Fool's
joke
was
so
successful
that
Riot
decided
to
donate
the
earnings
of
that
day
to
SaveTheManatee.org,
a
charitable
organization
dedicated
to
saving
these
majestic
creatures.
[3]
While
we
knew
that
Urf
was
pretty
fantastic,
there
was
no
way
for
us
to
possibly
foresee
the
level
of
community
response
Urf's
death
would
garner.
You
were
moved
by
the
tragedy
of
the
event,
and
so
were
we.
We
were
so
moved,
in
fact,
that
we
wanted
to
guarantee
that
Urf
would
live
on
in
the
hearts
and
minds
of
everyone
as
a
champion
of
all
manatees.
And
so,
to
help
ensure
that
no
sea
cow
shall
have
to
suffer
the
same
fate
as
our
poor,
beloved
Urf,
all
the
proceeds
generated
by
the
sales
of
Urf’s
skin
on
Urf
Day
have
been
donated
to
the
Save
the
Manatee
Club.
And
given
that
over
15,000
Runeterrans
chose
to
celebrate
the
memory
of
this
majestic
marine
mammal
in
style
by
sporting
their
very
own
Urf
suit,
that’s
no
pocket
change!
Even
in
death,
Urf’s
indomitable
spirit
endures
to
help
his
fellow
sea
cows
in
their
hour
of
need!

Trivia
A
few
of
Urf's
skills
are
in
reference
to
the
song
"I'm
on
a
Boat"
by
the
Lonely
Island.
Most
notably
are
Flippy
Floppy,
Big
Blue
Watery
Road,
Poseidon's
Gaze
("Poseidon
look
at
me!"),
and
an
old
skill,
Straight
Floatin'.
Urf's
skill
"Omnisplash"
is
likely
a
reference
to
Cloud
Strife's
final
Limit
Break
from
Final
Fantasy
VII,
"Omnislash."
Urf's
skill
"Flippy-Floppy"
is
thematically
similar
to
Jinx's
Switcheroo!
,
in
that
Urf
uses
a
different
weapon
depending
on
whether
the
ability
is
toggled
on
or
off.
