&
Trivia
Skill
usage
Martial
Cadence
can
only
affect
a
unit
once
in
6
seconds,
so
it
is
a
good
idea
to
target
another
unit
or
champion
to
activate
the
passive
during
that
time.
Try
to
remember
in
which
order
you
hit
your
enemies
with
Martial
Cadence
,
so
you
can
immediately
use
it
on
them
again
when
6
seconds
are
up.
Using
Dragon
Strike
to
harass
the
enemy
is
useful.
Keep
Dragon
Strike
off
cooldown
for
initiation,
chasing
or
last-hits.
Golden
Aegis
can
slow
retreating
enemies
to
finish
them
off.
Combine
Golden
Aegis
,
Demacian
Standard
and
Dragon
Strike
in
this
order
to
finish
fleeing
enemies
if
your
ultimate
is
not
available.
Placing
a
Demacian
Standard
increases
the
stats
of
allies
as
well
as
one's
own.
Remember
that
Jarvan
IV
gains
both
his
passive's
and
the
standard's
bonus
stats.
Placing
a
Demacian
Standard
in
a
team
fight
can
be
very
rewarding,
as
not
only
do
you
aid
your
allies
in
battle,
but
you
also
get
more
assists
whenever
one
of
your
allies
kills
an
enemy
while
having
the
Demacian
Standard
buff
(even
if
you
didn't
deal
damage
to
the
enemy
champion).
Try
to
initiate
with
Demacian
Standard
+
Dragon
Strike
as
opposed
to
Cataclysm
.
Most
enemies
will
use
Flash
to
avoid
the
knock
up,
and
then
your
ultimate
will
be
even
more
powerful
because
they
can't
escape
it.
Jarvan
IV
can
have
a
deceptively
long
nuke
radius.
Consider
using
your
Demacian
Standard
and
Dragon
Strike
combination
to
close
distance
on
a
target,
and
using
Cataclysm
immediately
afterwards
for
the
nuke.
You
could
also
add
Flash
to
the
combo
to
close
the
gap
even
further.
Be
wary,
as
Cataclysm
is
one
of
the
few
abilities
in
the
game
that
can
actually
bring
about
the
death
of
an
ally,
by
trapping
them
at
low
health
with
an
enemy
or
a
turret
.
Therefore
remember:
Cataclysm
terrain
can
be
undone
by
activating
it
again,
releasing
you
and
your
teammates
if
trapped.
Using
Cataclysm
to
cage
multiple
enemies
is
a
great
way
of
dealing
damage
to
them
without
harming
your
own
teammates.
Be
careful
where
and
when
you
place
it,
as
it
may
not
turn
out
to
be
in
your
favor.
Using
Cataclysm
at
the
wrong
time/place
can
cause
unnecessary
death
to
you
or
your
teammates,
for
example
caging
the
wrong
enemy
out
or
caging
low-
health
allies
within.
Enemy
champions
such
as
Shaco
,
Ezreal
,
Shen
,
or
other
champions
with
a
similar
short-ranged
teleport/dash
ability
(including
Flash
)
can
easily
escape
Cataclysm
.
Be
aware
of
this
when
using
Cataclysm
on
these
targets.
Be
careful
when
using
Cataclysm
on
enemy
champions
that
do
high
AoE
damage
to
enemies
around
them,
such
as
Amumu
or
Kennen
,
or
in
range
of
enemy
champions
that
have
ranged
AoE
abilities,
such
as
Brand
or
Malzahar
.
Accidentally
trapping
your
teammates
with
or
within
range
of
these
types
of
champions
will
make
it
so
they
take
full
damage
from
otherwise
avoidable
AoE
abilities.
If
built
to
survive,
Jarvan
IV
can
start
a
team
fight
with
great
success.
He
also
deals
damage
well
without
many
items.
While
building
him,
strive
to
maintain
both
survivability
and
damage.
A
team
with
skills
such
as
Bandage
Toss
can
be
used
to
get
inside
the
Cataclysm
and
complement
Jarvan
IV's
ability
to
initiate
well.
Jarvan
IV
can
also
escape
his
own
Cataclysm
with
a
Demacian
Standard
and
a
Dragon
Strike
combo.
Using
Demacian
Standard
-
Dragon
Strike
-
Cataclysm
on
1
champion
is
a
good
initiation
tactic
and
will
allow
your
team
to
focus
a
target.
Combining
well-placed
Demacian
Standard
with
Dragon
Strike
can
disrupt
the
enemy
enough
to
turn
the
tide
in
a
battle.
This
can
also
be
used
to
chase
an
enemy
or
cut
them
off
by
pulling
yourself
across
terrain.
During
a
chase,
Cataclysm
can
be
used
to
stop
allies
from
being
chased.
Simply
use
Cataclysm
on
the
enemy
champion
and
escape
the
ring
with
a
Demacian
Standard
and
a
Dragon
Strike
combo.
When
Cataclysm
is
on
cooldown,
you
can
use
the
Demacian
Standard
and
Dragon
Strike
combo
to
help
your
teammates
escaping
anyway.
Wait
for
the
enemies
to
walk
past
you,
then
use
your
combo
and
Golden
Aegis
immediately
after
to
stop
nearly
any
chaser
in
their
tracks.
With
enough
CDR,
level
5
Dragon
Strike
can
be
activated
twice
to
combo
with
a
single
Demacian
Standard
.
Build
usage
A
Jarvan
IV
player
should
consider
an
early
stacking
of
attack
damage
to
ensure
lane-dominance.
The
armor
reduction
of
Dragon
Strike
makes
the
physical
damage
of
Jarvan
IV
synergize
very
well
with
flat
armor
penetration.
The
Brutalizer
provides
key
offensive
stats
at
a
cheap
price
and
decent
upgrade
paths.
It
is
recommended
that
players
build
half
tank
and
attack
damage...this
is
believed
to
be
is
much
better
than
any
other
choice.
Jarvan
IV
is
a
tanky-DPS,
benefiting
from
Sheen
,
and
later
Trinity
Force
.
If
your
enemy
keeps
running
away
from
you,
consider
buying
a
Frozen
Mallet
to
get
a
stronger
slow.
Randuin's
Omen
is
a
good
item
for
Jarvan
IV,
along
with
his
Golden
Aegis
,
Jarvan
can
be
a
great
AoE
debuffer.
If
Jarvan
IV
builds
Randuin's
Omen
,
Frozen
Mallet
and
Atma's
Impaler
he
will
gain
a
lot
of
armor
and
Damage.
The
high
scaling
on
his
Dragon
Strike
and
Cataclysm
will
give
him
a
good
amount
of
burst,
making
him
a
strong
anticarry
with
these
items.
Building
a
Blade
of
the
Ruined
King
will
significantly
increase
Jarvan
IV's
DPS
(the
passive
and
attack
damage
alone,
without
the
passive
and
attack
speed,
will
be
more
effective
than
a
full
stacked
Bloodthirster
versus
targets
above
3000
maximum
health)
and
improve
his
burst.
The
passive,
combined
with
Martial
Cadence
,
will
deal
an
incredible
14.5%
of
the
target's
health
on
the
first
attack
plus
your
Attack.
Combined
with
the
active,
one
can
potentially
deal
almost
30%
of
the
target's
health
+
basic
attack
damage
without
using
any
abilities.
The
active
also
adds
another
form
of
CC
to
Jarvan
IV's
already
impressive
kit.
Finally,
with
his
high
natural
Attack
Speed
from
Demacian
Standard
Jarvan
IV
will
be
able
to
benefit
greatly
from
the
passive
effect
and
lifesteal.
Choosing
between
Atma's
Impaler
and
Blade
of
the
Ruined
King
will
depend
on
one's
build.
A
Tank
Jarvan
IV
with
Randuin's
Omen
,
Frozen
Mallet
,
Warmog's
Armor
and
Spirit
Visage
will
benefit
more
from
Atma's
Impaler
,
while
a
more
offensive,
damage
or
low-health
Jarvan
IV
with
items
such
as
The
Black
Cleaver
,
Thornmail
,
Trinity
Force
or
Last
Whisper
will
benefit
more
from
a
Blade
of
the
Ruined
King
.
Basically,
Atma's
Impaler
is
the
defensive
offensive
choice,
while
Blade
of
the
Ruined
King
is
the
offensive
DPS
choice.
Blade
of
the
Ruined
King
grants
very
little
Attack
Damage
though.
If
it's
Jarvan
IV
only
damage
item,
his
burst
will
suffer
slightly.
An
Atma's
Impaler
on
full
Tank
Jarvan
IV
will
grant
about
70
AD,
which
adds
70
+
70
x
1.5
=
175
damage
to
Jarvan
IV's
E+Q+R
combo,
while
a
Blade
of
the
Ruined
King
adds
only
25
+
25
x
1.5
=
62.5
damage.
Blade
of
the
Ruined
King
's
active
however
should
be
able
to
compensate
for
the
loss
of
burst.
Jarvan
IV
is
one
of
the
best
anti-AD-Carry
in
the
game.
He
has
natural
high
armor
from
Demacian
Standard
,
a
reliable
gap
closer
with
a
knockup
build-in
and
his
ult,
which
forces
enemies
to
fight
him
up
close.
Therefore,
building
armor
items
such
as
Thornmail
(returns
damage
before
armor's
damage
reduction),
Randuin's
Omen
(using
the
active
right
after
Cataclysm
ends
will
make
escaping
more
difficult),
Frozen
Heart
(best
used
against
multiple
Attack
Speed
reliant
champions)
and
Sunfire
Cape
(
Cataclysm
will
keep
them
in
its
range)
can
be
very
beneficial
to
Jarvan
IV.
On
the
other
hand,
players
might
want
to
use
his
natural
bonus
armor
to
avoid
building
armor
a
little
longer.
With
only
a
Randuin's
Omen
,
Jarvan
IV
will
have
160
Armor,
leaving
room
for
other
items
to
increase
either
his
damage
or
his
Magic
Resist/Health.
Like
all
tanky
DPS
and
tanks,
Jarvan
IV
enjoys
Warmog's
Armor
to
help
him
survive
while
and
after
initiating
a
fight.
The
Black
Cleaver
is
a
must-have
on
offensive
Jarvan
IV.
Combined
with
Dragon
Strike
,
Jarvan
IV
can
reduce
multiple
enemies'
armor
with
up
44.5%,
in
addition
to
ignoring
a
flat
10
Armor.
Zeke's
Herald
is
a
perfect
item
for
Jarvan
IV
later
on
in
the
game
as
it
gives
the
health
he
needs
while
giving
a
bit
of
damage.
The
aura
also
helps
synergize
with
Demacian
Standard
by
giving
your
allies
free
ad
and
lifesteal
to
encourage
them
to
fight
after
an
initiation.

When
engaging,
be
careful
because
he
has
a
high
endurance
due
to
his
Golden
Aegis
and
Demacian
Standard
.
When
facing
Jarvan
IV
,
remember
that
stacking
health
increases
Martial
Cadence
damage
out
on
you.
Although
the
bonus
damage
has
a
cap
of
400,
it
is
still
quite
devastating.
Therefore,
stacking
armor
is
better.
Jarvan
IV
has
a
strong
early
game.
Be
careful
when
playing
aggressively
when
laning
against
him.
A
combo
of
Cataclysm
,
Dragon
Strike
and
Demacian
Standard
will
prevent
you
from
chasing
him.
For
this
reason,
wait
until
his
Cataclysm
is
on
cooldown
before
engaging
him.
The
ring
of
Cataclysm
can
be
escaped
using
virtually
any
dash
in
the
game.
Having
one
off
cooldown
can
quickly
nullify
the
value
of
the
ring.
Do
not
underestimate
Jarvan
IV's
1v1
potential.
His
damage
output
and
his
Cataclysm
make
him
a
dangerous
fighter.
Be
even
more
careful
of
him
with
his
allies
about.
His
abilities
have
a
multitude
of
utility
effects
that
can
let
his
team
win
against
yours
easily
even
if
you
personally
are
able
of
fighting
Jarvan
IV's
1v1.
While
Jarvan
IV's
knock-up
is
threatening,
do
remember
that
it
relies
on
his
Demacian
Standard
,
which
is
on
a
13
second
cooldown.
If
you
can
get
away
from
the
flag,
he
won't
be
able
to
knock
you
up
again.
Scatter
around
before
engaging
a
team
with
Jarvan
,
it
will
make
his
ultimate
less
effective
when
he
can
only
trap
one
person.
Take
great
notice
of
Jarvan
IV's
team.
If
it
consists
of
heavy
AoE
(
Morgana
,
Brand
,
Fiddlesticks
,
Malphite
,
etc.)
then
consider
fighting
the
enemy
on
your
grounds
than
theirs,
or,
if
possible,
eliminate
Jarvan
IV
before
the
team
fight
starts
to
make
their
ultimates
less
effective.
Due
to
the
great
utility
of
Jarvan
IV
,
he
can
participate
in
a
"kill
lane"
(a
lane
where
the
aim
is
killing
the
enemy,
generally
two
bruisers
against
a
support/AD
carry
in
bottom
lane:
popular
duo
is
Jarvan
+
Leona
).
If
you
see
such
a
setup,
consider
using
Alistar
or
other
non-ultimate
disruptive
supports
to
stop
the
kill
lane's
success.
Using
a
silence
on
Jarvan
IV
will
stop
him
from
dashing
to
you,
or
even
casting
his
ultimate.
You
might
want
to
save
your
silences
for
that.
Even
better,
sometimes
the
ultimate
is
used
to
do
damage
and
crumble
the
wall.
A
silence
will
prevent
him
from
crumbling
the
wall,
making
quick
work
of
him
in
a
bad
position.
Attempt
and
avoid
basic
attack
harassment
by
Jarvan.
Due
to
his
passive,
it
will
almost
double
his
basic
attack's
damage
in
early
levels,
making
you
generally
unable
to
pay
it
back
and
leading
to
low
health.
Jarvan
IV
has
incredible
escaping
abilities
and
can
jump
over
nearly
any
wall
with
Dragon
Strike
and
Demacian
Standard
,
while
buffing
his
health
with
Golden
Aegis
and
slowing
any
chasers.
When
ambushing
him
or
engaging
in
the
jungle,
try
to
have
someone
cut
off
his
escape
by
walking
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall.
Beware
of
the
knockup
of
his
combo
though.
In
lane,
beware
of
Jarvan
IV's
Dragon
Strike
when
staying
near
your
minions,
as
it
deals
high
base
damage,
has
a
surprising
range
and
a
low
cast
time,
allowing
Jarvan
IV
to
farm
minions
even
when
defended
by
an
enemy
champion.
