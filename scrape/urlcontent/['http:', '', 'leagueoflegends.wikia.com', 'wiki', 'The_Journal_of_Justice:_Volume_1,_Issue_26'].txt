Kalamanda
to
Become
Field
of
Justice
Mining
grounds
discovered
salvageable,
construction
underway
Kaldera
Carnadine
reporting
from
Kalamanda
High
Councilor
Vessaria
Kolimnye
and
Mayor
Anson
Ridley
oversee
construction
of
Kalamanda’s
Field
of
Justice.
Just
days
after
the
League’s
unprecedented
intervention
against
Noxus
and
Demacia’s
war
in
Kalamanda
,
a
portion
of
the
magically
contaminated
region
has
been
found
to
be
salvageable
and
will
be
re-purposed
into
an
official
Field
of
Justice
.
As
construction
begins,
representatives
from
Noxus
and
Demacia
have
arrived
at
the
Institute
of
War
to
negotiate
a
resolution
to
their
ongoing
conflict.
During
the
League’s
evaluation
of
Kalamanda
this
weekend,
surveyors
discovered
that
the
mining
grounds,
located
between
the
two
nexuses
unearthed
last
year,
had
suffered
far
less
damage
than
the
surrounding
village.
“We
believe
the
Nexuses
absorbed
and
stabilized
a
great
deal
of
the
magic
that
would
have
otherwise
rendered
the
mining
grounds
as
uninhabitable
and
unstable
as
the
rest
of
Kalamanda,”
said
Master
Summoner
Randall
Portero,
Lead
Field
of
Justice
Surveyor
for
the
League.
“It
will
be
an
enormous
task,
but
we
can
bend
what
magic
remains
within
the
area
to
power
a
Field
of
Justice.”
The
decision
was
announced
late
last
night
by
High
Councilor
Heywan
Relivash
at
the
Institute
of
War
to
a
gathered
group
of
summoners,
refugees,
and
city-state
representatives.
“After
the
dire
events
of
last
week,
we
believed
Kalamanda
lost
to
us,
doomed
to
remain
a
stain
upon
the
landscape
and
the
history
of
Valoran
.
Through
this
initiative,
we
may
reclaim
Kalamanda.
We
may
transform
a
shattered
warfront
into
a
place
for
political
resolution
without
direct
conflict.
This
Field
of
Justice
will
stand
a
symbol
of
prevailing
peace
and
a
reminder
of
why
the
League
of
Legends
exists.”
Those
gathered
for
the
announcement
responded
in
great
favor
to
the
initiative.
“While
the
people
of
Kalamanda
mourn
the
loss
of
our
home,
what
happened
there
must
never
be
forgotten,”
said
Mayor
Anson
Ridley,
speaking
for
the
town’s
displaced
refugees.
As
League
surveyors,
masons,
and
artificers
begin
construction
in
Kalamanda,
Noxian
and
Demacian
ambassadors
continue
negotiations
at
the
Institute
of
War.
King
Jarvan
III
arrived
to
represent
Demacia
and,
as
no
Grand
General
has
been
determined,
Jericho
Swain
represents
Noxus.
As
of
this
morning,
no
resolution
has
come
to
light.
“The
news
of
a
new
Field
of
Justice
is
heartening
indeed,”
commented
League
Champion
Kayle
,
who
has
presided
over
negotiations
alongside
the
High
Councilors,
“but
the
threat
of
war
still
lingers
in
the
halls
of
the
Institute.
This
is
but
a
momentary
respite:
we
have
not
yet
found
peace.”
Our
Forward
March
Demacian
Duty
in
the
Face
of
Treachery
Aria
Breker
reporting
from
Demacia
Those
of
us
fortunate
enough
to
have
survived
the
wars
before
the
League
shall
suffer
no
difficulty
recalling
the
horrors
committed
by
the
Noxian
war
machine.
These
are
undoubtedly
painful
memories
for
all
of
us,
yet
in
the
wake
of
the
events
in
Kalamanda,
we
must
again
confront
them.
Noxus
left
our
families
broken:
the
children
of
these
wars
grew
up
without
mothers
and
fathers.
Even
twenty
one
years
after
the
formation
of
the
League
of
Legends,
we
still
feel
the
sting
of
these
wounds.
We
remember,
too,
that
such
wounds
are
not
unique
to
Demacia
alone.
Our
compatriots
in
Ionia
faced
near-unspeakable
atrocities
at
the
hands
of
Noxian
soldiers
and
their
reckless
chemists.
Remember
the
Freljordian
tribes
butchered
in
Noxus’
Pacification
campaign
in
the
north.
Imagine
the
faces
of
their
children
standing
among
our
own
in
Demacian
orphanages,
robbed
of
a
peaceful
life
by
warmongering
villains
who,
if
not
for
the
unfaltering
devotion
of
the
Demacian
army,
would
have
poisoned
the
soil
of
Valoran
with
blood
from
sea
to
sea.
Some
would
place
the
blame
for
this
war
upon
Demacia,
claiming
us
hypocrites
and
conspirators.
People
of
Valoran,
know
this:
Demacia
has
once
again
heard
the
call
of
justice
to
strike
down
a
state
that
would
smile
to
see
the
people
of
Valoran
on
their
knees.
We
follow
the
Measured
Tread:
“In
our
eternal
forward
march,
we
must
stomp
out
evil
all
across
Valoran
wherever
it
may
grow.
Leave
no
stone
unturned:
the
roots
of
one
ignored
weed
will
inevitably
corrupt
the
whole
of
the
garden.”
Citizens
of
Demacia,
do
not
falter
in
your
convictions:
when
Prince
Jarvan
Lightshield
IV
raised
his
spear
against
General
Jericho
Swain,
he
did
not
do
so
to
begin
a
war.
Our
prince,
in
proud
Demacian
tradition,
took
arms
against
a
state
that
wears
the
skin
of
a
sheep
to
hide
wolf’s
teeth.
We
strike
to
sever
Noxus
from
Valoran
like
a
diseased
limb.
Never
again
will
we
allow
the
insatiable
bloodlust
of
the
Noxian
army
to
gnaw
upon
the
peace
provided
by
the
League
of
Legends:
at
Noxus’
every
step,
Demacia
will
hold
the
line—for
justice
and
for
peace.
Demacia:
now
and
forever.
Noxus
Cries
Havoc!
City-State
in
Uproar
in
Wake
of
League
Intervention
Richor
Ebony
reporting
from
Noxus
While
a
history
draped
in
the
glory
of
combat
has
hardened
the
citizenry
of
Noxus
with
the
expectation
of
loss,
we
stand
in
the
wake
of
a
truly
unprecedented
event
in
our
proud
nation’s
history.
Never
before
has
a
General
of
the
High
Command
been
struck
down
so
cruelly
or
senselessly.
Our
ancient
rivals
–
having
stooped
lower
than
ever
in
their
thirst
for
our
blood
–
have
awakened
in
us
a
rage
beyond
comprehension.
Day
and
night,
the
howl
of
our
citizen
soldiers
can
be
heard
echoing
through
the
streets
and
alleys
amid
the
drums
of
war
and
the
sharpening
of
blades.
The
forges
shall
burn
long
into
the
night
as
the
war
machine
of
Noxus
turns!
While
the
High
Council
of
Equity
has,
in
their
infinite
wisdom,
seen
fit
to
intercede
against
us
on
behalf
of
these
violators
of
the
League’s
peace,
the
people
of
Noxus
remain
defiant
as
ever.
With
our
Eternal
General
Boram
Darkwill
struck
down,
we
rally
to
the
side
of
our
esteemed
council
of
commanders.
The
members
of
the
High
Command
have
put
aside
their
personal
vendettas
for
honor’s
sake,
instead
focusing
their
efforts
on
a
single,
shared
agenda:
to
revenge
a
wrongdoing
against
our
Empire
and
the
people’s
pride
that
cannot
be
allowed
to
stand.
While
our
counterattack
might
be
stymied
by
League
intervention
for
the
time
being,
they
cannot
change
the
resolve
that
beats
in
the
heart
of
this
defiant
warrior
of
the
Empire.
Proclaiming
our
fervor
unmerited,
they
would
bid
us
do
nothing
while
they
squabble
and
debate
over
the
right
course.
If
this
is
an
unjust
war
it
is
one
begat
through
the
hypocrisy
of
a
state
founded
pretense
of
virtue,
but
the
practice
of
treachery.
It
was
Demacia’s
own
crown
prince
that
struck
the
first
blow
after
our
legions
held
their
disciplined
reserve
following
their
leader’s
assassination.
The
League’s
accusations
of
warmongering
are
as
slanderous
as
there
are
unfounded,
and
their
refusal
to
serve
justice
against
these
self-righteous
murders
will
not
be
soon
forgotten
within
our
hallowed
walls.
The
time
for
discourse
has
passed.
A
storm
is
coming.
And
our
memory
is
long.
Forever
strong!

Senior
Summoner
Ralston
Farnsley
commenting
from
the
Institute
of
War
These
past
few
weeks
in
Valoran
have
been
tumultuous,
dear
readers.
Summoners
and
citizens
alike
have
written
to
us
concerning
the
League’s
controversial
actions
in
Kalamanda,
both
in
support
and
in
furious
dissent.
Let
it
be
known
that
your
voices
do
not
go
unheard.
Since
the
time
of
its
inception,
the
League
of
Legends
has
been
an
entity
tasked
only
with
the
defense
of
Valoran.
The
League
is
not
a
government,
but
its
measures,
even
when
drastic,
are
not
above
the
criticism
and
dissatisfaction
of
the
citizens
we
strive
to
protect.
Citizens
of
Valoran,
speak
as
you
will,
and
the
League
will
answer.
“I
realize
that
the
Journal
of
Justice
is
not,
directly,
the
voice
of
the
Institute
itself.
However,
you
are
also
those
who
are
the
most
closely
aligned
with
the
Institute.
As
such,
I
would
like
to
dictate
an
open
letter
to
the
High
Council
of
Equity
of
the
proud
Institute
I
have
served
with
such
dedication.''
You
have
betrayed
my
trust.
The
League
was
formed
as
an
entity
meant
to
bring
peace
and
stability
to
Runeterra
.
A
fine
goal.
However,
in
this
most
recent
action,
I
believe
that
the
League
has
presumed
too
much.
You
have
risked
the
lives
of
hundreds
of
Summoners,
destabilized
an
entire
region,
and
destroyed
a
priceless
magical
artifact.
You
have
risked
the
life
and
sanity
of
every
soldier
inside
of
this
dark
magic
you
have
cast
just
as
much
as
the
war
before
it
with
the
dark
specter
of
Chrono-displasia
looming.
And
who
gave
you
the
right
to
make
this
momentous,
hard-hitting
decision?
No
one.
You
have
spoken
to
no
other
authority
save
yourselves.
You
have
not
discussed
this
momentous
cost
and
danger
with
any
other
city-state,
for
them
to
weigh
in
on
the
value
of
the
lives
of
the
Institute's
finest
or
its
artifacts,
for
other
options
to
be
put
forth.
This
rash,
costly
action
makes
me
fear
for
Valoran,
which
has
put
so
much
stock
into
the
good
judgment
of
this
High
Council.
There
was
no
magic
in
this
conflict.
The
battleground
had
been
evacuated.
Those
at
risk
wanted
to
be
at
risk.
You
had
the
time
to
come
to
a
reasonable
solution.
I
am
disappointed.”
–
Mädchen,
Summoner
of
Noxus
High
Councilor
Kiersta
Mandrake
herself
offered
this
response
to
your
concern:
“Every
one
of
the
summoners
involved
in
the
pacification
of
Kalamanda
participated
willingly.
That
aside,
your
concern
is
well-founded,
but
understand
this:
the
contamination
of
Kalamanda
is
regrettable,
but
it
is
a
necessary
sacrifice
for
the
safety
of
all
of
Valoran.
Our
concern
was
not
whether
or
not
the
soldiers
of
Noxus
and
Demacia
had
utilized
magic
but
the
knowledge
that
any
war
will
inevitably
spread
across
the
land.
The
League
of
Legends,
with
the
interest
of
Valoran’s
citizens
at
stake,
could
not
allow
such
a
threat
to
remain
unchecked.”
"I
am
certain
that
I
speak
for
many
citizens
of
Valoran
when
I
say
that
I
thank
the
League
of
Legends
for
the
intervention
in
Kalamanda.
Given
her
standing
amongst
the
highest
summoners
of
the
League,
I
am
curious
as
to
what
League
Champion
Kayle
has
to
say
about
the
situation,
however."
–
Tourniquette
The
Judicator
has
been
heavily
involved
in
overseeing
the
negotiations
between
Noxus
and
Demacia
at
the
Institute
of
War.
In
response
to
your
question,
Kayle
stated
the
following:
“The
League
of
Legends
has
acted
upon
its
primary
reason
for
existence:
to
protect
the
citizens
of
Valoran.
Noxus
and
Demacia
acted
in
selfish
and
reckless
disregard
for
the
armistice
established
twenty
one
years
ago.
The
actions
taken
against
to
cease
their
destructive
engagement
are
just—I
have
seen
firsthand
what
unchecked
war
can
do
to
a
people,
and
I
can
say
no
measure,
however
dramatic,
is
too
severe
to
prevent
it.
All
that
remains
to
be
seen
is
whether
or
not
the
truly
guilty
parties
involved
will
meet
justice
as
well.”
“Your
recent
breaking
news
article
in
the
Journal
of
Justice
regarding
the
forced
pacification
of
the
conflict
at
Kalamanda
has
brought
some
disturbing
thoughts
to
my
mind.
The
High
Councilor
is
quoted
stating
"We
are
not
a
governing
body,
we
are
not
enforcers,
we
are
the
collective
will
of
the
citizens
of
Valoran,
and
we
demand
a
new
future",
and
yet,
I
see
very
much
enforcers
of
a
will.
Although
this
time
the
will
of
the
League
may
match
that
of
the
Valoran
people,
can
we
always
assume
it
will?
Within
the
League
now
sits
the
most
powerful
artifacts
and
magicians
in
Runeterra.
There
is
no
balancing
force.
Who
makes
sure
the
League
remains
true
to
the
wishes
of
her
people?
Even
though
the
League
managed
to
stop
the
fighting
at
Kalamanda,
the
area
is
now
magically
unstable-
the
same
sort
of
magical
instability
that
the
League
was
created
to
prevent.
It
is
a
slippery
road.
Today's
reasons
may
be
just,
but
can
we
always
say
the
same
of
tomorrow's?
These
thoughts
weigh
heavily
on
my
heart,
and
I
would
hear
the
words
of
any
champion
who
would
be
willing
to
comment,
although
I
am
particularly
interested
in
what
the
Kinkou
,
the
self-proclaimed
keepers
of
Balance,
have
to
say
about
this
disturbing
turn
of
events."
–
F.E.
League
Champion
Shen
,
present
at
the
Institute
of
War
following
the
League’s
intervention
in
Kalamanda,
was
able
to
offer
a
response
to
your
inquiry
:
“The
Kinkou
have
reflected
upon
the
League’s
actions
in
Kalamanda
a
great
deal.
As
the
days
pass,
we
focus
upon
one
principle:
order,
often
times,
rises
from
chaos.
To
enact
judgment
upon
the
situation
now
would
be
to
strike
without
true
understanding,
as
it
is
the
purpose
of
the
League
of
Legends
to
maintain
harmony
within
Valoran.
Whether
or
not
that
purpose
has
been
fulfilled
remains
to
be
seen.
The
Kinkou
remain
watchful.”
