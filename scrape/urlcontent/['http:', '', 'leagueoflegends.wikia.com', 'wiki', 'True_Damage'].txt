True
damage
is
one
of
the
three
types
of
damage
in
League
of
Legends
,
the
others
being
magic
damage
and
physical
damage
.
True
damage
ignores
armor
and
magic
resistance
,
as
well
as
other
forms
of
damage
reduction
such
as
Unbreakable
Will
and
Vengeful
Maelstrom
.

Blocking
true
damage
Abilities
or
summoner
spells
which
deal
true
damage
are
still
blocked
by
effects
that
prevent
damage
such
as
the
passive
on
Banshee's
Veil
,
Sivir's
Spell
Shield
,
Nocturne's
Shroud
of
Darkness
,
and
Standard
Attacks
which
deal
additional
true
damage
are
still
capable
of
being
blocked
by
Pantheon's
Aegis
Protection
.
Kayle's
Intervention
will
block
all
damage
to
a
target
champion,
including
true
damage.
Before
the
removal
of
Dodge
,
both
true
damage
as
an
on-hit
effect
and
true
damage
on
standard
attack
were
capable
of
being
avoided
completely
if
the
standard
attack
was
dodged,
however
during
the
effect
of
Counter
Strike
,
Jax
can
still
effectively
dodge
true
damage
from
on-hit
effects
and
true
damage
from
standard
attacks.
Countering
true
damage
Although
true
damage
cannot
be
directly
mitigated,
it
is
possible
to
diminish
its
relative
effect.
Against
true
damage
that
does
a
flat
amount
of
damage
such
as
Cho'Gath's
Feast
,
building
health
will
diminish
how
much
damage
it
does
to
you
(as
the
ability
does
a
lesser
%
of
your
health).
The
only
ability
this
will
not
work
against
is
Vayne's
Silver
Bolts
which
deals
a
%
of
max
HP
as
true
damage.
However
in
this
case,
building
a
Frozen
Heart
and/or
Randuin's
Omen
will
reduce
the
true
damage,
by
reducing
how
fast
she
can
trigger
the
ability,
in
addition
it
protects
you
immensely
from
physical
damage,
Vayne's
primary
damage
source.
Absorption
shields
such
as
Janna's
Eye
Of
The
Storm
will
also
protect
you
from
both
flat
true
damage
and
Vayne's
Silver
Bolts
as
it
does
not
treat
the
shield
as
part
of
max
health
and
damage
will
go
through
the
shield
first.
Magic-only
shields
such
as
Morgana's
Black
Shield
and
the
passive
on
Hexdrinker
and
Maw
of
Malmortius
will
have
no
impact
on
true
damage.
Dealing
true
damage
Champions

deal
true
damage

Corki's

Notes
Despite
popular
belief,
champions
whose
abilities
have
health
costs
associated
with
them
do
not
deal
true
damage
to
themselves
when
they
use
an
ability
which
requires
health
to
cast.
This
can
be
evidenced
when
they
have
an
absorption
shield
on
them,
when
they
use
their
health-based
ability,
the
cost
of
it
penetrates
the
shield
and
directly
drains
the
health
of
the
user,
in
contrary
to
true
damage
that
has
to
break
any
absorsion
shield
on
the
target
to
reach
it's
hitpoints
The
Nexus
Obelisk
(spawn
point)
turrets
at
the
heart
of
either
team's
base
deals
1000
true
damage
which
cannot
be
mitigated
by
any
means,
even
by
abilities
that
make
the
champion
invulnerable.
Prior
to
patch
V1.0.0.108
,
shields
and
invulnerability
worked
against
these
turrets,
effectively
allowing
some
champions
to
"safely"
dive
into
the
enemy
spawn.
True
damage
is
unaffected
by
damage
reductions
such
as
Exhaust
.
True
damage
is
not
amplified
by
the
masteries
Havoc
or
Executioner
As
of
patch
V3.15
,
true
damage
is
no
longer
amplified
by
abilities
such
as
Poppy's
Diplomatic
Immunity
,
Swain's
Torment
,
and
Talon's
Cutthroat
.
