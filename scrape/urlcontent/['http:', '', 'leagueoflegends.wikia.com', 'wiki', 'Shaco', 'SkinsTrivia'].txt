Trivia
Adam
Harrington
in
League
of
Legends
(00:38)
Adam
Harrington
as
Shaco
Shaco
has
obvious
similarities
to
The
Joker
of
the
Batman
franchise,
such
as
his
mysterious
origins,
his
appearance
(his
face
is
often
drawn
with
a
long,
sharp
nose
and
a
big
smile,
and
they
both
have
white
skin),
his
voice,
and
some
of
his
quotes
which
references
Joker-esque
quotes
throughout
the
Batman
franchise.
His
story's
description
of
him
as
"Valoran's
first
fully
functioning
homicidal
comic"
is
a
direct
reference
to
Tim
Burtons's
Batman
where
Joker
describes
himself
as
"the
worlds
first
fully-functioning
homicidal
artist".
Shaco
was
voiced
by
Adam
Harrington,
the
same
voice
actor
for
Karthus
,
Kassadin
,
Mordekaiser
and
Ryze
.
"Shaco"
is
an
anagram
of
"Chaos".
Shaco
is
one
of
a
few
champions
to
actually
have
multiple
textures
in
one
skin.
When
he
uses
Hallucinate
,
his
clone
is
a
different
color
than
that
of
the
real
Shaco,
although
this
can
only
be
seen
by
Shaco
and
his
allies.
To
the
opposing
team,
the
two
Shacos
look
exactly
the
same,
unless
you
have
some
sort
of
external
buff
or
item
effect
active.
Shaco's
dance
is
The
Worm
.
A
side-by-side
comparison
can
be
seen
here
.
Shaco
was
designed
by
Guinsoo
.
[1]
Shaco
was
one
of
the
champions
chosen
for
the
Noxian
pool
available
during
the
Ionia
vs.
Noxus
match
.
However,
he
was
not
one
of
the
selected
champions.
Shaco
once
stabbed
Ram
Steed
almost
to
death
after
Ram
Steed
interviewed
him.
[2]
His
name
probably
comes
from
"shako",
which
is
the
cilindric
hat
the
light
infantry
used
to
wear
in
the
18th
century
and
later;
Shaco
wears
a
cilindric
hat
in
some
of
his
skins
as
well.
Assuming
it
is,
the
letter
C
may
have
been
subbed
to
create
an
anagram
of
the
word
"Chaos"
for
creative
effect.
It
is
also
a
possible
reference
to
the
Harlequin
Crest
,
a
Diablo
2
Unique
item.
The
unique's
base
item
is
the
"Shako".
Two-Shiv
Poison
icon
is
reference
to
opening
scene
in
An
Andalusian
Dog
.
Quotes
His
taunt
"
Why
so
serious?
"
is
a
reference
to
The
Dark
Knight,
being
the
famous
catchphrase
uttered
by
The
Joker
throughout
the
movie.
Leblanc
and
Shaco's
joke
are
almost
identical.
Shaco
says
"
For
my
next
trick,
I'll
make
you
disappear!
"
whereas
LeBlanc
says
"
For
my
next
trick,
I'll
make
their
life
bar
disappear
."
Leblanc
and
Shaco's
joke
is
similar
to
a
phrase
said
by
Kefka
from
Final
Fantasy
VI
at
min
3.25
Skins
Mad
Hatter
Shaco
is
a
reference
to
the
Mad
Hatter
of
Alice
in
Wonderland
;
Annie
has
a
counterpart
skin
called
Annie
in
Wonderland
.
Batman
also
has
an
enemy
named
Mad
Hatter,
and
considering
Shaco's
similarities
with
The
Joker,
could
also
be
classified
as
Trivia.
Shaco's
Champion
Spotlight
was
released
on
the
same
day
as
Asylum
Shaco
Workshop
Shaco
is
a
reference
to
Karl
Ruprecht
Kroenen
from
the
Hellboy
franchise,
and
is
depicted
as
a
clockwork
killing
machine.
This
reference
is
further
supported
by
the
League
of
Legends
post
announcing
the
skins
release,
which
states
'Go
ahead
and
wind
him
up,
if
you
dare.'
as
the
first
mechanical
toys
ran
on
clockwork
mechanisms
instead
of
batteries.
In
his
Classic
skin's
artwork,
the
spike
on
Shaco's
right
shoulder
pad
is
visible,
but
on
his
in-game
model
it
is
not.
Masked
Shaco
is
a
commemorative
skin
created
to
celebrate
League
of
Legends
'
first
anniversary
in
Korea.
[3]
[4]
It
is
currently
available
to
them
only.
Prior
to
it's
original
name,
Masked
Shaco
is
also
the
third
light
themed
skin
for
a
dark
themed
champion.
The
others
being
Arclight
Varus
and
Justicar
Syndra
The
texture
for
Masked
Shaco's
Jack
In
The
Box
looks
similar
to
Karma
in
it's
appearance.
This
may
just
be
coincidence,
as
the
jacks
are
often
supposed
to
be
similar
in
appearance
to
the
skin
itself.
Relations
It
has
been
confirmed
by
Riot
that
there
is
a
friendly
relationship
between
Shaco,
Nocturne
,
and
Fiddlesticks
.
Interestingly
enough
they
are
3
of
the
5
champions
to
use
the
fear
mechanic,
others
being
Hecarim
and
Volibear
.
