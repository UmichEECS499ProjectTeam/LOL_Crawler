You
can
help
the
League
of
Legends
Wiki
by
casting
Wild
Growth
on
it
so
it
isn't
as
small
as
a
yordle.
Doran's
Workshop
was
a
private
server
where
tentative
and
experimental
changes
were
tested
and
iterated
on.
It
was
originally
called
the
Private
Test
Realm
(PTR).
This
server
was
only
available
to
Riot
Games
employees
and
hand-selected
members
of
the
community.
The
server
and
forums
were
permanently
closed
on
July
18,
2012
following
a
leak
of
patch
notes
for
an
experimental
champion
remake.
