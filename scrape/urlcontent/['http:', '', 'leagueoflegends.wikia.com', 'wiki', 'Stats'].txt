Stats
A
champion
statistic
is
a
number
indicating
how
well
a
champion
can
do
a
certain
thing.
These
help
define
the
assets
of
a
champion
.
There
are
17
official
statistics,
divided
into
four
categories:
Offensive,
Defensive,
Magic,
and
Movement.

Increasing
Statistics
All
champions
begin
the
game
with
a
certain
amount
of
attack
damage
,
attack
speed
,
armor
,
health
,
health
regeneration
,
mana
,
and
mana
regeneration
.
This
is
commonly
referred
to
as
the
base
value
of
that
statistic
for
that
champion.
All
champions
naturally
increase
these
stats
by
a
certain
amount
every
time
they
gain
a
level
(except
Thresh
,
who
does
not
gain
armor
per
level
but
instead
relies
on
his
passive).
Each
champion's
base
statistics
and
per-level
statistics
are
unique
and
play
a
large
role
in
game
balance
for
that
champion.
Two
statistics
that
deviate
from
this
pattern
are
movement
speed
and
magic
resistance
.
Every
champion
has
a
unique
base
movement
speed
that
does
not
increase
naturally,
and
every
champion
begins
the
game
with
exactly
30
magic
resistance.
Magic
resistance
is
the
only
statistic
that
increases
for
some
champions
and
not
for
others.
In
general,
if
a
champion
is
ranged
or
has
a
ranged
form
or
is
classified
as
a
tank
,
they
will
not
gain
magic
resistance
per
level.
All
other
statistics
have
a
natural
value
of
zero
and
must
be
increased
by
other
sources.
The
ways
a
champion
may
increase
their
statistics
are
varied
and
include
runes
,
masteries
,
items
,
and
auras
.
Some
champion
abilities
increase
that
champion's
statistics,
either
as
a
passive
effect
(
Fiora's
Riposte
passively
increases
her
attack
damage
as
well
as
Nasus's
Soul
Eater
passively
increases
his
life
steal
)
or
as
an
active
effect
(
Ryze's
Desperate
Power
briefly
increases
his
movement
speed
and
spell
vamp
)
or
as
an
effect
that
follows
another
action
(
Nocturne's
Shroud
of
Darkness
,
for
example,
passively
increases
his
attack
speed
and
doubles
this
bonus
when
he
absorbs
a
spell).
Notes
On
this
wiki,
champion
statistics
such
as
health
,
attack
damage
,
etc.
are
listed
as
having
a
given
base
value.
This
is
the
value
before
achieving
Level
1.
Thus
champion
statistics
at
a
given
level
are
found
by
multiplying
that
level
(including
level
1)
by
the
amount
per
level
increase,
and
adding
the
base.
This
is
an
important
distinction
primarily
at
level
1.
Any
unit's
attack
damage
,
ability
power
,
attack
speed
,
movement
speed
,
armor
,
magic
resistance
,
can
be
seen
by
selecting
that
unit
in
game,
along
with
two
bars
indicating
their
current
and
maximum
health
and
mana
(or
equivalent
resource).
If
the
value
is
written
in
blue,
that
champion
has
only
the
base
amount
of
that
statistic.
If
the
value
is
written
in
green,
that
statistic
has
been
increased
from
the
base
amount
through
external
means.
Critical
strike
damage
is
not
shown
on
the
champion
statistic
page
in
game.
Conversely,
range
is
shown,
although
it
is
not
one
of
the
official
statistics.
On
the
champion
statistic
screen,
Magic
Penetration
is
listed
as
Spell
Penetration
.
On
the
champion
statistic
screen
in
spectator
mode,
Dodge
is
listed,
despite
having
been
removed
from
the
game.
