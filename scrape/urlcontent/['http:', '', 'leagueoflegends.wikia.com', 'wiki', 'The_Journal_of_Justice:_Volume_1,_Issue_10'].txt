Ionia
Accepts
Challenge
Setting
the
stage
for
a
momentous
grudge
match
Quinton
Groat
reporting
from
Ionia
The
hotly
contested
provinces
of
southern
Ionia:
Galrin,
Navori,
and
Shon-Xan.
Two
weeks
ago,
Chancellor
Malek
Hawkmoon,
the
officer
in
charge
of
Noxian
forces
in
Ionia
,
shocked
Runeterrans
by
announcing
that
Noxus
was
willing
to
offer
Ionia
an
early
rematch
for
control
of
its
three
southern
provinces:
Galrin,
Navori,
and
Shon-Xan.
An
official
statement
was
released
by
Karma,
the
Duchess
of
Ionia
,
this
morning:
"Friends,
we
consider
ourselves
fortunate
to
be
able
to
address
you
today
with
a
message
of
hope
not
only
for
our
beloved
Shojin
monk
,
who
continues
to
suffer
in
the
Lotus
Gardens,
but
also
for
all
who
live
in
oppression
throughout
Runeterra.
Many
have
criticized
Ionia's
pacifistic
stance
during
the
Rune
Wars,
and
some
have
claimed
that
we
paid
a
deserved
price
when
Noxus'
shock
troops
landed
on
our
shores.
It
is
true
that
our
peaceful
views
left
us
at
a
military
disadvantage,
but
we
overcame
monstrous
odds
against
us
and
fought
back
the
well-oiled
war
machine
of
Noxus,
the
biochemical
terror
of
Zaun
,
and
the
ruthless
pillaging
of
Bilgewater
.
We
did
this
alone,
without
foreign
aid,
and
amidst
rivers
of
blood
and
tears."
"Ionia
remains
incomplete
as
long
as
Noxian
forces
occupy
our
land
and
oppress
our
people.
We
appreciate
the
Chancellor's
generous
offer
of
an
early
rematch.
We
also
appreciate
his
words
stating
that
Noxians
are
a
people
deserving
of
human
liberties.
We
would
like
the
citizens
of
Noxus
to
know
that
it
was
our
appreciation
of
this
fact
that
kept
us
from
engaging
in
so
many
foreign
conflicts
in
which
we
considered
Noxian
motives
and
philosophies
to
oppose
our
own.
We
have
never
requested
assistance
from
Noxus
to
repair
the
damage
dealt
during
their
invasion,
nor
aid
to
'modernize'
our
civilization.
However,
since
debating
Noxus'
justifications
for
the
occupation
was
not
the
heart
of
Hawkmoon's
speech,
it
shall
not
be
mine.
We
officially
accept
your
challenge,
Malek,
and
we
will
send
our
very
best."
Before
she
left
the
podium,
Karma
added:
"One
more
thing:
should
Noxus
wish
to
surrender
before
the
match,
we
will
be
absolutely
willing
to
negotiate
the
terms."
Several
champions,
especially
those
involved
in
the
invasion,
have
already
volunteered
to
represent
their
respective
city-states
in
the
match.
Irelia
,
Ionia's
current
Captain
of
the
Guard,
sought
the
Elders'
endorsement
to
join
the
League
the
same
day
that
Malek
made
his
speech.
She
was
officially
accepted
this
past
Tuesday,
and
she
has
already
submitted
herself
as
a
candidate
for
the
match.
Master
Yi
and
Soraka
have
also
expressed
strong
desires
to
be
included
in
the
roster.
Noxian
champions
have
been
equally
enthusiastic
to
participate
in
the
match.
Sion
,
Warwick
,
and
Singed
made
appeals
to
the
High
Command
to
be
considered.
Katarina
tendered
her
own
candidacy
after
publically
retorting
to
Karma's
comments:
"Itâ€™s
nice
to
see
that
when
granted
an
opportunity
to
save
their
'beloved
monk'
and
achieve
their
independence
from
'oppression',
Ionia
responds
with
open
sarcasm
and
disdain.
I
will
enjoy
crossing
blades
with
you
on
the
Fields
of
Justice
...and
Karma,
if
you
ever
tire
of
hiding
behind
your
podium,
I'll
be
happy
to
carve
out
some
time
out
for
a
visit."
While
the
city-states
make
preparations,
the
League
has
opened
a
draft
of
summoners
to
determine
who
will
summon
these
champions
into
battle.
It
will
be
a
careful
process
due
to
the
rumors
of
foul
play
involved
with
the
previous
match.
The
League
has
stated
that
it
will
be
posting
bulletins
for
prospective
summoners
to
apply.
Troll
Parties
Raid
Frontier
Settlements
The
troll
hunt
begins
Richor
Ebony
commenting
from
Noxus
Ruhgosk
trolls
raid
human
settlements
near
the
Ironspike
Mountains
Even
with
the
barbarian
threat
somewhat
alleviated
due
to
their
recent
unification
with
Freljord
,
the
cold
lands
to
our
north
seem
determined
to
prove
themselves
inhospitable
to
civilized
man.
The
frequency
of
attacks
by
trolls
--
once
rare
in
all
but
the
wildest
of
frontier
towns
--
has
escalated
to
epidemic
proportions
in
the
northeastern
region
of
the
empire.
Territorial
disputes
between
these
trolls
have
displaced
entire
tribes,
putting
all
peaceful
human
settlements
in
the
region
in
jeopardy
as
troll
raiding
parties
wander
down
from
the
Ironspike
Mountains
in
search
of
food
and
weapons.
A
Noxian
task
force
has
been
stationed
in
the
northeastern
region,
and
preliminary
reports
from
captured
marauders
have
laid
the
blame
for
their
warmongering
on
the
resurgence
of
the
Ruhgosk
tribe.
This
tribe,
once
renowned
for
their
remarkable
intelligence
and
cunning,
was
the
largest
and
most
powerful
of
their
troll
brethren
before
a
wasting
disease
ravaged
their
numbers.
During
the
Ruhgosks'
moment
of
weakness,
the
other
tribes
fell
upon
them,
seizing
ancient
Ruhgosk
tribal
lands
and
hunting
their
infected
brothers
to
near
extinction.
It
has
been
said
that
the
Ruhgosk
have
found
deliverance
from
their
malady
in
a
most
unlikely
source
and
have
managed
to
save
their
tribe.
A
Ruhgosk
tribal
warrior
known
as
Trundle
has
ritualistically
taken
on
the
suffering
of
his
tribe
with
the
help
of
the
presiding
shamans,
becoming
a
festering
beast
of
disease
sustained
only
by
his
remarkable
regenerative
powers.
With
their
curse
lifted
and
their
terrifying
savior
leading
the
charge,
the
Ruhgosk
have
reemerged
to
reclaim
their
hereditary
lands.
The
usurper
tribes,
proving
to
be
no
match
for
the
fury
of
Ruhgosks'
renewed
vigor,
have
been
shattered
and
forced
to
resort
to
nomadism.
A
Noxus
peacekeeping
force,
led
by
renowned
troll
expert
and
Bleak
Academy
Professor
Hakolin,
was
dispatched
to
the
area
in
an
effort
to
parley
with
the
trolls'
tribal
leaders
and
arrange
a
peaceful
solution
to
the
fighting.
Despite
advancing
under
a
banner
of
peace,
his
vanguard
has
met
with
nothing
but
violence
when
attempting
to
approach
the
various
troll
encampments.
With
this
diplomatic
avenue
closed
off,
the
High
Command
has
seen
fit
to
proclaim
the
trolls
of
the
Ironspike
Mountains
enemies
of
the
state,
rendering
it
the
duty
of
any
good
and
loyal
citizen
of
Noxus
to
do
them
harm
if
they
are
able.
Moreover,
a
bounty
has
also
been
issued
against
the
troll
menace,
allowing
private
citizens
and
soldiers
to
exchange
trophies
from
their
hunting
parties
for
currency.
Whether
the
tales
of
an
avenging
troll
martyr
are
true
or
simply
the
deranged
ramblings
of
these
superstitious
creatures,
the
havoc
they
are
sowing
is
very
real.
Noxian
forces
in
the
area
have
already
begun
the
hard
work
of
organizing
a
militia
in
the
threatened
territories,
as
well
as
fortifying
townships
against
further
attack.
Additionally,
Noxus'
entire
Northern
Legion
is
in
the
process
of
being
consolidated
just
south
of
the
Noxus-Freljord
border
to
better
ensure
the
safety
of
the
populace.
The
Noxian
people
have
endured
adversity
at
the
hands
of
many
over
the
course
of
our
proud
history,
each
time
emerging
ever
more
resolute.
We
shall
meet
this
troll
threat
as
we
always
have:
with
courage
and
valor.
Our
efforts
shall
ensure
that
human
civilization
prevails
over
aberration
in
the
Ironspikes.
Forever
strong!
Warwick
Escapes
Kidnapper
The
Blood
Hunter's
tale
of
confinement,
torture,
and
madness
Quinton
Groat
reporting
from
Zaun
Last
night,
authorities
in
Zaun
were
called
to
a
bloody
scene
on
Zaun
steets
in
the
northern
Gozzryn
sector.
A
rampaging
beast
-
later
determined
to
be
Warwick,
the
Blood
Hunter
-
was
savagely
attacking
Zaunite
civilians.
By
the
time
authorities
arrived,
Warwick
had
already
slain
five
and
injured
three
others.
He
further
managed
to
injure
three
officers
before
local
mages
were
able
to
suppress
him
and
bring
him
in
for
questioning.
Dalo
Forukin,
the
first
officer
on
the
scene,
recounts:
"He
was
completely
feral.
His
fur
was
dark
brown,
and
he
had
broken
shackles
cuffing
his
wrists.
His
back
was
bloody
with
lash
wounds.
It
seemed
like
he
didn't
understand
us
when
we
spoke
to
him,
and
his
eyes
darted
around
wildly
as
though
everything
was
a
threat.
Personally,
Warwick
is
one
of
my
favorite
champions.
I've
seen
maybe
a
hundred
of
his
matches
and
I
never
once
saw
him
look
this
savage.
A
lot
of
people
forget,
due
to
his
appearance,
that
he
is
actually
a
brilliant
chemist.
He's
responsible
for
several
of
Zaun's
techmaturgical
breakthroughs.
It
was
truly
awful
to
see
him
in
that
state."
Authorities
were
unable
to
calm
Warwick,
so
they
reached
out
to
the
only
person
who
they
thought
would
be
able
to
get
through
to
him:
Singed.
The
Mad
Chemist
made
good
use
of
his
shield
while
trying
to
reason
with
the
beast
before
he
decided
to
employ
another
tactic.
Singed
brewed
a
brown,
fizzling
concoction
and
force-fed
it
to
Warwick.
After
half
an
hour
of
choking,
the
Blood
Hunter
seemed
to
regain
his
senses,
although
his
appearance
remained
the
same.
Singed
then
spent
the
next
hour
with
authorities,
coaxing
from
Warwick
the
story
of
what
happened.
"I
was
walking
down
the
street
in
Gozzryn.
It
reeked
of
rotting
refuse.
I
heard
a
snapping
sound,
like
someone
stepped
on
a
twig,
coming
from
an
alley
I
just
passed.
Suddenly
I
felt
overwhelming
heat
surging
through
my
body.
I
couldn't
move,
and
the
fiery
pain
didn't
stop
until
I
lost
consciousness.
When
I
awoke,
I
was
chained
to
a
brick
wall
in
a
dank
basement.
Some
piece
of
scum
coated
himself
in
garbage
so
I
wouldnâ€™t
smell
him
coming."
"The
gutless
vermin
was
a
man,
at
least
I
think
it
was
a
man,
wearing
a
Zaunite
radiation
suit.
When
he
spoke,
his
voice
was
deep
and
robotic,
like
what
you'd
expect
if
Blitzcrank
had
a
cold.
He
wasn't
a
robot
though,
he
was
a
victim
of
a
Zaunite
bio-assault
-
or
so
I
would
guess."
Warwick
grinned,
proud
of
his
work.
"He
asked
me
if
I
remembered
the
faces
of
the
children
I
'murdered'
in
Ionia
as
he
branded
me
with
some
kind
of
glowing
whip.
He
injected
me
several
times
with
unknown
substances
that
made
me
more
susceptible
to
pain
and
sent
my
mind
into
chaos.
I'm
not
certain
whether
I
was
hallucinating
or
not,
but
at
one
point
it
looked
like
he
pulled
back
the
radiation
mask,
and
his
face
underneath
was
half-mutated,
as
though
he'd
been
exposed
to
some
tissue-warping
toxin.
I've
never
seen
anything
like
it
in
all
of
my
experiments.
If
I
ever
find
him
again,
I
will
put
his
filthy
mutated
head
on
a
pike."
The
torture
apparently
drove
Warwick
completely
insane,
and
made
him
even
more
bestial.
His
kidnapper
seemed
to
know
that
Warwick
would
eventually
be
able
to
break
free
of
his
chains,
because
he
gave
him
one
final
injection
before
packing
up
and
leaving.
The
crimes
Warwick
committed
in
his
wild
state
were
categorized
as
"unintentional
side
effects
of
advanced
experimentation",
and
pardoned
in
full.

Ram
Steed
,
your
eye
inside
the
League
of
Legends
Oh
what
would
we
do
without
the
League
of
Legends?
Sure,
it's
all
but
eliminated
war
in
our
time,
but
it's
given
us
so
much
more
than
that!
The
victories,
the
defeats,
the
pageantry!
It's
magic
in
a
can,
although
I
suppose
someone
will
want
to
correct
me
and
say
that
would
be
techmaturgy.
Don't
slow
my
poetic
roll!
The
sands
of
time
drain
on,
and
faithful
Ram
Steed
has
been
climbing
through
the
dunes
for
the
juiciest
tidbits
of
champion
gossip
â€“
just
for
you!
Dark
Child
Dental
Hygiene?
Many
champions
are
involved
in
product
endorsement.
From
Garen's
Brushwear
Boots
to
Taric's
Magic
Feather
Dusters,
the
most
popular
members
of
the
League
of
Legends
make
a
little
more
money
on
the
side
by
promoting
products
in
which
they
believe.
Personally,
this
reporter
sees
no
problem
with
such
behavior
â€“
in
fact,
I
use
many
of
the
products
that
our
favorite
heroes
endorse!
On
the
other
hand,
there
are
things
that
come
along
and
make
me
scratch
my
head
in
wonder.
Last
week,
the
infamous
Annie
toured
the
western
lands
of
Valoran
to
promote
the
launch
of
her
new
line
of
oral
care
products.
As
the
advertisement
says,
"The
world
has
many
places
of
dark
magic.
Don't
let
your
mouth
be
one
of
them."
This
is
accompanied
on
the
packaging
with
a
picture
of
both
Annie
and
Tibbers
holding
themed
toothbrushes
and
toothpaste
while
showing
their
pearly
whites.
Huh.
This
just
seems
so
warped
that
I'm
at
a
loss
for
words.
A
Cruel
Twist
of
Fate
As
this
reporter
shared
several
issues
ago,
the
relationship
of
the
blue-skinned
beauty
Evelynn
and
the
gypsy
rogue
Twisted
Fate
has
certainly
had
its
share
of
ups
and
downs.
On
Sunday,
it
hit
its
final
down.
What
started
out
being
a
romantic
couple's
walk
through
Granoa
Park
in
Demacia
went
cold
just
before
sundown.
Nearby
sources
claim
that
Evelynn
simply
dropped
the
bomb
in
the
middle
of
a
conversation,
leaving
Twisted
Fate
shocked
and
dismayed.
She
then
kissed
him
gently
on
the
neck
and
walked
into
the
growing
shadows.
Evelynn
has
so
far
been
unavailable
for
comment.
Rumors
abound
regarding
the
reason
for
the
break-up,
however.
Sources
close
to
the
Widowmaker
claim
that
this
was
a
perfectly
normal
break-up
for
Evelynn,
while
others
claim
that
there
is
some
lucky
soul
waiting
in
the
wings
for
her
affections.
The
truth,
as
always,
will
come
out.
This
reporter
managed
to
catch
up
with
Twisted
Fate
at
the
Accursed
Trinket,
a
disreputable
bar
in
Zaun.
While
it
seemed
that
Fate
was
open
to
the
idea
of
an
interview,
particularly
in
exchange
for
help
with
his
bar
tab,
the
champion
was
unable
to
form
coherent
sentences.
It
seems
that
this
reporter
caught
him
long
after
many
drinks
had
been
downed.
After
what
sounded
like
a
heartfelt
expression
of
loss
(although
he
could
have
just
as
easily
been
asking
for
help
to
the
bathroom),
he
passed
out,
fell
off
his
stool,
and
flatulated
loudly.
It's
this
reporter's
opinion
that
he
is
not
taking
the
break-up
well.
It
certainly
seems
that
the
Bachelormaker
has
struck
again!
More
as
this
develops.
Dear
Mr.
Steed
So
much
mail!
I
love
that
you
have
so
many
things
you
want
to
talk
to
Ram
Steed
about!
Far
less
hate
mail
than
I
was
expecting.
Putting
my
hand
randomly
in
the
mail
bag,
I
find
this...
"Dear
Mr.
Steed
â€“
Hello.
I
am
Dr.
Poulpe,
summoner
extraordinaire.
It
was
magic
to
read
your
article
this
morning
after
a
long
insomnia,
which
put
me
in
a
good
mood.
I
would
wish
to
know
if
any
of
the
ordinary
readers
of
your
publication
could
possibly
obtain
one
or
more
these
famous
images
concerning
our
poor
Janna
?
All
that,
of
course,
with
a
legal
aim."
--
Yours
sincerely,
Dr.
Poulpe
Thank
you,
Dr.
Poulpe.
It's
nice
to
know
that
my
little
column
was
capable
of
being
a
bright
ray
of
sunshine
into
your
life.
As
an
occasional
sufferer
of
insomnia
myself,
I
feel
your
pain.
As
to
your
request,
I
find
myself
wanting
to
ask
one
question.
What
legal
aim
could
you
have
for
acquiring
the
bedroom
images
of
Janna?
She
didn't
break
any
laws.
The
only
consequences
she
has
to
face
are
from
the
League
of
Legends,
and
they
have
full
access
to
the
images
in
question.
I
can
only
assume
that
you
are
looking
to
acquire
said
images
of
Janna
for
personal
reasons,
and
I
cannot
condone
participating
in
that
scheme.
This
reporter
is
a
lot
of
things,
but
I
am
not
someone
who
will
be
a
part
of
something
like
this.
So,
Dr.
Poulpe,
good
luck
with
your
legal
aims,
and
let
your
imagination
be
your
guide!
Thanks
for
writing
in.
If
you've
got
something
to
say
to
Ram
Steed,
mail
me
at
the
Journal.
Some
infernal
techmaturgical
machine
will
get
your
message
and
pass
it
on
to
me.
The
Mailbag
of
Justice
Reader
mail
from
all
across
Valoran
â€“
answered!
Senior
Summoner
Ralston
Farnsley
commenting
from
the
Institute
of
War
Couriers
from
all
across
Valoran
have
brought
your
questions
here
to
the
Institute
of
War.
We've
recently
had
a
few
questions
related
to
the
origins
and
motivations
of
champions.
Of
particular
interest
were
those
champions
who
once
made
their
homes
on
other
worlds.
An
intriguing
topic
indeed,
friends,
and
today
we'll
do
our
best
to
shed
some
light
on
these
enigmatic
visitors.
"So
if
certain
characters
in
the
League
hate
each
other,
then
why
do
they
work
together
as
a
team
in
combat?
Take
Kayle
and
Morgana
for
example.
Wasn't
Kayle's
existence
in
the
league
to
ultimately
kill
Morgana?
Why
do
I
occasionally
see
those
sisters
making
a
great
lane
partner
together
if
they
want
to
kill
each
other?
Why
isn't
there
a
debuff
placed
on
characters
with
grudges?
Is
it
because
they're
getting
paid
so
much
to
not
even
care
or
what?"
--
Moar
RQ
Champions
wishing
to
join
the
League
are
scrutinized
with
utmost
care
for
their
motivations
and
ambitions.
One
of
the
toughest
requirements
for
potential
champions
is
that
they
must
surrender
their
right
to
refuse
the
call
of
a
summoner
for
any
reason.
In
the
cases
of
Kayle
and
Morgana,
they
were
willing
to
temporarily
put
aside
their
grudge
to
join
the
League,
though
summoners
often
comment
on
being
mentally
affected
by
the
seething
anger
between
these
two
when
they
are
forced
to
fight
on
the
same
side.
Though
we
cannot
alter
the
feelings
of
the
champions
we
recruit,
it
is
my
suspicion
that
certain
fighters
take
advantage
of
the
situation
by
honing
their
skills
on
the
battlefield.
Although
there
is
certainly
the
danger
that
a
champion
will
wreak
havoc
after
gaining
immense
strength
during
their
experiences
on
the
Fields
of
Justice,
it
is
a
risk
the
League
is
willing
to
take.
"I
cannot
help
but
notice
that
all
new
additions
to
the
League
seem
to
be
'applying'.
Does
the
League
have
enough
champions
that
it
no
longer
need
to
pluck
the
unwilling
and
unsuspecting
(such
as
Anivia
,
Morgana
and
Kayle)
or
is
there
another
reason
for
the
League
to
stop
snatching
champions
off
their
homeworlds?"
--
Akkasha
A
most
intriguing
question,
summoner.
When
the
League
was
still
young,
its
numbers
were
fewer,
and
support
from
the
city-states
was
tenuous.
While
some
champions
recognized
our
authority
early
on,
many
still
believed
that
the
League
of
Legends
would
not
stand
the
test
of
time,
and
that
strife
would
soon
return.
During
this
time,
it
was
extremely
important
that
the
League
not
take
a
heavy-handed
approach
towards
the
city-states
by
forcing
their
most
cherished
heroes
to
compete.
Summoners
were
forced
to
be
more
creative
when
locating
champions
to
summon,
often
scouring
the
cosmos
for
one
that
suited
their
needs
on
the
Field
of
Justice.
It
was
only
after
Morgana
was
summoned
to
Valoran,
(and
subsequently
pursued
by
her
sister
Kayle)
that
we
began
to
realize
the
potential
consequences
of
such
actions.
Plucking
such
a
powerful
being
from
its
rightful
place
can
have
potentially
dire
consequences.
As
a
result,
the
summoning
of
beings
from
other
worlds
is
now
a
practice
strictly
regulated
by
the
League,
requiring
the
direct
approval
of
the
High
Council
of
Equity
before
it
can
be
attempted.
"I
would
like
to
address
Rammus
with
this
question.
Rammus
and
Twitch
intrigue
me
as
lesser
lifeforms
that
have
become
sentient.
I
was
wondering
if
either
of
them
have
have
discussed
their
sentience
with
each
other
and
what
their
thoughts
concerning
one
another
are."
--
Shillelagh
Rammus
is
an
Armordillo
of
few
words,
so
perhaps
I
can
answer
on
his
behalf.
When
he
initially
joined
the
League,
Rammus
gravitated
towards
Twitch
as
a
similar
character.
Ultimately,
he
didn't
find
the
Plague
Rat
much
to
his
liking.
While
they
are
both
animals
that
have
become
sentient,
that
is
where
any
common
ground
ends.
Remember
that
Rammus
became
sentient
in
the
jungles
of
Kumungu,
while
Twitch
is
a
byproduct
of
the
sewers
of
Zaun.
Twitch's
cruel,
urban
attitude
displeased
the
Armordillo.
More
surprising
is
the
fact
that
Rammus
and
Blitzcrank
found
that
they
had
more
in
common
than
one
might
think.
While
he
may
be
a
machine,
Blitzcrank
is
another
unique
creation
struggling
to
find
his
place
in
the
world.
Unlike
the
Plague
Rat
of
Zaun,
he
shares
a
benevolent
spirit
with
his
armored
companion.
