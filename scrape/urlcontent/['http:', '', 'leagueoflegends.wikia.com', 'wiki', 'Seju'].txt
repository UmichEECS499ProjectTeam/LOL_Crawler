Details

is
a
point
blank
auto-targeted
ability.
Applies
spell
effects
as
an
area
of
effect
ability.
Spell
vamp
is
reduced
to
one-third

Additional
Information:
The
Frost
debuff
itself
is
not
a
form
of
CC
and
hence
cannot
be
cleansed
by
items
or
abilities
that
remove
CC.
Permafrost,
however,
is
CC
and
can
be
removed.
Frost
cannot
be
applied
to
any
target
affected
by
Permafrost
until
3
seconds
after
the
Permafrost
debuff

Due
to
this,
Permafrost
is
the
only
of
Sejuani's
abilities
that
do
not
apply
Frost.
