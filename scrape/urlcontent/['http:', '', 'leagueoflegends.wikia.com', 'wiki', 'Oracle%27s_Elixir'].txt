Oracle's
Elixir
was
a
consumable
item
in
League
of
Legends
.
It
gave
the
consumer
and
its
allies
sight
of
stealthed
units
within
600
range
including:
champions
,
wards
,
and
other
stealthed
units.
Oracle's
Elixir
would
still
not
allow
you
to
see
within
brush
unless
you
enter
the
brush.
When
a
champion
consumed
Oracle's
Elixir
,
they
were
given
a
buff
and
a
particle
of
a
pink
eye
appeared
above
the
champion.

Notes
If
an
Oracle's
Elixir
is
bought
while
the
inventory
is
full,
it
will
be
automatically
consumed.
Oracle's
Elixir
is
replaced
by
Oracle's
Extract
in
the
game
type
Dominion
,

Grounds
,
although
they
have
the
exact
same
effect

Lunar
Revel
celebration.

was
the
same
item
with
a
different
