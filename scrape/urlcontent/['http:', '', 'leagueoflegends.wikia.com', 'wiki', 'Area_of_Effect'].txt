Area
of
Effect
(or
AoE
)
is
a
term
used
in
many
role-playing
and
strategy
games
to
describe
attacks
or
spells
that
can
affect
multiple
targets
within
a
specified
area
*
.
Spell
vamp
and
the
slow
from
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
have
reduced
effects
when
used
with
AoE
abilities.
Types
of
AoE
There
exist
champion
abilities
,
summoner
spells
,
and
some
items
in
the
game
that
grant
with
varied
Areas
of
Effect:
Chain
The
term
"chain
AoE"
refers
to
abilities
that
start
their
effect
with
a
single
target,
but
if
there
is
another
valid
target
within
the
range
of
the
chain,
the
effect
will
jump
to
that
target.
This
type
of
ability
usually
bounces
only
a
limited
number
of
times
and
cannot
hit
the
same
target
twice.
There
are,
however,
exceptions:
Dark
Wind
,
Pyroclasm
and
Spell
Flux
can
hit
the
same
target
more
than
once.
Malefic
Visions
can
jump
an
unlimited
amount
of
times,
provided
there
is
a
target
nearby
after
the
current
one
dies.
Chain
of
Corruption
will
damage
and
root
any
champion
nearby
the
orginal
target.
Some
of
the
abilities
of
this
type
also
have
a
decreased
damage
per
bounce,
like
Bouncing
Blades
.
Double
Up
,
inversely,
deals
increased
damage
on
the
second
(and
last)
target.
Cone
Cone
AoE
affects
a
conic
area
that
starts
at
the
feet
of
the
caster.
All
valid
targets
in
the
cone
receive
the
same
damage.
Examples:
Annie's
Incinerate
Miss
Fortune's
Bullet
Time
Mordekaiser's
Siphon
of
Destruction
Nidalee's
Swipe
Rumble's
Flamespitter
Corki's
Gatling
Gun
Ground
targeted
With
"ground
targeted
area
of
effect"
("GTAoE")
abilities
and
spells,
the
player
places
a
circle
on
the
ground
that
will
be
the
area
of
the
effect.
One
carefully
places
this
around
the
targets
and
clicks
to
start
casting/channeling.
All
units
that
are
in
that
area
or
remain
in
that
area
for
channeled
or
over-time
GTAoEs
suffer
the
damage
and/or
effects.
Examples:
Clairvoyance
Akali's
Twilight
Shroud
Brand's
Pillar
of
Flame
Cho'Gath's
Rupture
Galio's
Resolute
Smite
Gangplank's
Cannon
Barrage
Gragas's
Explosive
Cask
Jarvan
IV's
Demacian
Standard
Lux's
Lucent
Singularity
Miss
Fortune's
Make
It
Rain
Morgana's
Tormented
Soil
Nasus's
Spirit
Fire
Swain's
Nevermove
Trundle's
Frozen
Domain
Veigar's
Dark
Matter
Line
Line-based
AoE
abilities
are
the
most
varied
but
have
1
thing
in
common:
they
only
work
between
point
A
to
point
B.
Examples:
Anivia's
Flash
Frost
*
Galio's
Righteous
Gust
Leona's
Zenith
Blade
Lux's
Final
Spark
Malzahar's
Call
of
the
Void
Sona's
Crescendo
Point
blank
For
passive
point
blank
effects,
see
Aura
.
Some
AoE
effects
are
cast
or
used
without
having
to
target
someone
or
something;
the
caster
is
the
anchor
for
the
spell.
The
effect/damage
radiates
outward
from
the
caster
up
to
a
given
range,
affecting
all
targets,
or
the
first
given
number
of
targets,
within
the
radius.
These
types
of
effects
are
referred
to
as
"PBAoE",
which
stands
for
"point
blank
area
of
effect".
Some
examples:
Heal
Tiamat
&
Ravenous
Hydra
Randuin's
Omen
Talisman
of
Ascension
Amumu's
Curse
of
the
Sad
Mummy
Blitzcrank's
Static
Field
Darius's
Decimate
Galio's
Idol
of
Durand
Katarina's
Death
Lotus
Malphite's
Ground
Slam
Morgana's
Soul
Shackles
Nasus's
Fury
of
the
Sands
Nunu's
Absolute
Zero
Singed's
Poison
Trail
Vladimir's
Sanguine
Pool
Single
targeted
(Splash)
This
type
requires
at
least
1
target
to
trigger,
and
the
AoE
is
placed
in
an
area
around
the
target.
The
primary
target
is
not
always
affected.
Examples:
Tiamat
&
Ravenous
Hydra
Ashe's
Enchanted
Crystal
Arrow
Kayle's
Righteous
Fury
Karma's
Inspire
with
Mantra
Mordekaiser's
Creeping
Death
Tristana's
Buster
Shot
Zilean's
Time
Bomb
Xin
Zhao's
Audacious
Charge
Hybrid
Given
the
sheer
amount
of
abilities,
some
are
bound
to
include
more
than
1
type
of
AoE.
This
is
where
a
"hybrid"
classification
comes
into
play.
