Background

&
Trivia
Skill
Usage
Jayce
has
a
great
variety
of
abilities
at
his
disposal.
Judicious
use
of
different
combinations
grants
him
excellent
flexibility,
able
to
adjust
for
most
situations.
If
you
are
in
your
Mercury
Hammer
form
and
need
to
quickly
relocate,
you
can
use
your
transform
into
the
Mercury
Cannon
,
giving
you
extra
movement
speed
thanks
to
your
passive
and
then
immediately
placing
Acceleration
Gate
will
give
you
a
further
significant
speed
boost.
Additionally,
casting
Acceleration
Gate
,
passing
through
it
and
then
firing
Shock
Blast
back
through
it
will
likely
deal
considerable
damage
to
your
pursuer,
forcing
him
back
or
allowing
you
to
finish
him
off
with
Hyper
Charge
and
To
the
Skies!
combo.
Also,
when
firing
Shock
Blast
through
an
Acceleration
Gate
,
the
range
and
damage
on
the
Shock
Blast
is
greatly
increased
allowing
for
high
poking
potential
in
the
laning
phase.
Placing
Jayce
within
the
Acceleration
Gate
and
casting
Shock
Blast
won't
tip
off
the
enemy
of
the
exact
line
you'll
be
firing
on
as
much
since
the
projectile
of
Shock
Blast
will
be
instantly
speed
up,
giving
them
less
time
to
better
react.
As
well,
casting
Shock
Blast
and
then
placing
Acceleration
Gate
in
its
path
can
allow
it
to
hit
an
enemy
that
wrongly
assumes
they
can
out-run
the
ability.
If
you
are
being
poked
under
your
tower,
quickly
casting
To
the
Skies!
on
a
group
of
minions
will
clear
them
and
damage
your
opponent.
While
they
are
slowed,
you
can
use
Thundering
Blow
to
knock
them
back
into
tower
range
for
a
potential
surprise
kill.
If
jungling
and
a
tower
is
being
pushed,
you
can
combo
Acceleration
Gate
and
Shock
Blast
to
quickly
clear
a
group
of
minions
and
then
Thundering
Blow
the
enemy
champion
into
the
tower
and
finish
with
To
the
Skies!
Changing
forms
introduces
an
entirely
new
set
of
abilities
that
do
not
share
the
same
cooldown
timer
with
the
other
set
of
abilities.
Changing
forms
twice
will
not
cause
an
ability
to
go
off
cooldown
any
sooner.
Hyper
Charge's
attack
damage
and
attack
speed
boost
can
affect
attacks
dealt
by
the
hammer
.
Combine
this
with
the
magic
damage
from
the
switch
and
the
leap
from
To
the
Skies!
and
finish
with
Thundering
Blow
to
deal
a
quick
and
powerful
combo.
The
magic
damage
from
the
switch
also
affects
structures.
Combined
with
the
huge
attack
speed
boost
from
his
Hyper
Charge
,
this
can
also
take
down
towers
very
quickly.
Hyper
Charge
can
be
used
to
destroy
enemy
Wards
before
they
disappear
after
they
are
placed.
Shock
Blast's
explosion
can
reveal
the
Fog
of
War
and
grant
vision
in
brush
for
a
small
period.
Thundering
Blow
has
the
capability
to
knock
enemies
over
thin
walls.
Lightning
Field
can
be
very
useful
when
trying
to
destroy
minion
waves
and
jungle
camps.
Lightning
Field's
passive
allows
easy
mana
recovery.
When
in
Hammer
Stance
,
To
the
Skies!
makes
an
excellent
gap
closer,
and
grants
the
opportunity
to
unload
deadly
ability
combinations.
Hextech
Capacitor's
ability
to
ignore
unit
collision
and
increased
movement
speed
can
allow
great
positioning
for
singling
out
particular
enemies,
especially
when
they
are
attempting
an
escape.
When
an
enemy
is
escaping,
use
Transform:
Mercury
Hammer
to
switch
to
Hammer
Stance
.
Then,
with
the
extra
movement
speed
and
the
ability
to
ignore
unit
collision,
move
through
the
enemy
until
you
are
located
in
front
of
them.
Then
use
Thundering
Blow
to
knock
them
back.
If
they
are
too
far
away
to
catch
with
the
movespeed
alone,
To
the
Skies!
can
be
used
as
a
gap
closer,
slowing
them
and
even
further
disrupting
an
attempted
escape.
Most
of
Jayce's
abilities
do
not
interrupt
movement
or
attack
animations.
Transform:
Mercury
Cannon
,
Transform:
Mercury
Hammer
,
Lightning
Field
,
placement
of
Acceleration
Gate
,
and
the
activation
of
Hyper
Charge
do
not
interrupt
movement.
It
is
to
be
kept
in
mind
that
Jayce's
Mercury
Cannon
has
a
much
faster
attack
animation
than
his
Mercury
Hammer
.
This
makes
last
hitting
minions
much
easier
to
accomplish
while
ranged
rather
than
as
melee.
As
Acceleration
Gate
will
also
speed
up
allies
in
addition
to
yourself,
casting
it
immediately
in
your
team's
path
can
help
greatly
when
making
a
unified
retreat
or
chase
attempt.
Even
though
Thundering
Blow
does
not
scale
off
a
target's
missing
health,
it
can
be
used
as
an
execute-style
ability.
Keep
your
eye
on
the
opponent's
health
and
cast
Thundering
Blow
when
they
have
reached
the
same
%
of
their
health
as
it
will
deal
for
a
safe
kill.
Acceleration
Gate
reveals
fog
of
war
at
either
end
of
the
gate,
use
this
to
help
set
up
jumps
on
minion
camps
in
the
jungle.
While
in
lane
if
against
a
melee
champion,
be
sure
to
continually
harass
them
while
in
your
Mercury
Cannon
form,
this
will
deny
their
minion
kills
and
help
give
you
more
lane
control.
Doing
this
will
inadvertently
push
up
your
lane
so
stay
at
a
distance
once
you've
pushed
up
to
a
tower
in
order
to
allow
for
an
easy
escape
from
a
gank.
If
you
know
your
enemy
laner
is
not
present,
switch
to
your
Mercury
Hammer
and
restore
mana.
Build
Usage
Jayce
can
successfully
be
built
as
an
AD
carry
or
tanky
AD
caster
depending
on
his
team's
needs.
The
AD
caster
build
largely
focuses
on
his
Mercury
Hammer
and
his
carry
build
revolves
around
use
of
his
Mercury
Cannon
,
though
both
builds
make
use
of
both
stances.
Playing
and
building
around
Mercury
Hammer
is
generally
easier
of
the
two
as
the
transition
from
ranged
to
melee
is
an
easier
and
less-risky
one
for
a
champion
that
has
built
significant
durability
items,
while
a
transition
from
melee
to
ranged
is
obviously
beneficial
for
chasing
down
targets
or
kiting
enemies
-
and
without
durability
items,
one
is
unlikely
to
live
long
enough
to
allow
a
good
transition
from
melee
to
ranged.
Jayce
synergizes
extremely
well
with
movement
speed
items
due
to
his
many
position-dependant
abilities.
Consider
taking
items
and
spells
such
as
Boots
of
Swiftness
,
Zeal
and
Ghost
.
Trinity
Force
is
an
extremely
useful
item
for
Jayce
regardless
of
his
build,
as
he
benefits
at
least
moderately
from
all
the
stats
it
provides.
He
can
proc
its
passive
effects
regularly
as
he
will
be
making
repeated
use
of
his
spells
and
autoattacks
in
combat.
Building
an
early
Sheen
transforms
Jayce
into
a
deadly
pusher;
his
Lightning
Field
and
Shock
Blast
make
farming
minion
waves
exceptionally
easy
and
the
Sheen
procs
from
his
Transform:
Mercury
Hammer
and
Hyper
Charge
will
do
heavy
damage
to
turrets
.
Stacking
attack
speed
on
Jayce
can
be
largely
redundant
as
he
already
has
a
powerful
attack
speed
steroid
in
the
form
of
his
Hyper
Charge
.
Focusing
instead
on
attack
damage
items
can
be
more
beneficial
on
him.
Because
of
the
passive
mana
recovery
on
his
Lightning
Field
,
Jayce
is
more
restricted
by
his
health
than
by
his
mana
in
the
laning
phase.
Building
some
early
health
regeneration
or
life
steal
with
items
such
as
a
Rejuvenation
Bead
or
Vampiric
Scepter
can
allow
Jayce
to
stay
in
a
lane
for
a
very
long
time,
provided
you
can
afford
to
push
the
lane
by
hitting
creeps.
Offensively,
most
of
Jayce's
damage
is
on
the
physical
side,
making
armor
penetration
items
such
as
The
Brutalizer
and
Last
Whisper
very
effective
on
him.
The
Black
Cleaver
is
a
very
strong
item
for
Jayce
when
combined
with
his
Hyper
Charge
and
Transform:
Mercury
Cannon
,
as
he
can
very
quickly
get
all
three
reduction
stacks
on
an
opponent
and
cut
a
very
significant
portion
of
their
armor
away.
Frozen
Mallet
combines
well
with
Jayce's
exceptional
chasing
abilities
by
slowing
the
opponent
and
making
it
extremely
difficult
to
escape
from
him.
It
also
grants
a
large
amount
of
health
,
letting
him
stay
in
a
fight
for
much
longer.
Cooldown
reduction
can
be
a
useful
stat
to
itemize
for
on
Jayce
because
of
the
utility
and
damage
his
spells
afford
him.
The
active
effect
of
Talisman
of
Ascension
stacks
well
with
the
team-wide
movement
speed
boost
his
Acceleration
Gate
gives,
allowing
Jayce
and
his
team
to
relocate
extremely
rapidly
in
an
emergency.
Another
great
CDR
item
on
Jayce
is
Iceborn
Gauntlet
.
Although
it
gives
only
10
AD
when
combined
with
Manamune
/
Muramana
,
its
AoE
synergizes
very
well
with
To
the
Skies!
which
gives
him
great
wave
clearing.
This
is
a
great
build
against
an
physical
damage
-heavy
team
as
it
gives
70
armor
.
Once
he
has
obtained
at
least
17%
cooldown
reduction,
Jayce
is
capable
of
permanently
maintaining
all
eight
stacks
of
Guinsoo's
Rageblade
outside
of
combat,
as
his
Transform:
Mercury
Hammer
and
Transform:
Mercury
Cannon
are
both
free
to
cast.
Against
a
magic
damage-heavy
team,
Jayce
can
opt
to
use
either
a
Maw
of
Malmortius
or
Wit's
End
as
sources
of
AD-focused
magic
resistance
.
A
Maw
of
Malmortius
arguably
benefits
him
more
because
of
Hyper
Charge's
attack
speed
steroid
and
superior
attack
damage
scaling,
but
by
the
same
token
Hyper
Charge
can
also
let
him
very
quickly
build
the
passive
stacks
on
Wit's
End
and
offers
higher
magic
resistance.
Infinity
Edge
is
an
extremely
powerful
item
on
Jayce
when
using
Hyper
Charge
at
max
rank,
as
the
enhanced
attacks
can
critically
strike
.
With
an
Infinity
Edge
critical
hits
will
deal
250%
of
his
damage,
and
with
a
max
ranked
Hyper
Charge
,
the
enhanced
attacks
stack
with
critical
strikes
multiplicatively.
This
can
ultimately
result
in
up
to
three
critical
hits
doing
325%
damage.
Manamune
is
a
great
item
on
Jayce.
An
early
Tear
of
the
Goddess
allows
for
longer
sustain
in
lane
and
the
toggle
from
Muramana
procs
on
Thundering
Blow
and
all
three
attacks
of
Hyper
Charge
.
Sword
of
the
Divine
in
combination
with
Infinity
Edge
can
greatly
increase
the
damage
of
Hyper
Charge
.
At
400
AD,
Hyper
Charge
would
then
deal
4000
damage.

Countering
Jayce
is
highly
vulnerable
to
ranged
harass
in
lane
due
to
his
short
autoattack
range
of
500
in
cannon
form
,
and
most
ranged
attackers
can
reliably
hit
him
without
fear
of
return
fire
and
Jayce
cannot
benefit
from
the
mana-gain-per-hit
passive
of
Lightning
Field
without
taking
ranged
harass
should
he
run
out
of
mana
while
in
cannon
form
.
Consider
good
poking
top
laners
such
as
Kayle
or
Kennen
to
take
advantage
of
this.
Although
his
poke
in
the
form
of
Shock
Blast
is
highly
damaging,
the
projectile
from
this
ability
is
slow
and
relatively
easy
to
dodge.
He
can
enhance
the
attack
using
his
Acceleration
Gate
,
but
this
makes
his
attack
telegraphed,
and
lets
you
possibly
enact
countermeasures
to
it.
You
can
also
simply
remain
behind
minions
to
block
the
shots.
However,
an
accelerated
Shock
Blast
has
an
AoE
effect
that
can
damage
you
through
a
line
of
minions.
Despite
his
good
mobility,
Jayce
only
has
one
hard
gap
closer
in
the
form
of
To
the
Skies!
.
Strong
slows
like
Nasus's
Wither
can
enormously
reduce
his
effectiveness
in
combat.
To
the
Skies!
,
even
though
it
is
a
targetted
ability,
does
not
actually
track
enemies
who
are
moving.
A
blink
or
dash
ability
used
while
he
is
in
flight
can
dodge
his
attack
and
avoid
his
slow.
You
should
try
to
save
these
escapes
for
when
he
is
about
to
use
it.
Most
of
Jayce's
damage
is
physical.
Buying
early
armor
can
help
in
mitigating
his
damage.
Stacking
health
against
Jayce
is
less
effective
as
his
Thundering
Blow
deals
a
large
amount
of
magic
damage
based
on
your
maximum
health.
When
on
the
run
from
Jayce
and
his
team,
you
can
attempt
unusual
juking
maneuvers
in
order
to
mess
up
his
attempts
to
use
Thundering
Blow
to
knock
you
back
towards
his
team.
You
may
need
different
strategies
to
deal
with
Jayce
depending
on
how
he
is
playing.
Jayce's
ability
to
disrupt
a
team
as
a
bruiser
relies
on
the
abilities
of
his
Transform:
Mercury
Hammer
and
he
must
be
in
close
range
to
do
this.
Knockback
abilities
like
Tristana's
Buster
Shot
and
Alistar's
Headbutt
can
quickly
remove
the
threat
he
poses
from
a
teamfight.
Carry
Jayce
can
put
out
considerable
damage
with
his
abilities
in
Transform:
Mercury
Cannon
form,
but
the
short
range
on
his
autoattacks
means
he
must
remain
close
to
the
front
of
a
battle
to
make
the
most
of
his
kit.
This
means
he
is
highly
vulnerable
to
attack
from
tanky
champions
such
as
Irelia
or
assassins
like
Akali
.
Even
better,
pulls
such
as
Blitzcrank's
Rocket
Grab
and
Nautilus's
Dredge
Line
when
pulled
off
can
yank
him
into
range
of
your
entire
team
and
quickly
burst
him
down
before
he
can
dish
out
significant
damage.
Jayce
can
use
To
the
Skies!
to
cross
walls
and
provide
a
surprise
attack.
Both
denying
him
vision
of
key
bushes
by
destroying
any
wards
placed
there
and
warding
yourself
to
keep
track
of
his
movements
will
prevent
him
from
abusing
this.
Since
Jayce
is
not
very
sustainable,
champions
such
as
Cho'Gath
,
AP
Nidalee
,
and
Dr.
Mundo
would
be
able
to
out-sustain
Jayce
if
they
keep
successfully
harassing
him.
Building
items
such
as
Chain
Vest
,
Philosopher's
Stone
and
starting
with
a
Cloth
Armor
and
5
Health
Potion
s
can
help
out-sustain
Jayce
.
