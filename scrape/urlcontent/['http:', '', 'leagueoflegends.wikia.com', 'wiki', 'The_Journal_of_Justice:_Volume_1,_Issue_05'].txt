Freljord
Ascends
to
City-State
Status,
Accepted
into
League
Ashe
and
Tryndamere
crowned
its
Queen
and
King
Quinton
Groat
reporting
from
Rakelstake,
Freljord
According
to
Freljord
tradition,
Queen
Ashe
crowns
Tryndamere
as
her
chosen
king.
High
Councilor
Vessaria
Kolminye
made
a
proclamation
this
morning
from
the
Luminary
Cloister
of
the
Institute
of
War
,
granting
sovereignty
to
Freljord
and
conferring
upon
it
all
the
rights
and
protections
afforded
to
city-states
that
are
members
of
the
League.
Previously,
the
region
of
Freljord
enjoyed
only
acknowledgment
of
its
borders
and
the
right
to
request
Sanctum
Calamitates
(a
petition
for
League
intervention
against
foreign
invasion
or
natural
disaster).
With
its
newfound
status,
Freljord
is
allotted
one
League
Assembly
chair.
Their
chosen
Emissary
is
entitled
to
reside
at
the
Institute
of
War
and
cast
votes
in
League
Assemblies
on
Freljord’s
behalf.
Freljord
may
also
appeal
to
the
League
for
general
arbitration
of
political
affairs.
Kolminye’s
declaration
makes
Freljord
the
eighth
city-state
affiliated
with
the
League.
Freljord
has
applied
for
membership
in
the
past.
Its
previous
appeal
was
denied
on
the
grounds
that
its
population
was
insufficient,
lacking
both
a
defined
governmental
structure
and
the
means
to
police
itself.
Ashe's
recent
ordainment
as
leader
of
Freljord's
two
united
tribes,
bolstered
by
the
might
and
numbers
of
Tryndamere's
barbarians,
was
enough
to
sway
the
opinion
of
the
Council
of
Equity.
Immediately
following
Kolminye's
address,
the
united
tribes
crowned
Ashe
the
Queen
of
Freljord.
Ashe
is
the
first
princess
to
ascend
to
the
throne
since
the
Three
Sisters
War
divided
the
people.
According
to
Freljordian
tradition,
the
Queen
selects
her
King,
and
Ashe
selected
Tryndamere,
solidifying
her
arrangement
with
the
barbarians.
On
the
topic
of
her
choice,
Ashe
had
this
to
say:
"My
actions
are
guided
by
the
needs
of
our
people,
and
not
by
romantic
notions.
Our
union
is
a
pledge
to
reinforce
our
commitment
to
this
alliance."
Ashe
had
one
more
surprise
in
store
for
the
people
of
Freljord:
she
appointed
League
Champion
Nunu
as
Freljord's
League
Emissary.
At
his
appointment,
she
vowed:
"The
city-state
of
Freljord
will
never
scorn
its
Yeti
brethren,
nor
any
of
its
citizens,
regardless
of
species,
tribe,
custom,
or
affiliation."
As
a
token
of
this
promise,
she
offered
Sejuani,
the
Winter’s
Claw
,
a
seat
on
Freljord’s
new
Royal
Advisory
Council.
Sejuani
emerged
from
reclusion
to
respond:
"Princess
Ashe
is
no
more
my
queen
than
are
the
traitors
who
put
her
there.
Anyone
unable
to
see
through
this
ruse
is
as
much
responsible
for
the
perversion
of
our
culture
as
Ashe."
Her
opinion
was
not
echoed
by
her
people,
as
hundreds
of
Winter’s
Claw
tribesmen
journeyed
to
Rakelstake
to
attend
Ashe’s
coronation.
We
spoke
with
one
anonymous
Winter’s
Claw
attendee,
who
said:
"I
never
thought
I’d
see
the
day
that
we
would
be
taken
seriously
on
Valoran
.
I
honestly
don’t
even
know
what
the
tribes
are
fighting
for
anymore."
Nunu
accepted
his
appointment
proudly,
and
the
largest
contingent
of
Yetis
ever
witnessed
by
humans
was
present
for
Ashe's
coronation.
Nunu
stated:
"Queen
Ashe
is
just
what
we’ve
been
looking
for;
she’s
got
the
full
support
of
me
and
the
Yetis,
and
we’re
good
support
to
have!"
Hordes
of
barbarians
also
migrated
to
their
new
home,
many
arriving
to
view
the
second
crowning
of
their
king.
Tryndamere
welcomed
his
people
with
open
arms
and
an
inspiring
declaration:
"Finally,
we
have
a
voice
in
this
land.
Finally,
we
can
be
seen
for
what
we
truly
are:
proud
and
noble
warriors.
Finally,
my
brothers...finally."
The
plan
for
the
unification
of
Freljord
that
Ashe
set
into
motion
now
seems
complete;
however,
she
still
faces
many
difficult
trials
ahead.
In
light
of
the
protections
that
the
League
has
now
extended
to
Freljord
(and
consequently
to
the
barbarians),
Noxus
issued
a
"stand
down"
order
to
troops
dispatched
to
their
Northern
Barbarian
Pacification
Campaign.
Katarina
herself
delivered
the
command,
closing
with
a
bold
challenge:
"Noxus
abides
by
the
rules
of
the
League,
for
we
are
truly
noble,
but
we
haven’t
forgotten
the
offenses
perpetrated
by
those
[barbarian]
swine.
If
the
new
Freljord’s
courage
matches
its
insolence,
I
can
be
found
on
behalf
of
Noxus
on
the
Fields
of
Justice...
waiting."
Going
Where
He
Pleases
Following
the
League’s
unstoppable
force,
Dr.
Mundo
Tom
Tarumca
reporting
from
Zaun
On
most
days,
you
would
find
a
hive
of
activity
on
the
streets
of
Zaun
.
Today,
however,
the
usual
hustle
and
flow
of
the
restless
city
is
strangely
silent.
On
most
days,
the
dark
and
seedy
alleys
would
be
overflowing
with
a
proud
people
willing
to
give
their
all
for
a
profit.
Today,
Zaunite
business
is
eerily
slow,
and
most
of
the
city’s
shopkeepers
are
content
with
their
relatively
meager
gains
as
the
midday
sun
passes
overhead.
Today
is
not
like
most
days.
The
peddlers
of
Zaunite
wares
know
where
the
people
are:
Vaskervon
Coliseum.
The
League
of
Legends
Visiopathic
Service
is
showing
a
key
battle
arena
fight
between
Zaun
and
Ionia
,
and
no
true
Zaunite
would
even
dream
of
missing
it.
Miles
away
from
Zaun,
Dr.
Mundo
takes
his
place
on
Summoner's
Rift
.
Watching
his
ungraceful
entrance
into
the
arena,
you
wouldn’t
have
guessed
that
an
entire
city-state
would
rest
its
fate
on
his
massive
shoulders.
The
hulking
behemoth
appears
unaware
of
the
day’s
high
stakes
as
he
hastily
grabs
his
favorite
shield
from
its
usual
spot.
Amid
protests
from
the
shopkeeper,
Dr.
Mundo
tosses
some
gold
coins
carelessly
behind
him
as
he
ambles
towards
the
front
lines
to
face
his
Ionian
counterparts.
Standing
at
the
head
of
his
team,
Dr.
Mundo
looks
impatient
as
he
waits
for
the
first
wave
of
minions
to
cross
his
path.
"Mundo
thinks
that
it’s
time
to
fight
Baron
."
Most
city-states
would
send
a
champion
back
for
a
second
Judgment
if
they
heard
such
nonsense,
but
in
Zaun
a
cacophonous
cheer
erupts
from
the
fans
instead
–
a
cheer
that
the
Zaun
faithful
hope
can
be
heard
by
all
of
the
"peaceniks"
back
in
Ionia.
There
will
certainly
be
no
love
lost
between
the
two
city-states
after
the
game,
as
League
rules
for
this
particular
match
dictates
that
the
loser
will
cede
control
of
a
resource
rich
portion
of
their
shared
maritime
border
to
the
winner.
Such
a
loss
would
be
an
unacceptable
blemish
on
the
relatively
long
reign
of
Chairman
Magnus
Dunderson,
Zaun’s
Chief
Executive.
No
Zaunite
with
a
beating
heart
could
tolerate
such
a
failure
from
their
leadership.
Something
about
Dr.
Mundo
has
captured
the
collective
hearts
of
a
notoriously
self-centered
city-state.
Even
the
children
of
Zaun
pay
homage
to
their
idol,
with
foaming
novelty
tongues
and
unsharpened
cleavers
waving
as
high
as
their
stubby
arms
can
reach.
Their
parents
brandish
the
real
steel
as
they
look
forward
to
a
newly
adopted
tradition
in
Zaun:
a
post-game
celebratory
feast.
It’s
easy
to
forget
that
the
celebrations
were
almost
cut
short
before
they
began.
Dr.
Mundo’s
acceptance
into
the
League
was
met
with
much
criticism,
as
he
was
found
to
be
in
possession
of
unchecked
adrenaline
shots
during
his
first
match
against
Piltover
.
Dissenters
made
a
strong
case
that
this
went
against
the
League’s
original
Elixir
and
Potions
Policy,
in
which
it
states
that
all
enhancing
substances
must
be
sealed
pre-match
and
contained
in
a
regulation
size
bottle
to
maintain
the
integrity
and
impartiality
of
the
Shopkeeper’s
Union.
Nevertheless,
the
adrenaline
shot’s
effects
were
later
reclassified
as
a
type
of
biological
aura,
as
it
was
determined
that
the
composition
of
the
shots
made
them
ineffective
for
anyone
but
Dr.
Mundo
due
to
his
unique
physiology.
When
initially
asked
for
a
comment
on
the
matter,
Dr.
Mundo
responded
only
with
grotesque
slurping
noises.
He
has
stood
by
this
statement
ever
since.
Despite
his
lack
of
communication
skills,
Dr.
Mundo
receives
high
praise
from
his
usual
Twisted
Treeline
teammates:
Warwick
and
Singed
.
It’s
no
secret
that
Dr.
Mundo
takes
the
brunt
of
the
beatings
for
his
team,
but
he
and
his
compatriots
have
so
far
been
rewarded
for
his
sacrifices
on
the
field.
Match
after
match,
Dr.
Mundo
has
charged
in
and
softened
the
enemy
opposition;
sometimes
he
goes
out
in
a
blaze
of
glory,
but
just
as
often
he
enables
Warwick
to
make
kills,
cementing
the
Blood
Hunter’s
reputation
as
one
of
the
deadliest
Twisted
Treeline
combatants
in
the
League.
A
few
brave
commentators
have
remarked
that
Warwick’s
recorded
kills
are
not
entirely
well
deserved,
as
most
of
the
credit
belongs
to
Dr.
Mundo.
While
those
who
sacrifice
themselves
are
not
an
uncommon
occurrence
in
Zaun,
it
is
rare
to
find
such
a
case
that
as
beloved
and
revered
as
Dr.
Mundo.
No
Zaunite
with
at
least
one
good
eye
could
doubt
that
now
is
the
time
for
Dr.
Mundo,
and
for
Zaun,
to
attain
a
League
championship.
Mundo
is
going
where
he
pleases,
and
the
rest
of
Zaun
is
right
behind
him.
[NEXT
TIME:
an
in-depth
interview
with
Dr.
Mundo!]
A
Shimmering
Future?
The
many
colors
of
Zaun’s
rebellious
youth
L.B.
Briskes
commenting
from
Zaun
Occasionally,
between
the
hysterical
tirades
and
fits
of
frantic
desk-pounding
which
invariably
accompany
my
reactions
to
the
everyday
behaviors
of
my
fellow
Valoranians,
I
recline
with
a
Rabble
Rouser
V.S.O.P.
–
I
am
a
self-respecting
cognoscenti
–
and
reflect
upon
the
days
of
my
youth.
In
the
few
instances
that
I
am
not
immediately
deterred
from
this
activity
by
unfortunate
recollections
owed
to
a
tardy
adolescence
and
an
unmerciful
complexion,
I
think,
"Gosh,
if
only
I’d
had
the
opportunity
to
smear
myself
with
corrosive
(but
shiny!)
techmaturgical
waste
before
departing
to
the
slums
to
display
my
delightfully
pre-atrophied
skin!"
I’m
sure
I’d
have
matured,
like
a
Kaladoun
sugar
raisin,
into
a
remarkably
sweet
–
albeit
shriveled
and
unidentifiable
–
version
of
the
optimist
you
all
know
me
to
be.
And
imagine
my
utter
dismay
when
considering
that
I
arrived
only
a
decade
too
late
for
the
latest
fad
sweeping
Zaun’s
precocious
youth.
Shimmer
–
as
the
kids
are
calling
it
–
is
manufactured
from
the
toxic
runoff
generated
by
the
factories
which
support
Zaun’s
continuing
explorations
into
sludge
refinement.
Apparently
when
slathered
on
the
skin
like
–
or
more
probably
instead
of
–
body
soap,
Shimmer
either
simulates
or
stimulates
intense
emotions
in
its
subject.
Boring,
you
say?
Well
what
if
I
told
you
that
it
also
sparkles,
glows,
and
"shimmers"
in
a
scintillating
array
of
colors?
Still
not
impressed?
Well
here’s
the
real
pitch:
the
emotions
this
phosphorescent
exfoliant
creates
correspond
with
the
assortment
of
colors
in
which
you
can
acquire
it.
So
you
can
literally
wear
your
dejected
or
whimsical
heart
in
expressive
patterned
designs
not
only
on
your
sleeve,
but
on
your
back,
legs,
forehead,
or
anywhere
else
you
haven’t
yet
withered
away.
Oh
right,
I
almost
forgot
to
mention,
frequent
application
of
this
caustic
glop
results
in
progressive
degeneration
of
the
skin
and
muscle
tissue.
Of
course,
Zaun
officials
are
quick
to
shirk
responsibility,
"All
industrial
byproducts
within
Zaun
are
scrutinized
for
public
health
and
environmental
hazards,
and
any
which
are
determined
to
have
unacceptably
harmful
effects
follow
strict
safe
disposal
procedures.
Those
who
synthesize
the
compound
referred
to
as
'Shimmer'
must
obtain
their
ingredients
through
unlawful
means."
They
have
declined
any
comment
regarding
rumors
that
Shimmer
was
the
failed
result
of
state-sponsored
attempts
to
create
a
bio-enhancing
agent
which
would
grant
its
wearer
unnatural
abilities,
a
rumor
which
has
only
increased
its
popularity.
All
criticism
aside,
this
is
one
reporter
wholly
in
favor
of
freedom
of
expression.
I
say
go
out
there
and
be
the
prettiest
little
raisin
you
can
be.
After
all,
what
concern
is
a
late
life
restrained
to
your
motorized
hextech
recliner,
wheeling
about
with
your
good
thumb
when
you
can
spend
your
ample
"downtime"
looking
back
on
a
childhood
during
which
you
shone
like
a
firefly
in
the
sickly
Zaun
moonlight
and
your
complexion,
unlike
mine,
offered
you
a
proud,
glittering
cocktail
of
emotions
you
enjoy
revisiting,
day
after
day,
from
the
standardized
comforts
of
your
nursing
ward?

Nasha-target?
When
last
we
left
the
Eye
Inside,
this
reporter
delivered
an
exclusive
exposé
on
the
budding
relationship
between
League
sweetheart
Nidalee
and
Journal
of
Justice
reporter
Bob
Nashahago.
Well,
that
little
article
sure
has
stirred
up
trouble
for
old
Bob!
Sources
close
to
Bob
have
said
that
the
number
of
threatening
letters
he’s
received
have
dramatically
increased.
The
subject?
Fan
jealousy
over
his
romantic
activities.
One
anonymous
source
from
within
the
Journal
of
Justice
headquarters
had
this
to
say:
“Nidalee
is
definitely
a
fan
favorite,
but
I
guess
no
one
realized
quite
to
what
extent.
Since
Steed's
article,
there
have
been
many
letters
from
fans
insulting
or
belittling
him.
Some
of
them
have
gone
so
far
as
to
vow
they
would
fight
him
if
they
ever
saw
him
in
person.”
This
journalist
has
uncovered
one
of
these
closely
guarded
letters
to
bring
to
you
exclusively!
Let
no
one
say
that
Ram
Steed
isn't
on
the
case!
"You
better
sleep
with
one
eye
open.
You're
dead!
You
hear
me!
DEAD!
Get
away
from
Nidalee!
She
is
MINE!
Summoner
Nacht.
That's
right,
that's
my
name.
Any
time,
anywhere.
No
summoning,
I'll
take
you
on
with
my
own
hands!"
--
Nacht
Only
time
will
tell
how
this
little
pickle
will
turn
out.
Good
luck,
Bob!
This
is
one
time
that
I'm
sure
we're
all
glad
that
you're
Bob
Nashahago
and
we're
not...well...except
for
your
envious
new
penpals.
The
Storm's
Bedroom
Listen
up
celebrities
–
once
you're
in
the
public
light,
there
is
no
such
thing
as
privacy
anymore!
This
is
a
lesson
that
Janna
is
learning
the
hard
way,
when
private
images
of
her
dressed
in
revealing
lingerie
spread
like
wildfire
through
the
fan
circles.
While
Janna
herself
has
withdrawn
from
the
public
eye
for
the
time
being,
no
doubt
mired
in
strategy
sessions
with
her
public
relations
people,
a
source
close
to
the
champion
claims
that
these
boudoir
images
were
captured
by
a
rumored
former
romantic
interest.
Whoops!
While
the
snooper
in
question
will
no
doubt
receive
his
just
deserts
(who
picks
a
fight
with
a
champion
of
the
League?!),
the
damage
has
been
done.
League
of
Legends
officials
have
voiced
their
displeasure.
Roan
Fallon,
head
of
public
relations
for
the
League,
had
this
to
say:
“Regardless
of
the
source,
Janna
is
a
representative
of
the
League
of
Legends.
She
should
comfort
herself
as
such
at
all
times.
We
are
still
deliberating
our
next
course
of
action.”
Sounds
like
trouble
for
Janna,
but
fear
not
Janna-fans,
she’s
been
in
the
eye
of
the
storm
before,
and
if
anyone
can
find
a
dignified
way
out,
it’s
her.
Hang
in
there,
Janna!
Until
Next
Time...
As
always,
yours
truly,
the
hardest
working
reporter
in
the
League,
will
labor
tirelessly
to
bring
you
–
the
hardcore
fan
–
more
of
what
you
really
want
to
read.

commenting
from
the
Institute
of
War
Our
mailbag
continues
to
overflow,
and
we
here
at
the
Journal
are
happy
to
take
a
moment
from
our
journalistic
pursuits
to
read
your
missives.
Thank
you
for
your
praise
and
enthusiasm,
and
please
keep
sharing
your
thoughts!
"I
was
excited
when
I
heard
about
Kalamanda's
potential
for
nexuses
and
even
more
when
I
found
out
Runeterra
might
be
regenerating
the
world
we
lost
in
the
rune
wars.
As
quite
the
science-y
person,
I
was
wondering
if
any
reporters
had
found
any
news
about
groups
or
persons
who
were
researching
the
revival
of
things
lost
during
the
rune
war
or
the
regeneration
of
Runeterra's
natural
magic."

Poruku
An
excellent
question,
Poruku.
We
have
correspondents
in
Kalamanda
who
are
keeping
apprised
of
the
events
surrounding
the
nexus
discoveries,
and
they
check
in
regularly
with
the
Arcanum
Majoris’
archaeological
teams.
Outside
Kalamanda,
many
of
the
magical
colleges
and
academies
commission
regular
archaeological
expeditions
all
over
Valoran.
The
Academy
of
Science
and
Progress
in
Piltover
,
founded
by
League
champion
Heimerdinger
,
contributes
a
hefty
portion
of
its
budget
to
the
Runeterran
Regeneration
Project.
Students
involved
with
the
project
are
challenged
to
find
creative
new
ways
to
optimize
the
efficiency
of
magic.
"I
was
particularly
delighted
with
your
article
on
the
return
of
Urgot
.
This
is
a
breakthrough
of
the
thus
far
mostly
theoretic
techmaturgical
art
of
corpsecrafting.
For
those
readers
unacquainted
with
the
term,
this
is
the
combination
of
hextech
and
necromancy.
I
would
be
much
pleased
if
you
would
follow
up
with
an
article
examining
the
techmaturgical
details
and
causes
of
this."
--
Munchlord,
Summoner
of
Zaun
We’re
glad
you
enjoyed
the
article,
Munchlord.
Specifics
surrounding
the
process
are
kept
highly
confidential,
particularly
to
those
who
are
in
the
business
of
reporting.
If
you
are
a
citizen
of
Zaun,
however,
you
may
be
able
to
contact
Professor
Pididly
himself
at
the
College
of
Techmaturgy;
he
seems
to
love
discussing
his
craft
with
his
fellow
Zaunites.
"I
fear
the
worst
will
come
about
should
conflict
arise
in
the
Freljord
between
League
Champion
Ashe
and
Princess
Sejuani.
The
presence
of
Tryndamere,
another
League
Champion,
is
both
a
blessing
and
a
curse
in
my
eyes.
The
presence
of
him
and
his
barbarians
will
certainly
deter
the
Princess
from
trying
to
ignite
any
sort
of
conflict
during
his
stay
with
her
forces
alone.
However,
should
the
Princess
request
the
help
of
Noxus,
the
barbarians'
enemies,
the
two
League
Champions
will
find
themselves
fighting
on
two
fronts."
--
The
Ninth
Priest
Many
people
share
your
concerns,
and
this
situation
is
not
being
taken
lightly.
Ashe
and
Tryndamere
have
experienced
lifetimes
of
struggle
and
they
understand
these
dangers
better
than
you
or
I
could
imagine.
While
I
am
no
politician,
I
think
the
potential
of
Sejuani
seeking
out
an
alliance
with
Noxus
is
a
very
real
possibility.
I
would
be
surprised
if
Ashe
and
Tryndamere
don’t
have
this
threat
in
mind
as
they
are
making
decisions
that
will
determine
the
fate
of
all
Freljordians.
While
there
are
many
paths
this
could
take,
the
people
of
Freljord
have
shown
hope
and
courage
which
has
been
stifled
for
generations,
and
Ashe’s
actions
made
it
possible.
We
share
your
hope
that
they
can
find
a
peaceful
resolution.
