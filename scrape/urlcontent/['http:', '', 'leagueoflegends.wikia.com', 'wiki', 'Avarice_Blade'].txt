Notes
Avarice
Blade
is
the
only
gold
-generating
item
without
the
Gold
Income
passive
,
meaning
it
can
be
purchased
alongside
other
gold
per
10
items.
However,
only
one
Avarice
Blade
can
be
held
at
a
time.
Avarice
Blade's
tooltip
states
the
total
gold
earned
with
the
item.
In
the
incredibly
unlikely
event
of
no
missed
last
hits
,
Avarice
Blade
becomes
gold
efficient
in
6
minutes
and
55
seconds
.
The
gold
gained
from
the
Greed
passive
stacks
with
other
on-kill
bonus
gold
abilities
and
auras
such
as
Ashe's
Hawkshot
,
Gangplank's
Parrrley
,
Twisted
Fate's
Loaded
Dice
and
the
+3
gold
from
controlling
one
altar
in
Twisted
Treeline
.
Trivia
The
item's
description,
"Greed
is
good",
could
be
related
to
the
Warcraft
III
cheat
code
for
extra
gold
and
lumber
"greedisgood".
Both
instances
are
based
on
the
quote
by
the
fictional
character
Gordon
Gekko
in
the
American
movie
Wall
Street
.
The
item's
image
appears
to
be
that
of
Long
Sword
,
with
the
addition
of
a
golden
glow.
