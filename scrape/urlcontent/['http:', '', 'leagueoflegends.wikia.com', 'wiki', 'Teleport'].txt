Teleport
Teleport
Effect
After
channeling
for
3.5
seconds,
your
champion
teleports
to
target
turret,
minion
or
ward.
Teleporting
to
an
allied
turret
puts
Teleport
on
a
200
second
cooldown
instead.
You
may
reactivate
Teleport
to
cancel
it,
placing
it
on
a
200
second
cooldown.
Cooldown
300
Range

Level

Example
Teleport
is
a
targeted
summoner
spell.
It
is
used
to
quickly
travel
from
one
location
to
a
friendly
turret,
minion
or
ward
anywhere
on
the
map.
It
is
not
stopped
like
Recall
upon
damage,
but
can
still
be
disrupted
by
hard
crowd
control
abilities
such
as
stuns,
roots,
and
silences.
Teleporting
to
an
allied
minion
or
ward
will
make
it
invulnerable
for
the
duration
of
the
channel.

Strategy
Teleport
is
great
for
ganking
if
the
enemy
commits
to
a
fight
and
is
around
friendly
minions
or
turrets.
Teleport
is
also
used
to
quickly
switch
lanes
to
defend
an
unguarded
tower.
Another
use
for
teleport
is
a
backdoor
maneuver
where
a
high
damage
per
second
champion
places
a
ward
inside
or
near
the
enemy
base
and
teleports
to
that
ward.
From
there
that
champion
will
attempt
to
bring
down
as
many
towers
and
inhibitors
as
possible.
Notes
This
article
is
outdated.
Please
update
this
article
to
reflect
recent
events
or
newly
available
information.
A
teleport
can
also
be
cancelled
by
the
caster
itself
by
activating
the
spell
again,
but
doing
so
will
put
the
spell
on
a
180
second
cooldown
(as
opposed
to
the
full
300
second
cooldown).
Teleport
renders
the
targeted
minion
invulnerable
for
the
duration
of
the
teleport
(when
targeting
a
minion).
It
is
possible
to
use
teleport
on
a
minion
targeted
by
an
enemy
tower
when
teleporting
to
assist
a
push,
preventing
tower
damage
for
those
4
seconds.
It
will
also
stop
the
minion
from
attacking
or
moving.
While
champions
could
use
crowd
control
abilities
to
move
the
targeted
minion,
the
teleporting
champion
will
still
arrive
at
the
original
position.
Stealthed
objects
targeted
by
the
spell
Teleport
will
be
destealthed
for
the
duration
of
the
teleport.
When
using
teleport
on
a
allied
tower,
the
tower
does
not
become
invulnerable,
although
it
can
still
attack.
Also,
if
the
tower
is
destroyed
as
you
are
channeling,
the
teleport
particle
will
vanish
and
your
teleport
will
be
canceled
with
the
full
cooldown.
While
standing
at
an
end
of
a
wall
or
other
standing
out
part
of
terrain,
using
Teleport
slightly
increases
vision
radius
just
around
the
corners
in
the
fog
of
war.
Turrets
cannot
be
teleported
to
within
the
first
10
seconds
of
a
game.
Teleport
will
be
cancelled
by
the
caster
becoming
stunned,
rooted,
silenced,
feared,
or
taunted.
Targets
In
addition
to
any
friendly
minion
or
turret,
Teleport
can
be
used
on
a
number
of
allied
structures
and
creatures.
These
include:
Wards
like
Sight
Ward
and
Vision
Ward
will
be
revealed
to
enemies
for
a
few
seconds.
Jarvan
IV's
Demacian
Standard
.
Thresh's
Dark
Passage
.
Destructible
traps
like
Shaco's
Jack
In
The
Box
and
Teemo's
Noxious
Trap
.
They
do
not
become
invulnerable,
but
if
they
are
destroyed
during
the
teleport,
the
champion
will
still
arrive
at
their
original
position.
Pets
like
Annie's
Summon:

,

Omen

and

plants
(and
even
her
seeds)
and
Elise's
spiderlings
can
also
be
teleported
to.
Zac's
bloblets
that
form
upon
death
from
Cell
Division
.
However,
Teleport
does
not
work
on:
Indestructible
traps
like
Nidalee's
Bushwhack
and
Caitlyn's
Yordle
Snap
Trap
.
Champion
copies
like
Mordekaiser's
Children
of
the
Grave
and
Shaco's
