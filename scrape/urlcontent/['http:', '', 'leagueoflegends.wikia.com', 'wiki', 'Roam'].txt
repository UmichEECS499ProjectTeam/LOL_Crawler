Redirected
from
Roam
Roaming
is
a
rare
style
of
gameplay
in
which
your
champion
spends
the
"laning
phase"
of
the
game
roaming
across
the
map
rather
than
spending
it
laning
or
jungling
.
Roamers
are
generally
champions
with
high
base
stats,
are
not
dependent
on
farming/items,
set
up
ganks
well
and/or
gank
well
themselves.
Roamers
often
focus
on
ganking
lanes,
clearing
wards,
counter
jungling
or
even
killing
the
enemy
jungler.
Having
a
roamer
allows
each
teammate
their
own
lane,
giving
them
a
level
advantage.
With
a
jungler,
there
will
be
three
solo
lanes.
If
your
team
contains
a
roamer
your
team
should
have
a
champion
that
can
hold
their
own
against
two
champions
by
themselves,
or
roaming
can
become
a
liability
rather
than
an
asset.
Many
of
the
concepts
of
roaming
have
become
an
integral
part
of
some
junglers,
including
Riven
and
Maokai
.
Rather
than
farming
the
jungle,
some
junglers
are
more
suited
to
counter
jungling
and
roaming.

Strategy
Ganking
early
can
grant
your
team
kills
while
jungles
are
still
clearing
camps
(most
people
don't
expect
a
gank
in
the
first
or
second
wave
of
minions)
Counter-jungling
can
help
against
gold
and
experience
problems
by
clearing
enemy
neutral
monster
camps
or
scoring
a
kill
against
the
enemy
jungler.
Distracting
the
enemy
jungler
by
preventing
him
from
farming
can
greatly
benefit
teammates.
Early
gold
and
experience
problems
can
also
be
mitigated
by
killing
Dragon
with
your
team's
jungler
or
invading
at
the
begining
of
the
game.
Roamers
can
help
give
your
team
map
awareness
at
beginning
of
the
game.
Sweeping
Lens
is
an
important
item
on
roamers
as
it
allows
them
to
counter
enemy
warding,
and
make
ganking
easier.
This
can
also
assist
your
team's
jungler
by
increasing
their
chance
of
a
successful
gank.
Roamers
should
often
set
up
their
runes
and
masteries
to
focus
on
sustain,
movement
speed,
gold
income
and
experience.
Inspiration
is
an
essential
mastery
to
combat
underleveling.
All
gold
masteries
should
be
present
in
roamers
as
gold
is
one
of
the
biggest
threats
to
roamers.
Culinary
Master
can
be
a
useful
mastery
to
help
sustain,
allowing
for
more
ganks.
Roamers
should
coordinate
ganks
with
their
team's
jungler,
in
order
to
improve
efficiency.
This
may
include
ganking
straight
after
a
previous
gank,
to
surprise
the
enemy.
Roamers
should
continue
to
gank
lanes
while
the
jungler
is
farming,
in
order
to
keep
up
pressure.
Roamers
can
also
help
protect
the
jungler
from
counter-ganking.
Due
to
spending
most
of
their
time
outside
of
a
lane
and,
therefore,
away
from
gold,
experience
and
enemies,
Roamers
make
good
use
out
of
items
which
provide
benefits
when
out
of
combat
such
as:
Health
and
Mana
Regeneration
(to
recover
between
encounters)
Gold
generation
(to
make
up
for
their
lack
of
gold
and
experience
from
minions)
Ancient
Coin
granting
mana
regeneration,
health
regeneration
and
gold
income
while
in
lane.
Spellthief's
Edge
is
more
useful
for
roamers
who
spend
less
time
in
lane,
or
focus
on
fighting
the
enemy
jungler.
Relic
Shield
is
sometimes
useful
for
roamers
that
tax
lanes
and
it
also
grants
a
small
healing
effect.
High
movement
speed
(to
decrease
time
outside
of
lanes
and
to
help
facilitate
ganks)
Boots
of
Mobility
or
Boots
of
Swiftness
.
It
is
often
worthwhile
to
get
Alacrity
or
Homeguard
.
Sightstone
and
Sweeping
Lens
for
increased
map
control.
CC
items
to
improve
ganks
Iceborn
Gauntlet
grants
a
slow
and
deals
more
damage,
scaling
with
base
stats.
Support
items
like
Aegis
of
the
Legion
can
improve
the
roamers
effect
on
teamfights.
Countering
Roamers
If
your
team
does
not
have
a
roamer,
your
team
will
have
at
least
one
2v1
lane,
allowing
this
lane
to
focus
on
zoning
and
harassment.
Early
warding
and
map
vision
can
cripple
a
roamer
since
good
map
awareness
can
deny
a
roamer
any
successful
ganks.
Similarly,
good
map
awareness
from
spells
like
Hawkshot
or
Clairvoyance
can
drastically
reduce
the
success
rate
of
a
roamer.
This
can
also
be
achieved
with
abilities
like
Teemo's
Noxious
Trap
.

Roaming
champions
befit
greatly
from
high
base
stats
and
being
less
dependent
on
items.
Champions
with
CC
abilities
have
stronger
ganks
and
champions
with
high
sustain
and
movement
speed
also
make
for
good
roamers.
The
following
are
some
examples
of
roaming
champions:

an
advantage
against
their

enemy.
Not

item
dependent.

Champions
that
can
hold
a
1v2
Lane
When
using
a
roamer
in
place
of
a
bottom
duo
lane,
it
is
important
to
have
a
champion
that
can
hold
their
lane
without
much
difficulty.
Generally,
these
champions
are
bruisers
that
modify
their
build
for
easy
sustain
and
wave
clears.
A
jungler/roamer
can
then
gank
when
they
have
the
advantage
of
levels.

Trivia
/
Notes
Roaming
was
once
a
popular
strategy
in
high
ELO
games
during
season
one.
Oracle's
Elixir
was
a
popular
buy
on
roamers
before
season
four.
Season
four
changes
to
gold
income
items
have
made
it
increasingly
difficult
for
roamers.
