Alliance
in
Freljord
League
champions
unite
against
the
threat
of
war
Quinton
Groat
reporting
from
Rakelstake,
Freljord
League
Champions
Ashe
and
Tryndamere
announce
their
alliance
in
Rakelstake,
Freljord.
An
announcement
made
this
afternoon
by
Princess
Ashe,
the
Frost
Archer
,
has
left
all
of
Freljord
anxiously
abuzz,
as
she
has
accepted
Tryndamere
's
offer
to
join
forces
with
the
barbarians.
Two
weeks
ago,
Tryndamere,
the
Barbarian
King,
arrived
in
the
region
to
pay
respects
to
Mauvole,
the
deceased
princess
of
the
Ice
Dervish
tribe.
He
and
Ashe
met
afterward
for
reasons
unknown.
There
was
speculation
that
he
and
his
clan
arrived
to
deter
Princess
Sejuani
from
taking
any
aggressive
action,
as
she
had
retreated
to
isolation
in
what
many
feared
was
preparation
for
war.
Tryndamere's
visit
was
not
an
entirely
selfless
venture,
but
rather
for
the
negotiation
of
a
mutually
beneficial
opportunity.
Ashe
elaborated
on
the
matter
in
her
speech:
"We
stand
at
the
threshold
of
a
momentous
occasion
for
our
people.
After
generations
of
conflict,
two
of
our
illustrious
tribes
have
united
under
a
single
banner,
reconciling
differences
that
date
back
to
the
Time
of
the
Three
Sisters.
While
we
desire
nothing
more
than
to
discover
common
ground
upon
which
our
third
sister-tribe
will
ally
with
us,
a
matter
of
greater
urgency
has
arisen.
Tryndamere,
the
Barbarian
King,
arrived
recently
to
request
sanctuary
for
his
people
within
the
boundaries
of
Freljord.
They
seek
refuge
from
Noxian
forces
which
even
now
encroach
on
our
doorstep,
claiming
that
they
do
so
only
as
part
of
their
'Barbarian
Pacification
Campaign.'
I
am
too
aware
of
the
imperialist
Noxian
mentality
to
be
fooled
by
such
hollow
justifications."
"Though
our
relations
with
the
nomadic
barbarian
tribes
have
often
been
tenuous,
this
is
the
time
to
relinquish
old
grudges.
This
is
the
time
for
us
to
assert
our
place
in
Valoran.
As
the
leader
of
the
Frost
Archer
and
Ice
Dervish
tribes,
I
have
chosen
to
grant
Tryndamere
and
all
barbarians
asylum
within
our
lands.
I
ask
you
to
welcome
them
as
your
own.
Tryndamere
has,
in
turn,
offered
his
appreciable
barbarian
army
to
defend
and
assist
our
tribes
against
any
enemy,
be
they
foreign
or
domestic.
Together,
we
will
steer
the
path
of
Freljord,
sure
as
the
mountains
guide
the
glacier,
to
its
rightful
place
alongside
the
mightiest
civilizations
of
Runeterra."
Her
speech
was
met
with
resounding
support
by
the
members
of
her
two
tribes.
The
formidable
barbarian
forces
will
make
any
violent
response
from
the
Winter's
Claw
risky
at
best,
as
their
numbers
dwarf
those
of
all
three
tribes
combined.
Sejuani,
Princess
of
the
Winter's
Claw,
could
not
be
reached
for
comment.
The
League
representative
for
Noxus
also
declined
to
comment,
promising
that
an
official
response
was
coming
soon.
For
the
people
of
the
Freljord,
this
is
a
daring
move,
as
they
have
remained
cautiously
neutral
with
regard
to
foreign
affairs
in
the
past.
When
questioned
about
her
bold
stance,
Ashe
had
only
this
to
say:
"This
is
only
the
beginning."
Mogron
Pass
Security
Garrison
Assaulted
Unknown
bandits
south
of
the
Great
Barrier
attack
League
security
post
Bob
Nashahago
reporting
from
Mogron
Pass
A
League
security
garrison
within
Mogron
Pass
is
reporting
that
it
was
attacked
by
what
are
assumed
to
be
bandits
coming
from
south
of
the
Great
Barrier.
The
attack
occurred
two
days
ago
during
a
late
night
watch
of
the
mountainous
corridor
that
separates
the
northern,
civilized
half
of
Valoran
from
the
mostly
unexplored
and
dangerous
southern
half.
Though
the
garrison
successfully
repelled
the
attack,
the
report
indicates
one
defender
was
killed
and
three
others
injured
in
the
nighttime
assault.
While
the
report
also
states
that
a
number
of
the
attackers
were
slain,
no
bodies
were
recovered
after
the
assault.
The
motive
behind
the
assault
remains
a
mystery;
the
manner
of
the
attack,
however,
is
not.
Unidentified
hooded
humanoids
in
light
armor
wielding
short
blades,
some
using
obfuscation
magic,
launched
a
surprise
frontal
assault
on
the
garrison.
League
forces
immediately
responded
to
the
threat
thanks
mainly
to
the
efforts
of
the
slain
soldier,
Corporal
Alfonse
B.
Flavin,
as
his
early
warning
of
the
attack
provided
the
defenders
time
to
prepare.
The
defenders
reported
seeing
a
small
number
of
attackers
making
their
way
north
past
the
garrison
in
the
heat
of
battle.
Upon
seeing
this,
the
garrison
readied
itself
for
a
potential
flanking
maneuver,
but
none
ever
came.
The
assailants
took
heavy
casualties
as
the
element
of
surprise
quickly
wore
off
and
the
garrison
vigorously
defended
its
strategic
position.
The
attackers
were
forced
to
retreat,
but
successfully
pulled
all
of
their
casualties
off
the
battlefield.
While
assaults
by
bandits
or
other
malfeasants
are
not
uncommon
around
Mogron
Pass,
especially
south
of
the
Great
Barrier,
the
attack
on
a
League
garrison
is
a
first
since
the
League
began
positioning
security
garrisons
along
the
Pass.
Captain
Barlo
Warrax,
commander
of
the
League
security
outpost,
commented
on
the
brazenness
of
the
attack.
"We’ve
dealt
with
a
number
of
lowlifes
who
prey
on
people
traveling
through
the
Pass,
but
this
is
the
first
time
that
these
scumbags
have
dared
to
challenge
us
within
our
own
garrison.
Well,
we
showed
them
who
was
in
charge
of
Mogron
Pass."
Warrax
went
on
to
explain
the
current
situation
along
Mogron
Pass
as
troublesome.
"Ever
since
this
Kalamanda
thing
blew
up,
we’ve
seen
all
sorts
of
idiots
marching
down
through
here
thinking
that
going
south
of
the
Great
Barrier
is
a
fun
hike.
Well,
it
ain’t!
There’s
a
reason
all
these
merchant
caravans
have
an
armed
escort
with
them.
It’s
because
it’s
dangerous!"
Warrax
strongly
advised
caution
for
amateur
explorers
planning
on
venturing
south
of
the
Great
Barrier.
"Don’t
be
a
moron.
Stay
home.
We’re
a
well-armed
military
force,
and
we
lost
a
good
soldier
defending
ourselves.
How
well
do
you
think
you’ll
do?
Will
there
even
be
enough
left
to
identify
you
when
these
heathens
are
done
with
you?"
The
League
has
promised
to
immediately
reinforce
the
garrison
with
troops
currently
stationed
in
Kalamanda
as
part
of
an
ongoing
research
project.
Furthermore,
the
League
issued
a
general
statement
advising
the
people
of
Valoran
to
exercise
good
judgment
if
traveling
south
of
the
Great
Barrier.
The
Magic
Within
Song
Sona’s
Ionian
debut
stuns
audience
Reira
Kashuld
reporting
from
the
Serene
Garden,
Ionia
It
doesn’t
take
a
connoisseur
of
music
to
truly
appreciate
the
night
I
recently
experienced
underneath
the
Great
Tree
within
Ionia
's
Serene
Garden.
Still,
it
can
be
hard
to
grasp
just
how
a
single
person
can
charm
an
entire
crowd
without
saying
a
single
word!
It
was
a
full
house
within
the
Serene
Garden
Amphitheater
for
yesterday’s
performance
by
the
gifted
Demacian
musical
prodigy
known
as
Sona
–
one
that
ended
with
an
accordant
standing
ovation.
Sona
performed
six
of
her
most
acclaimed
arias,
and
she
delighted
the
crowd
with
an
encore,
debuting
an
unexpected
seventh.
This
breathtaking
piece,
"The
Aria
of
Perseverance
",
inspired
feelings
of
spiritual
resilience,
challenging
us,
her
captive
audience,
to
overcome
the
struggles
in
our
lives
and
rise
above
our
self-imposed
limitations.
For
Ionians,
the
uplifting
chorus
felt
as
though
the
music
was
compelling
us
to
reach
out
and
touch
enlightenment
itself...
even
if
only
for
a
moment.
Each
composition
painted
its
own
story.
Every
chord
struck
and
every
string
plucked
drew
me
in
to
the
music.
I
could
understand
and
feel
every
note.
For
those
who
haven’t
been
following
Sona,
she
is
the
rising
star
of
Demacia’s
music
scene.
She
has
gained
quite
a
following
throughout
the
world
ever
since
her
royal
command
performance
last
year
during
Demacia’s
"Lightshield
Music
Concert
Series".
Even
obtaining
a
ticket
to
one
of
her
concerts
is
a
quest.
An
amazing
fact
about
the
young
musician
–
she
is
completely
mute!
That
is
virtually
irrelevant,
as
her
music
gives
her
a
voice
few
could
ever
dream
of.
You
don’t
have
to
take
my
word
for
it;
you
can
see
Sona
yourself...
if
you
can
scrape
together
enough
coin
for
the
scalpers.
But
that’s
a
small
price
to
pay
for
a
lifetime
memory,
not
to
mention
a
taste
of
enlightenment,
isn't
it?
Champions:
Inside
and
Outside
the
League
A
behind-the-scenes
look
at
the
lives
of
the
League’s
champions
Bob
Nashahago
reporting
from
the
Institute
of
War
Believe
it
or
not,
your
favorite
champions
have
lives
outside
of
the
Fields
of
Justice!
You
would
be
surprised
at
what
some
of
Valoran's
most
famous
heroes
do
in
their
off-hours.
That's
what
this
new
recurring
feature
of
the
Journal
of
Justice
will
profile:
the
lives
of
the
League's
finest
once
they
leave
the
battle
arenas.
All
of
our
staff
will
be
contributing
over
the
coming
months
as
we
profile
each
and
every
League
champion!
Morgana,
the
Fallen...
Baker?
When
Morgana
,
the
League's
otherworldly
winged
witch,
isn't
causing
havoc
in
the
Fields
of
Justice,
she
leads
quite
a
different
life.
Morgana
trades
her
spells
for
a
stirring
spoon
while
serving
as
both
the
proprietor
and
master
baker
at
Sinful
Succulence,
her
always-busy
bakery
located
in
the
heart
of
Noxus
’
merchant
district.
Morgana's
magical
muffins
are
all
the
rage,
with
orders
coming
in
from
as
far
away
as
Demacia
.
"I've
spent
a
great
deal
of
time
refining
the
recipes
I
remember
from
my
homeland,
as
well
as
mastering
the
ones
I’ve
learned
here,"
Morgana
said
while
displaying
her
latest
culinary
masterpiece:
Isomalt’s
Peccable
Pecan
Pie.
"While
I
may
be
focused
on
freeing
my
people
from
the
tyranny
wrought
by
the
likes
of
my
[expletive]
sister,
Kayle
...
there's
always
room
for
pie,"
Morgana
added.
While
Sinful
Succulence
only
has
a
single
storefront
in
Noxus,
the
success
Morgana's
bakery
has
enjoyed
is
allowing
her
to
expand.
Two
new
bakeries
are
planned
for
Zaun
and
the
Institute
of
War
,
both
of
which
are
scheduled
to
open
at
the
beginning
of
next
year.
The
next
time
you’re
in
Noxus,
make
sure
to
stop
by
and
grab
yourself
a
tasty
treat!
Flames
for
Your
Wagon
The
city-state
of
Piltover
is
the
leading
center
of
ecologically-minded
techmaturgical
and
magical
research
in
Valoran.
If
you
are
looking
for
the
latest
crazy
gadget
to
give
your
ride
that
extra
get-up-and-go
(that
won’t
shatter
the
planet
into
a
billion
bits
in
the
process),
then
look
no
further
than
Piltover
Customs.
The
proprietor
and
chief
mechanic
of
the
most
successful
transportation
customization
and
modification
enterprise
in
the
City
of
Progress
is
none
other
than
Corki,
the
Daring
Bombardier
.
"In
between
my
time
in
the
League
and
my
duties
with
the
Screaming
Yipsnakes,
I
like
to
mess
around
under
the
hood
of
all
sorts
of
vehicles!",
Corki
explained
as
he
gave
a
special
tour
of
the
workshop
he
and
his
crew
of
technicians
use
to
make
some
of
the
most
radical
conversions
you’ve
ever
seen.
"Most
of
the
mods
we
do
are
for
caravan
wagons
–
adding
armor
plates
or
creating
slits
for
archers
inside
the
wagon.
Every
once
in
a
while,
we’ll
get
to
work
on
an
order
for
some
really
over-the-top
stuff
–
state
of
the
art
hextech.
That’s
where
the
real
fun
is!"
For
Corki’s
tougher
assignments,
he
will
often
turn
to
his
comrade-in-arms
Heimerdinger,
the
Revered
Inventor
.
A
number
of
their
more
interesting
contraptions
are
on
permanent
display
in
the
Yordle
Academy
of
Science
&
Progress,
which
is
located
in
Piltover.
A
trip
to
the
City
of
Progress
is
not
worth
talking
about
unless
you
spend
some
time
checking
out
the
latest
gizmos
that
Corki
and
company
have
put
together.
The
Yordle
Academy
of
Science
&
Progress
will
grant
tours
nearly
every
day
of
the
week,
while
Piltover
Customs
will
provide
tours
by
special
request
only.

questions!
Senior
Summoner
Ralston
Farnsley
commenting
from
the
Institute
of
War
Letters
from
all
across
Valoran
keep
pouring
in,
and
the
Journal
of
Justice
prospers
as
a
result.
Again,
we
thank
our
readers
and
patrons
for
their
kind
words.
One
particular
piece
of
feedback
I
found
interesting
was
the
idea
of
featuring
more
athletic-oriented
articles
on
the
events
inside
the
Fields
of
Justice.
I
couldn’t
agree
more;
not
only
do
the
battle
arenas
serve
us
in
a
geopolitical
sense,
but
they
also
make
for
rousing
entertainment!
I
believe
we
have
found
one
of
the
most
knowledgeable
and
respected
individuals
when
it
comes
to
the
analysis
of
battle
arena
performance
to
write
for
the
Journal.
You
shall
see
his
debut
article
in
an
upcoming
issue
of
the
Journal.
Now
–
on
to
the
mail!
"I
would
like
this
[question]
to
be
forwarded
to
Tryndamere:
where
did
you
get
your
sword?
I
am
assuming
that
you
built
it
with
your
own
bare
hands,
but
perhaps
it
was
a
gift.
Did
someone
give
that
sword
to
you
because
it
was
too
dangerous
to
go
alone?"
--
2xHero
Tryndamere
was
kind
enough
to
oblige
with
a
reply:
"My
late
father
gave
me
the
sword
I
now
wield.
My
father’s
father
gave
it
to
him,
as
did
his
father
before
him.
As
a
boy,
I
was
curious
about
the
sword,
much
as
you
are
now.
I
remember
his
words
well:
‘Master
using
it
and
you
can
have
this.’
Mastering
it
requires
more
than
just
physical
strength:
strength
of
mind
and
strength
of
character
are
also
needed.
I
must
exercise
all
three,
especially
now
in
these
trying
times."
"Do
you
think
anti-yordle
sentiment
exists
in
Noxus?
I
for
my
part
can't
see
any
reason
for
expelling
the
yordles."
--
Zedek
I
often
think
there’s
anti-everyone-except-Noxus
sentiment
in
Noxus.
The
nefarious
city-state
prides
service
and
loyalty
in
its
subjects.
While
I
think
Noxians
naturally
gravitate
toward
each
other,
I
don’t
think
they
care
the
shape
or
size
of
the
individual
giving
them
what
they
seek.
They
worship
power
above
everything
else,
and
those
who
are
able
to
acquire
it
above
anyone
else.
They’re
a
natural
foil
for
the
"justice-at-any-cost"
Demacians.
Their
rivalry
has
really
shaped
the
direction
of
Valoran
for
the
past
150
years,
and
to
a
certain
extent
helped
bring
about
the
creation
of
the
League
(despite
their
best
efforts
otherwise).
"What
is
so
legendary
about
Icathia
?
Why
do
so
many
explorers
go
there,
risking
their
lives?"
--
Delong
I
would
guess
the
pursuit
of
knowledge
drives
most
explorers
south
of
the
Great
Barrier,
and
the
pursuit
of
fabled
riches
drives
the
rest.
Of
all
the
lands
in
southern
Valoran,
however,
Icathia
is
one
we
know
virtually
nothing
about.
The
past
five
Rune
Wars
did
much
to
destroy
whatever
civilization
existed
there
before
our
current
enlightened
age.
Other
than
fanciful
tales
that
are
likely
the
product
of
a
bard
drinking
copious
amounts
of
wine,
we
really
do
not
have
any
credible
historical
facts
to
work
with.
Any
scholar
of
note
will
tell
you
that
our
historical
records
are
woefully
inadequate.
With
League
champions
such
as
Cho'Gath
,
Kog'Maw
,
and
Malzahar
claiming
to
originate
from
Icathia,
we
are
forced
to
face
our
true
lack
of
knowledge.
I
do
know
one
thing
–
when
three
beings
exist
in
the
League
from
a
place
we
know
nothing
about,
we
had
better
start
learning
about
it
as
quickly
as
possible.
