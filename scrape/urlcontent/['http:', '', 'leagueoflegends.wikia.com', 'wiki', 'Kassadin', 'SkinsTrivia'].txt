Trivia
Adam
Harrington
in
League
of
Legends
(00:38)
Adam
Harrington
as
Kassadin
Kassadin
was
designed
by
Ezreal
.
The
icon
of
Kassadin's
Null
Sphere
is
the
same
used
for
Baron
Nashor
's
buff
.
Kassadin
is
one
of
five
champions
voiced
by
Adam
Harrington,
the
other
four
being
Karthus
,
Mordekaiser
,
Ryze
,
and
Shaco
.
Kassadin
is
somewhat
similar
to
the
Helghasts
from
the
Killzone
series.
Skins
Kassadin's
Festival
skin
was
released
during
the
2010
Winter
Olympics
.
Kassadin's
Deep
One
skin
is
a
reference
to
the
Deep
Ones
,
frog-like
beings
who
live
underwater
in
the
Cthulhu
Mythos
.
Deep
One
Kassadin
is
based
on
a
creation
of
Ser
Gregor
.
Pre-Void
Kassadin's
robe
appears
slightly
purple
in
the
artwork,
but
it
is
actually
brown
in
game.
This
is
due
to
a
lighting
effect
added
to
display
a
glow
from
the
void
entity
in
the
artwork.
Harbinger
Kassadin
represents
a
corrupted
Kassadin,
having
fallen
to
the
void
and
serving
a
similar
purpose
to
Malzahar
.
Malzahar
has
been
trying
to
convince
Kassadin
to
join
him
several
times,
this
skin
seems
to
take
place
should
he
accept.
Relations
Kassadin's
quest
to
protect
Valoran
from
the
Void
gives
him
a
deep
enmity
towards
Voidborns
and
Void-influenced
beings,
such
as
Cho'Gath
,
Kog'Maw
,
Kha'Zix
and
Malzahar
.
According
to
the
Journal
of
Justice
,
Kassadin
is
rumored
to
have
followers
called
"The
Preservers
of
Valoran".
They
seek
to
stop
the
impending
invasion
by
the
creatures
of
the
Void.
As
such,
they
are
at
odds
with
Malzahar's
group,
"The
Cult
of
the
Void,"
who
seek
to
unleash
the
Voidborn
onto
Valoran.
Zaunite
officials
speculate
that
Kassadin's
daughter
was
captured
by
Malzahar
for
a
sacrificial
ritual.
She
is
now
trapped
within
the
Void.
Kassadin
and
Malzahar
engaged
in
combat
in
the
mountains
outside
of
the
Institute
of
War
and
were
eventually
stopped
by
League
Adjudicators.
Karthus
was
also
present
at
the
scene,
though
for
unknown
reasons.
He
stated
that
he
was
"protecting
the
inhibitor,"
referring
to
something
other
than
the
inhibitors
on
the
Fields
of
Justice
.
