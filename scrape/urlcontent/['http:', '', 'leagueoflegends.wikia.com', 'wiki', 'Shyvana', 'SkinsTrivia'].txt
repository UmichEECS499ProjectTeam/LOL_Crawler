Trivia
Shyvana
was
designed
by
Coronach
.
[1]
Shyvana
is
voiced
by
Karen
Strassman
,
Who
also
voices
Cassiopeia
,
Fiora
,
Zyra
,
and
Elise
.
Shyvana's
ultimate,
Dragon's
Descent
,
is
the
only
non-toggle
champion
ability
in
the
game
that
is
not
cooldown
based.
Shyvana's
dance
is
from
the
music
video
RIVER
by
the
Japanese
idol
group
AKB48
.
A
side-by-side
comparison
of
the
dance
can
be
seen
here
.
Shyvana's
lore
was
changed
after
release,
removing
references
to
being
attacked
by
a
mob
and
instead
having
Jarvan
IV
save
her
from
the
wrath
of
the
dragons.
This
change
was
done
because
it
was
felt
that
the
original
lore
did
not
make
it
sensible
for
her
to
join
Demacia.
Her
lore
was
changed
once
more
to
have
Shyvana
simply
team
up
with
Jarvan
IV
on
the
similar
goal
of
slaying
the
dragon
that
killed
Shyvana's
father.
Shyvana
was
the
first
champion
since
Kog'Maw
to
not
receive
a
League
Judgement.
With
the
exception
of
Varus
,
no
other
champion
since
then
has
received
a
Judgement
either.
Shyvana's
rage
system
was
mislabeled
as
"Dragon's
Blood"
on
her
mechanics
preview.
Shyvana
is
the
third
champion
to
feature
a
physical
transformation
ability,
the
others
being
Nidalee
and
Swain
released
before
her,
and
Zyra
and
Elise
released
after
her.
Shyvana's
transformation
might
look
like
a
wyvern,
because
dragons
are
supposed
to
have
4
legs
and
2
wings,
while
wyverns
only
have
2
legs
and
2
wings.
However,
wyverns
are
supposed
to
be
unable
to
breathe
fire
like
dragons
do,
effectively
turning
Shyvana
into
a
half-dragon.
Quotes
Shyvana's
quote,
"The
quiet
before
battle."
,
is
similar
to
the
popular
idiom
"The
calm
before
the
storm."
Shyvana's
quote,
"On
wings
of
fury."
,
is
similar
to
Vayne's
quote,
"On
wings
of
night."
Skins
Ironscale
Shyvana
is
a
reference
to
the
scale
armour
worn
by
warriors
of
different
cultures.
Scale
armor
is
often
associated
with
dragons
in
various
fantasy
genres.
This
is
most
likely
due
to
how
the
individual
metal
scales
are
overlapped
with
each
other,
resembling
the
fictional
scales
of
a
dragon.
The
dragon
form
of
the
Ice
Drake
Shyvana
skin
bears
a
resemblance
to
Kyurem
from
the
Pokémon
franchise.
Ice
Drake
Shyvana
is
a
community
requested
skin,
fan
named
Whiteout
Shyvana
,
the
original
Whiteout
Shyvana
however,
was
more
focused
on
the
white
colors
than
on
the
actual
cold
theme
that
Ice
Drake
Shyvana
has.
The
original
thread
can
be
found
here
.
Relations
Moved
by
Shyvana's
plight,
Jarvan
IV
assisted
her
in
slaying
the
mighty
dragon
that
killed
her
father.
After
the
battle,
Jarvan
IV
offered
Shyvana
a
place
as
a
noble
warrior
in
the
ranks
of
the
Demacian
Elite
Guard.
Out
of
gratitude
and
necessity,
Shyvana
accepted.
Garen
views
Shyvana
with
disapproval
due
to
her
lack
of
discipline
and
self-control.
Among
Demacians,
Shyvana
gets
along
with
Xin
Zhao
best,
after
Jarvan.
[2]
Shyvana
is
curious
and
(probably)
envious
of
Nidalee
's
freedom
and
her
balance
between
her
human
and
animal
forms,
and
doesn't
understand
Ahri
's
desire
to
become
fully
human.
Shyvana
hates
being
turned
into
a
squirrel
by
Lulu
.
Shyvana
sees
Twitch
and
Zyra
as
no
more
than
a
snack
and
something
to
burn,
respectively.
[3]
Galio
is
a
friend
of
Shyvana's
and
it
is
implied
that
his
wisdom
has
a
calming
effect
on
her
rage.
