Dominion
was
officially
announced
on
the
main
website
as
the
new
capture-and-hold
game
mode
on
League
of
Legends
on
Thursday,
August
4,
2011.
Even
though
there
was
no
information
about
this
new
mode
before
the
announcemnt
there
was
a
large
build-up
for
it
on
the
Kalamanda
storyline
on
the
Journal
of
Justice
Issues.
During
the
development
cycle,
the
mode
was
code-named
Odin

Initial
Announcement
The
League
of
Legends
community
had
no
idea
that
such
new
map
was
being
developed
until
the
official
announcement.
However,
its
gameplay
had
been
leaked
the
day
before
the
announcement
on
the
forums,
and
they
had
to
be
shut
down
as
the
news
continued
to
spread.
The
official
announcement
was
accompanied
by
a
video
trailer
and
they
are
both
here:

Summoners!
Many
of
you
may
have
been
wondering
out
loud
just
what
we
have
in
store
for
the
future.
Today
we
are
pleased
to
give
you
your
first
look
at
League
of
Legends:
Dominion,
the
largest
game
update
in
the
history
of
League
of
Legends.
This
update
will
feature
not
only
a
brand
new
map,
but
also
an
entirely
new
game
mode
showcasing
innovative
gameplay
never
before
attempted
in
the
MOBA
genre.
For
quite
some
time,
all
of
you
have
been
clamoring
for
new
battlefields
upon
which
to
test
your
skills
against
other
summoners
in
League
of
Legends.
We're
pleased
to
announce
that
we've
heard
you,
and
that
for
over
a
year
our
Design
Team
has
been
working
tirelessly
to
craft
Dominion
into
a
truly
new
and
groundbreaking
experience.
On
the
Crystal
Scar
players
will
battle
for
control
of
five
capture
points,
holding
them
to
damage
their
enemies'
nexus.
The
game
ends
when
one
team
had
seized
control
long
enough
to
drain
the
opposing
team's
nexus
down
to
zero.
Battles
last
around
20
minutes,
and
focus
on
high-intensity,
player-versus-player
combat.
If
you've
been
looking
for
a
fast-paced,
high-intensity
competitive
gaming
experience,
this
is
what
you've
been
waiting
for.
We're
taking
Dominion
on
the
road
during
convention
season
this
year,
allowing
you
to
get
your
hands
on
the
new
game
mode
at
both
Gamescom
in
Cologne,
Germany
and
PAX
Prime
in
Seattle,
Washington!
Stay
tuned
for
more
details
as
we
draw
closer
to
these
exciting
events.
As
there
was
no
information
on
how
soon
the
mode
would
be
available
for
the
general
public,
the
same
post
was
updated
with
the
following
information:
Some
of
you
have
expressed
interest
in
when
Dominion
will
be
available
worldwide,
and
we
wanted
to
respond
to
that
directly.
While
we
take
a
“when
it’s
ready”
approach
to
our
feature
releases,
you
will
be
able
to
play
Dominion
in
a
nearly
complete
state
at
GamesCom
(August
17-21)
in
Europe
and
at
PAX
Prime
(August
26-28)
in
North
America.
League
of
Legends:
Dominion
will
make
it
into
your
daily
play
schedule
shortly
after
PAX.
Keep
an
eye
out
on
our
website
over
the
month
of
August
for
more
information,
video
documentaries,
trailers,
live
streams
and
gameplay
previews.
Further
Announcements
During
the
following
days,
Riot
Games
released
more
information
and
a
new
website
rearding
the
new
mode.
Dominion
Gameplay
The
following
statement
and
video
were
releaed
on
August
8.
League
of
Legends
Dominion
Gameplay:
The
Legend
Evolves
Summoners!
With
League
of
Legends:
Dominion
just
on
the
horizon,
the
goal
was
to
really
push
League
of
Legends
gameplay
to
the
next
level,
providing
a
truly
new
and
innovative
experience
for
you.
Whether
you're
a
brand
new
summoner
still
leveling
up
or
a
grizzled
veteran
taking
to
the
Field
for
yet
another
battle,
we
wanted
League
of
Legends:
Dominion
to
feel
drastically
different
than
our
classic
gameplay
while
still
capturing
those
same
elements
that
make
League
of
Legends
fun
and
exciting
to
play.
Focused
on
a
capture
and
hold
style
of
gameplay,
League
of
Legends:
Dominion
promises
short
and
intense
game
sessions
filled
with
action-packed,
back-and-forth
battles.
Unlike
the
more
measured,
strategic
pace
of
classic
gameplay,
the
frantic
pace
of
this
new
game
mode
promises
non-stop
player
vs.
player
combat
as
small
groups
of
champions
vie
for
control
of
dynamic
map
objectives
that
promise
a
whole
new
layer
of
team
play
and
coordination.
Matches
are
designed
to
be
competitive
right
down
to
the
bitter
end,
with
late
game
comebacks
serving
as
one
of
the
hallmarks
of
this
thrilling
new
game
mode.
Here's
a
behind-the-scenes
look
into
the
design
process
of
League
of
Legends:
Dominion.
Watch
as
members
of
our
design
team,
and
more
of
your
favorite
Riot
personalities,
explain
their
goals
and
objectives
when
constructing
this
exciting
new
game
mode!

Summoners!
We've
put
a
lot
of
hard
work
into
developing
our
upcoming
game
mode
-
League
of
Legends:
Dominion
.
Our
artists
and
sound
designers
have
gone
to
the
well
to
bring
you
a
Field
of
Justice
that
really
captures
the
fast-paced,
dynamic
gameplay
of
our
new
capture-and-hold
game
mode.
Unlike
the
mirrored
design
of
Summoner's
Rift,
Crystal
Scar
features
five
capture
points
for
players
to
capture
and
control,
each
with
its
own
unique
landmarks
and
style.
We've
also
taken
the
overall
environment
detail
to
the
next
level,
helping
to
create
a
greater
sense
of
depth
than
we've
ever
attempted
in
the
past.
Combined
with
ambitious
new
particles,
animations
and
brand
new
music
that
changes
based
on
how
your
team
is
performing
against
your
opponents,
Crystal
Scar
is
sure
to
provide
a
compelling
new
setting
for
the
fast-paced,
visceral
combat
in
store
for
this
coming
update
to
League
of
Legends.
Here's
an
inside
look
at
the
construction
of
this
brand
new
Field
of
Justice,
and
be
sure
to
listen
close
for
a
sneak
peek
at
the
new
music.
Watch
as
some
of
Riot's
gifted
artists
verbally
illustrate
what
goes
into
building
a
new
battlefield
for
the
League
of
Legends:
Dominion
game
mode!
