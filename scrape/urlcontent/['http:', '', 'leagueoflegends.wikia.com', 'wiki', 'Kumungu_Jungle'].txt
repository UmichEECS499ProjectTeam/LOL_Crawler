Lore
There
are
few
dwellers,
let
alone
champions,
residing
in
the
blasted
and
dangerous
lands
that
lie
south
of
the
Great
Barrier.
Much
of
that
world
still
bears
the
scars
of
past
Rune
Wars,
especially
the
mysterious
Kumungu
Jungle.
There
are
long-forgotten
treasures
in
these
strange
places
which
many
risk
life
and
limb
to
acquire.
Nidalee,
the
Bestial
Huntress
The
Bestial
Huntress
Nidalee
was
only
a
young
girl
traveling
with
her
treasure-seeking
parents
when
they
lost
their
way
in
the
dense,
rainy
jungles.
The
jungle
was
unforgiving,
and
she
watched
her
parents
suffer
agonizing
final
days
as
they
fell
victim
to
a
mysterious
and
vicious
disease.
As
improbable
as
it
was
for
a
child
to
survive
in
the
inhospitable
jungle
by
herself,
she
did
just
that.
Her
youthful
innocence
and
a
fortunate
naivete
caused
her
to
appeal
to
the
beasts
of
that
place
and
she
was
taken
in
by
a
family
of
cougars
and
raised
as
one
of
their
own.
She
grew
and
somehow
absorbed
the
raw
magic
of
the
dense
wilds,
evolving
beyond
both
her
human
physiology
and
her
feline
affectation.
On
one
pivotal
day
in
her
life,
standing
over
the
torn
remnants
of
a
Noxian
squad
of
woodcutters,
Nidalee
chose
to
rejoin
the
so-called
civilized
world,
to
fight
in
the
League
of
Legends
so
as
to
protect
the
vast
woods
from
both
Demacia
and
Noxus.
Zyra,
Rise
of
the
Thorns
The
Rise
of
the
Thorns
Centuries
ago,
Zyra
and
her
kind
dominated
the
Kumungu,
using
thorns
and
vines
to
consume
any
animal
that
set
foot
in
their
territory.
As
the
years
passed,
much
of
the
animal
population
steadily
died
off.
Food
became
increasingly
scarce,
and
Zyra
could
only
stand
by
helplessly
as
the
last
of
her
kind
withered
away.
She
thought
she
would
perish
alone,
until
the
appearance
of
an
unwary
sorceress
presented
her
with
an
opportunity
for
salvation.
It
was
the
first
time
in
years
Zyra
had
sensed
a
creature
wander
so
close.
Hunger
drew
her
to
the
sorceress,
but
some
other,
deeper
instinct
compelled
her.
She
enveloped
the
woman
in
thorns
with
ease,
but
as
she
savored
this
final
meal,
foreign
memories
invaded
her
thoughts.
She
saw
great
jungles
of
metal
and
stone
where
humans
and
animals
thrived.
Potent
magic
surged
through
her
vines,
and
she
devised
an
elegant
but
risky
plan
to
survive.
Using
the
woman’s
memories,
Zyra
poured
her
newfound
magic
into
the
creation
of
a
human-shaped
vessel.
When
Zyra
opened
her
eyes,
she
was
overwhelmed
by
the
raw
power
ready
at
her
fingertips.
It
wasn’t
until
she
noticed
the
shriveled
remains
of
the
plant
she
once
was
that
she
realized
how
vulnerable
she
had
become.
If
this
body
died,
there
would
be
no
network
of
vines
to
retreat
through,
no
roots
to
regrow
her...but
she
felt
truly
alive.
She
was
reborn,
and
there
was
so
much
now
within
her
grasp.
