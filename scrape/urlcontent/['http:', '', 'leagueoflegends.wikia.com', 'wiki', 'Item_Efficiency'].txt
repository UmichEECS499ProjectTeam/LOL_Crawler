Gold
efficiency
is
a
term
that
compares
an
item
's
purchase
price
in
the
in-game
shop
to
the
amount
of
gold
that
item
is
actually
worth,
based
on
the
stats
it
provides.

Calculating
Gold
Efficiency
There
are
several
basic
items
in
League
of
Legends
that
grant
just
one
stat.
These
items
are
used
as
a
baseline
to
determine
the
gold
value
of
their
respective
stats.
Whether
or
not
an
item
is
gold
efficient
can
be
determined
by
comparing
the
item's
in-game
purchase
price
to
its
theoretical
price
,
which
is
the
combined
gold
value
of
all
the
stats
the
item
provides.
If
the
theoretical
price
of
an
item
is
greater
than
its
purchase
price
in
the
shop,
then
that
item
is
gold
efficient
by
x
gold,
where
x
is
the
difference
between
theoretical
price
and
purchase
price.
If
the
theoretical
price
of
an
item
is
less
than
its
purchase
price
in
the
shop,
then
that
item
is
not
gold
efficient,
but
instead
possesses
a
gold
deficit
of
x
gold,
where
x
is
the
difference
between
theoretical
price
and
purchase
price.
For
an
item
that
is
not
gold
efficient,
the
amount
of
gold
its
passive
and/or
active
abilities
must
be
worth
in
order
to
achieve
gold
efficiency
is
equal
to
its
gold
deficit.
Note
that
the
gold
values
assigned
to
stats
are
not
measures
of
those
stats'
effectiveness.
These
values
are
simply
base
prices
for
use
in
determining
the
theoretical
prices
of
higher-tier
items.
The
goal
of
this
page
is
not
to
state
which
stats
(or
items)
are
the
best;
rather,
it
is
to
provide
a
more
accurate
valuation
of
items
by
taking
into
account
not
only
an
item's
yield
(stats
and
abilities),
but
also
what
a
player
must
forfeit
in
order
to
enjoy
that
yield
(gold
spent
in
the
shop).

external
tabular
analysis
of
items'
gold
efficiencies

A

Doran's

are
meant
to
be
powerful
early
game,
but
lose
effectiveness
in
the
later
stages
of
the

they
do
not

into
the
higher-tier
items

in
the
late
game.

Gold-generating
items
are
items
that,
while
being
moderately
inefficient
to
start
out,
boost
the
gold
income
of
the
user
independently
of
obtaining
last
hits,
thus
potentially
allowing
any
of
them
to
become
gold
efficient
given
enough
time.
Unlike
the
Doran's
items,
these
items
all
have
intermediate

upgrades.
