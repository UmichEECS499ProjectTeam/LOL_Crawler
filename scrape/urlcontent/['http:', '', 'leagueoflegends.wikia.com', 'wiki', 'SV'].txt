Notes
Although
this
item
technically
loses
the
passive
of
its
component
item,
Spectre's
Cowl
,
nothing
is
effectively
lost
from
upgrading
it.
The
health
regen
granted
exceeds
that
of
the
lost
passive
and
no
longer
requires
a
trigger.
The
passive
will
work
if
the
ability
or
effect
is
yours
and
has
any
of
these
words
in
them
(or
something
similar):
heal
,
restore
,
drain,
regain
,
regen
or
refund
.
Passive
has
no
effect
with
abilities
that
grant
health
or
other
forms
of
temporary
health,
such
as
Lulu's
Wild
Growth
or
shields
.
Passive
will
not
increase
the
amount
of
an
allied
heal
used
on
you
(eg
Soraka's
Astral
Blessing
)
nor
any
of
your
heals
used
on
others.
Your
heals
that
can
simultaneously
affect
both
yourself
and
others
(eg
Taric's
Imbue
or
Soraka's
Wish
)
will
be
increased
for
you
but
not
for
any
allies.
This
passive
works
well
with
any
champion
with
life
steal
,
spell
vamp
,
or
self-healing
built
in
their
kit.
