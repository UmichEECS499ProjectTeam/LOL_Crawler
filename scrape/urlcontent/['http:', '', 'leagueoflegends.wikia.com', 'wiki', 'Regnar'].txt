Rengar,
the
Pridestalker
is
a
champion
in
League
of
Legends
.
[1]
Abilities
Rengar's
abilities
have
no
cost
related
to
them
and
their
use
is
limited
only
by
cooldowns.
Instead,
he
uses
his
secondary
resource
bar
to
display
his
unique
mechanic:
Ferocity.
Rengar
builds
1
point
of
Ferocity
whenever
he
lands
an
ability.
Upon
reaching
5
Ferocity,
Rengar
gains
the
ability
to
cast
an
alternate
set
of
abilities,
which
are
empowered
versions
of
his
basic
abilities.
The
two
ability-sets
do
not
share
cooldowns,
and
his
basic
abilities'
cooldowns
will
continue
to
count
down
while
his
empowered
abilities
are
available.
His
empowered
abilities
have
no
cooldown
and
can
be
used
whenever
5
Ferocity
is
available,
though
using
an
empowered
ability
consumes
all
5
Ferocity.

range

attacks
cause
him
to
leap
at
his
target.
This
bonus
lasts
for
~0.5
second
upon
exiting
brush
or
stealth.
This
will
happen
regardless
of
whether
or
not
his
target
has
sight
of
him,
and
has
no
internal
cooldown.
