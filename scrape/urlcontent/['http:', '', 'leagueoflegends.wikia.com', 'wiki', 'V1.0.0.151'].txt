Legends
V1.0.0.151
Champions
Zed,
the
Master
of
Shadows
Contempt
for
the
Weak
(Innate)
Whenever
Zed
attacks
an
enemy
below
50%
Health,
he
deals
an
additional
6%/8%/10%
of
their
maximum
Health
as
magic
damage.
This
effect
has
a
short
cooldown.
Razor
Shuriken
(Q)
Zed
and
his
shadow
both
throw
their
shurikens,
dealing
physical
damage
to
any
target
they
pass
through.
Each
Shuriken
deals
less
damage
to
targets
beyond
the
first.
Living
Shadow
(W)
Zed's
shadow
dashes
forward,
remaining
in
place
for
a
short
duration.
Zed's
shadow
will
duplicate
his
spells.
Activating
Living
Shadow
again
while
his
shadow
is
active
will
cause
Zed
to
switch
positions
with
his
shadow.
If
both
Zed
and
his
shadow
strike
the
same
target
with
Razor
Shurikens
or
Shadow
Slash,
Zed
re-gains
some
energy
and
the
target
suffers
an
additional
effect:
Razor
Shurikens
deal
additional
bonus
damage
and
the
slow
from
Shadow
Slash
is
dramatically
increased.
Shadow
Slash
(E)
Zed
and
his
shadow
both
create
a
burst
of
shadow,
dealing
physical
damage
to
nearby
enemies.
Zed's
Shadow
Slash
slightly
reduces
the
cooldown
of
Living
Shadow
by
for
each
unit
struck.
The
shadow's
Shadow
Slash
briefly
slows
enemies.
Death
Mark
(Ultimate)
Zed
sinks
into
the
shadows
and
dashes
to
his
target,
dealing
physical
damage.
He
also
spawns
a
Living
Shadow
beyond
the
target,
which
duplicates
his
spells
and
marks
the
target.
After
3
seconds,
the
mark
will
detonate,
dealing
physical
damage
based
on
the
damage
dealt
to
the
target
by
Zed
and
his
shadow
while
the
mark
was
active.
Zed
can
reactivate
this
ability
to
switch
positions
with
this
shadow.
