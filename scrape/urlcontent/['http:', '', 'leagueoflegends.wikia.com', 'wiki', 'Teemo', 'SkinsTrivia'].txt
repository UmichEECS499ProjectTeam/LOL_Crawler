Trivia
Teemo
was
designed
by
Ezreal
.
Teemo
was
one
of
the
first
champions
to
introduce
a
dance
change.
His
dance
was
changed
to
the
famous
Badger
Song
dance.
Teemo
could
be
seen
in
the
season
3
Scout
mastery
icon.
Teemo
is
the
one
of
two
(second
is
Evelynn
)
champions
that
can
actually
be
in
stealth
forever.
Teemo's
blowgun
is
seen
in
a
weapons
cabinet
in
the
Mac
Version
Launch
video.
Teemo
is
also
the
smallest
champion
in
League
of
Legends.
His
size
is
100x100
Units,
making
players
use
him
as
some
sort
of
scale
for
ranges.
Skins
Badger
Teemo
is
a
reference
to
the
flash
cartoon
Badger
Song
created
by
British
animator
Jonti
Picking
,
alias
Weebl.
Happy
Elf
Teemo's
Splash
Art
contains
a
snowman
in
the
background
which
resembles
Urgot
,
there
is
also
Reindeer
Kog'Maw
and
Santa
Gragas
in
the
sky.
Astronaut
Teemo's
mushrooms
are
changed
to
receiver
dishes,
his
darts
are
changed
to
laser
beams,
he
walks
in
low
gravity,
and
also
makes
his
voice
sound
like
it's
coming
from
a
radio.
Cottontail
Teemo's
mushrooms
are
changed
to
eggs,
and
he
hops
when
moving
instead
of
walking.
Teemo's
Cottontail
skin
is
a
reference
to
the
cottontail
genus
of
rabbits,
and
possibly
the
fictional
Peter
Cottontail
.
Riot
has
formally
acknowledged
the
presence
of
a
'global
taunt'
when
using
the
Cottontail
Teemo
skin.
Super
Teemo's
costume
references
Superman
.
Super
Teemo's
mushrooms
become
levitating
shields
with
a
T
on
them.
He
also
flies
during
the
active
of
Move
Quick
,
while
a
trumpet
plays
the
famous
"DA
DA
DA
DAAAAA!".
The
skin
may
be
a
reference
to
some
Justice
League
members
branding
Superman
as
a
big
blue
boy
scout
.
The
skin
price
was
revealed
by
the
comic
book
style
artwork
that
the
skin
was
revealed
in.
The
price
of
the
"comic"
indicates
975
,
which
is
the
price
of
the
skin.
The
announce
post
of
the
superhero
skin
contains
many
references
to
Superman.
It
is
titled
"This
Looks
Like
a
Job
for
Super
Teemo!",
referring
to
the
catch
phrase
"This
looks
like
a
job
for
Superman!"
"Look!
Up
in
the
sky!
It’s
a
cryophoenix!
It’s
a
gyrocopter!
It’s
Super
Teemo!"
refers
to
the
lines
"Look!
Up
in
the
sky!
It’s
a
bird...
it’s
a
plane...
it’s
Superman!"
from
the
Superman
musicals.
"[F]aster
than
a
speeding
Rammus,
more
powerful
than
a
mighty
Cho’gath,
and
able
to
leap
tall
yordles
in
a
single
bound"
refers
to
the
lines
"Faster
than
a
speeding
bullet!
More
powerful
than
a
locomotive!
Able
to
leap
tall
buildings
in
a
single
bound!"
from
the
Superman
theatrical
cartoons.
"[T]he
never-ending
battle
for
truth,
justice,
and
the
Bandle
City
way"
refers
to
the
quote
"The
never-ending
battle
for
truth,
justice,
and
the
American
way".
"[M]etropolitan
area"
refers
to
Superman's
home
city,
Metropolis.
Panda
Teemo
uses
Zongzi
(rice
dumplings),
replacing
the
mushroom
of
Noxious
Trap
,
which
indicates
that
this
skin
was
likely
created
for
celebrating
the
traditional
Chinese
Duanwu
Festival
.
The
exact
date
of
the
festival
varies
every
year
in
modern
calender.
In
2012
it
was
23
June.
Relations

and
Tristana
became
close
friends

and
are

to
be
a
couple.

shot
Veigar
down
after
his
failed
attempt
to

The
Mothership
.
