Shyvana,
the
Half-Dragon
is
a
champion
in
League
of
Legends
.
[1]
Abilities
Shyvana's
abilities
have
no
cost
related
to
them,
and
the
use
of
her
abilities
is
only
limited
by
cooldowns.
Instead
she
uses
Fury
as
her
secondary
resource.
Fury
is
only
needed
as
a
requirement
for
the
use
of
her
ultimate
Dragon's
Descent
,
which
allows
her
to
change
form
if
she
has
100
Fury
and
remain
in
that
state
for
as
long
as
she
has
Fury.
Shyvana
won't
generate
Fury
unless
she
has
at
least
one
point
in
Dragon's
Descent
,
and
once
she
puts
the
first
point
on
the
skill
she
will
gain
100
Fury
immediately.
Any
gained
Fury
cannot
be
lost
except
by
depletion
during
Dragon
Form.
Dragonborn
Shyvana
gains
5
/
10
/
15

20
armor
and
magic
resist.
These
bonuses
are
doubled
in
Dragon
Form.
Ability

Active:
Shyvana's
next
autoattack
will
strike
twice
in
one
swift
movement.
The
second

will

physical
damage
equal
to
a
percentage
of
her
total
attack
damage.
Both
attacks
will
trigger
on-hit
effects.
Shyvana's
autoattacks
against
non-structures
reduce
the

by

seconds.
Dragon

will
damage
all
units
in
front
of
Shyvana
when
she
uses
her
next
autottack
instead
of
just
her
target.
Each
unit
hit
will
both
trigger
on-hit
effects
and
grant
fury
twice.

Ability
Details
Twin
Bite
is
an
on-hit
effect
ability.
In
Dragon
form,
it
becomes
a
conic
area
of
effect
ability.
The
triggering
attack(s)
will
apply
other
on-hit
effects
and
can
critically
strike
as
normal.
The
second
hit
will
trigger
on-hit
effects
itself,
but
cannot
critically
strike.
Critical
strikes
for
Twin
Bite
in
Dragon
form
are
calculated
per
cast,
not
per
unit
hit.
The
bonus
damage
from
Twin
Bite
is
effective
against
structures.
Twin
Bite's
damage
is
negated
block
,
blind
,
dodge
and
parry
.
Spell
shields
will
block
the
entire
enhanced

not
effective
against

The
only
exception

Twin
Bite
applying
on-hit
effects
to
all
affected
targets
is
Tiamat
and
Ravenous
Hydra's
passive
effect
Cleave
,
as
it
has
an
internal
cooldown
of
0.
05
seconds
when
triggered
on
different
targets.
This
is
a
special
case
to
prevent
abuse.

speed
,
Twin
Bite
has
a
minimum
