For
the
summoner
spell
formerly
known
as
Boost,
see
Cleanse
.
A
boost
temporarily
increases
the
amount
of
Influence
Points
or
Summoner
Experience
Points
gained
at
the
conclusion
of
each
match.
There
are
two
kinds
of
boosts:
duration
boosts
and
win
boosts.
Each
of
them
can
be
bought
from
the
Riot
Store
using
Riot
Points
or
received
from
Riot
(often
compensatorily).

Duration
boosts
Duration
boosts
are
active
for
a
certain
amount
of
time
(for
example,
1
day).
Duration
boosts
double
the
base
amount
of
IP
received
for
any
type
of
game
win
or
lose,
not
counting
other
bonuses.
Examples
of
those
other
bonuses
which
are
not
doubled
include
the
first
win
of
the
day
bonus,
the
match-made
game
bonus,
or
a
bonus
from
another
boost.
Per
win
boosts
Per
win
boosts
are
only
applied
if
you
win
a
game
–
they
will
never
expire.
Per
win
boosts
give
you
a
flat
amount
of
IP
equivalent
to
the
max
base
IP
you
can
earn
from
a
game
(values
are
different
for
each
game
mode).
This
change
was
made
to
ensure
players
were
getting
the
most
out
of
their
boost
for
extremely
short
games,
but
Riot
hasn't
updated
the
explanations
of
how
per
win
boosts
work.
Because
of
how
per
win
boosts
work,
they
will
give
much
less
IP
for
Dominion
,
Custom
,
Twisted
Treeline
and
Co-op
vs.
AI
games.

boost
If
you
combine
a
duration
boost
and

bonuses

as
both
are
active.
During

events,

has
given
the
community
free
IP
boosts.
