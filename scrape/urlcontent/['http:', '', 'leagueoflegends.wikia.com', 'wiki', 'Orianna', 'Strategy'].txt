Skill
usage
Spellsword
has
decent
synergy
with
Clockwork
Windup
,
especially
later
on
in
the
game.
The
ball
moves
slowly,
so
calling
it
back
to
use
Command:
Attack
is
not
ideal.
Use
Command:
Attack
to
position
the
ball
near
the
enemy
and
then
simply
use
it
again
to
harass
.
This
way
the
ball
can
hit
them
easily.
Remember
that
the
ball
deals
damage
to
any
enemies
it
passes
through,
no
matter
what
command
it
is
following.
Use
this
to
get
multiple
harassing
passes
in
quick
succession.
Command:
Attack
provides
sight.
Use
it
to
check
bushes
before
approaching
to
prevent
ganks.
Command:
Protect
can
be
used
on
yourself
to
return
the
ball
back
to
you
quickly.
Combine
this
with
Command:
Attack
for
quick
harassment.
Command:
Attack
+
Command:
Dissonance
can
provide
much
better
damage
for
harassing
and
a
slowing
effect
to
disrupt
the
enemy,
but
costs
much
more
mana
to
repeat.
The
simple
presence
of
the
Ball
is
very
intimidating
for
champions,
as
they
know
that
if
they
are
close
to
it
you
can
easily
hit
them.
Position
it
to
zone
your
lane
opponent
and
give
it
a
hard
time
farming
Command:
Dissonance
is
a
very
powerful
escape
tool
if
Orianna
has
the
ball.
The
combination
of
a
movement
speed
boost
and
leaving
a
slowing
AoE
can
be
quite
powerful.
Command:
Shockwave
can
be
used
to
drag
enemies
towards
or
away
from
you
if
you
position
the
ball
properly.
Command:
Shockwave
can
create
great
synergy
with
all
AoE
skills,
since
it
flings
enemies
towards
the
ball,
so
if
you
manage
to
catch
the
whole
team,
they
will
most
likely
be
flung
into
the
same
place,
making
it
a
great
opportunity
to
use
skills
like
Annie's
Summon:
Tibbers
Command:
Shockwave
can
also
be
used
interrupt
channeling
abilities,
so
try
to
save
it
for
enemies
that
depend
on
channeled
abilities,
such
as
Katarina
and
her
Death
Lotus
,
or
Nunu's
Absolute
Zero
.
Using
Command:
Protect
on
an
initiator
is
a
powerful
strategy;
it
gives
the
initiator
an
armor
and
magic
resistance
buff,
a
shield
and
it
brings
the
ball
into
the
battle.
Just
make
sure
not
to
get
too
far
from
it.
You
can
assist
your
team
in
both
chasing
and
escaping,
thanks
to
your
Command:
Protect
and
Command:
Dissonance
.
You
are
squishy
without
any
survivability
items,
but
that
doesn't
have
to
be
a
problem
-
you
can
easily
keep
your
distance
and
order
your
ball
through
walls
or
use
it
as
a
shield
on
your
allies
(especially
tanks).
Orianna
has
a
variety
of
combos
according
to
the
situation.
When
starting
a
teamfight,
using
Command:
Attack
→
Command:
Dissonance
→
Command:
Shockwave
→
Command:
Protect
can
almost
turn
teamfights
on
your
control.
When
supporting,
use
Command:
Protect
on
an
allied
champion,
then
activate
Command:
Shockwave
→
Command:
Dissonance
.
Be
sure
that
you
use
Command:
Protect
or
Command:
Dissonance
often
to
have
a
total
support
on
your
team.
Build
usage
Orianna
is
a
very
mana
hungry
champion,
so
an
early
Catalyst
the
Protector
,
Tear
of
the
Goddess
or
Chalice
of
Harmony
are
very
good
choices.
This
can
also
be
remedied
by
buying
ability
power
and
cooldown
reduction
,
such
as
Athene's
Unholy
Grail
and
Morellonomicon
.
If
you
have
a
team
that
consists
of
3
or
more
casters,
then
Abyssal
Scepter
is
also
a
good
choice.
A
tanky
Orianna
build
with
35-40%
cooldown
reduction
can
lead
to
great
survivability
and
lets
you
escape
quite
easy,
thanks
to
Command:
Protect
and
Command:
Dissonance
,
while
still
being
able
to
support
your
team
well.
Since
all
four
of
Orianna's
abilities
can
deal
AoE
damage
and
scale
with
ability
power,
she
can
also
be
built
as
an
extremely
effective
burst
mage
by
putting
more
emphasis
on
ability
power
and
magic
penetration
than
cooldown
reduction
.
Builds
using
Sorcerer's
Shoes
,
Void
Staff
,
and
an
early
Rabadon's
Deathcap
(as
one
of
your
first
two
or
three
items)
can
produce
devastating
results
if
you
catch
three
or
more
enemy
champions
clumped
up,
which
will
happen
frequently
once
teamfights
start
taking
place.
Nashor's
Tooth
is
a
viable
alternative
to
Morellonomicon
when
building
cooldown
reduction,
providing
the
same
amount
of
cooldown
reduction
with
slightly
less
ability
power
,
but
a
substantial
boost
to
her
attack
speed
,
which
allows
her
to
better
utilize
Clockwork
Windup
.
It's
also
worth
noting
that
Nashor's
Tooth
is
a
bit
more
expensive,
so
consider
carefully
which
will
be
of
greater
value
when
itemizing
for
cooldown
reduction
.
It's
also
worth
noting
that
attack
speed
becomes
more
valuable
the
more
ability
power
you
have,
making
Nashor's
Tooth
most
effective
with
high
amounts
of
ability
power
.
However,
do
be
aware
that
relying
on
your
attacks
to
deal
damage
can
put
you
in
a
position
that
could
prove
fatal,
where
as
using
the
Ball
keeps
you
alive
much
easier.

Countering
Although
Orianna
is
partially
a
support,
she
is
primarily
a
burst
AoE
mage.
Her
damage
output
is
reasonably
high,
so
consider
getting
a
magic
resistance
item
to
hinder
most
of
her
damage.
When
playing
as
a
mage
champion,
it
is
advised
not
to
trade
auto-attacks
with
Orianna
,
as
her
Clockwork
Windup
makes
her
auto-attacks
stronger
than
yours.
Her
main
strength
comes
when
you
are
inside
her
ball's
AoE:
keep
out
of
it.
When
Orianna
uses
her
Command:
Attack
or
Command:
Protect
,
try
to
avoid
the
ball's
path
as
it
will
damage
any
enemy
it
passes
through.
Orianna's
ball
speed
is
fairly
slow.
Keeping
your
distance
away
from
her
ball
will
make
it
easier
to
dodge.
Standing
behind
minions
will
lower
the
damage
from
Orianna's
Command:
Attack
.
This
does
not
apply
to
Orianna's
Command:
Protect
,
as
it
deals
flat
damage
to
everything
it
hits.
Remember
that
even
if
you
dodge
Command:
Attack
,
she
can
still
Command:
Dissonance
or
Command:
Shockwave
if
you
are
in
range.
Staying
out
of
range
of
the
ball
is
key
to
avoiding
Orianna's
damage.
Command:
Attack
has
a
very
quick
cooldown
after
rank
5.
She
can
often
cast
it
several
times
in
fights,
so
avoid
prolongs
conflicts
with
her.
Champions
with
quick
burst,
like
Fizz
and
LeBlanc
can
excel
at
taking
her
down
before
she
can
do
too
much
damage,
so
long
as
they
are
not
hit
by
Command:
Dissonance
or
Command:
Shockwave
Avoid
over
committing
to
Orianna
or
any
of
her
allies
when
she's
around
without
considerable
damage.
Command:
Protect's
shield
can
be
deceptively
strong
with
the
added
armor
and
magic
resistance
from
the
Ball.
