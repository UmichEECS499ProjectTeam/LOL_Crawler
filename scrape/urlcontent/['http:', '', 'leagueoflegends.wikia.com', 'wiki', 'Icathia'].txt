Icathia
is
a
lost
city
in
the
southern
half
of
Valoran
.
Lore
Icathia
itself
is
considered
mythical
by
most,
though
those
who
believe
it
once
existed
were
certain
that
the
sands
had
long
since
devoured
whatever
remained.
The
believers
generally
agree
that
the
lost
city
was
located
somewhere
in
the
southern
half
of
Valoran
,
though
details
beyond
this
are
almost
entirely
unreliable
hearsay.
Many
explorers
have
struck
out
to
discover
Icathia,
but
the
only
fact
their
findings
universally
corroborate
is
that
just
about
everywhere
south
of
the
Great
Barrier
is
malevolent,
ominous,
and
spooky.
One
of
the
only
two
living
individuals
to
have
been
to
Icathia
and
whose
testimony
may
be
considered
anything
more
than
mere
delusion
is
Kassadin,
the
Void
Walker
.
It
is
said
that
he
found
his
way
to
the
forgotten
city
following
the
scant
breadcrumbs
hidden
in
ancient
texts.
Within
a
decaying
cyclopean
city,
Kassadin
found
secrets
of
the
kind
that
he
will
never
share
-
secrets
that
made
him
quake
with
fear
at
the
visions
of
things
to
come
that
were
thrust
upon
him.
The
power
of
the
place
threatened
to
consume
him
forever,
but
Kassadin
took
the
only
route
available
to
him
in
order
to
survive
-
he
let
the
Void
inside
him.
Miraculously,
he
was
able
to
overcome
the
alien
urges
that
went
with
it,
and
he
emerged
as
something
more
than
human.
The
other
individual
that's
said
to
have
been
to
Icathia
is
Malzahar,
the
Prophet
of
the
Void
.
He
claims
to
have
traveled
there
at
the
urging
of
an
unknown
entity
that
he
alone,
as
a
gifted
seer,
could
sense.
The
main
substance
of
his
report
of
Icathia,
besides
his
demented
visions
of
the
yawning
chaos
and
his
communion
with
the
entity
that
beckoned
him
thence,
consists
of
an
alien
geometry
of
a
ruined
city
adorned
with
bizarre
crumbling
obelisks
and
the
giant
decaying
idols
of
dark
and
horrific
gods.
As
he
looked
upon
them
his
eyes,
seeing
what
others
cannot,
and
what
none
should,
were
filled
with
the
essence
of
the
Void.
Trivia
Icathia
is
likely
based
off
a
lost
Arabian
city
named
"Iram
of
the
pillars"
which
has
been
mentioned
in
the
Quran,
and
later
on
became
a
significant
subject
in
H.
P.
Lovecraft
fictional
works.
As
such,
many
void
related
elements
in
LoL's
lore
appears
to
draw
inspiration
from
Lovecraft.
Malzahar
finding
Icathia
parallels
with
Lovecraftian
character
Abdul
Al'hazred
finding
Iram.
