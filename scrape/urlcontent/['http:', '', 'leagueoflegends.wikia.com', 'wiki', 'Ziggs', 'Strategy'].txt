Skill
usage
The
increased
damage
from
Short
Fuse
can
be
used
to
better
last
hit
minions
or
harass
an
enemy
champion.
Mega
Inferno
Bomb
can
be
used
on
enemies
near
a
turret
to
force
them
to
back
off.
It
is
also
a
very
effective
means
of
lane
control,
especially
when
your
jungler
is
pre-occupied
elsewhere
or
too
low
to
gank
a
lane.
Place
your
Mega
Inferno
Bomb
where
it
will
hit
most
of
the
enemy
team.
Mega
Inferno
Bomb
is
excellent
to
ruin
an
enemy
push
:
it
can
wipe
out
an
army
of
minions
and
heavily
damage
several
enemy
champions,
brutally
ending
any
attempt
to
push
and
also
giving
you
lots
of
gold.
Wait
for
the
enemy
team
to
be
as
close
as
possible
without
risking
to
damage
any
turret
for
maximum
efficiency.
Mega
Inferno
Bomb
works
well
with
a
strong
allied
AoE
CC
,
like
Amumu's
Curse
of
the
Sad
Mummy
or
Sona's
Crescendo
.
Satchel
Charge
,
Hexplosive
Minefield
(when
placed/detonated
by
enemies),
and
Mega
Inferno
Bomb
will
grant
vision
inside
brush
and
in
the
Fog
of
War
.
You
can
use
Mega
Inferno
Bomb's
great
range
to
gank
other
lanes
efficiently.
You
can
use
Satchel
Charge
to
throw
an
enemy
into
a
Hexplosive
Minefield
and
quickly
you
can
use
the
slow
to
land
a
perfect
Mega
Inferno
Bomb
.
If
your
passive
is
up,
or
an
enemy
is
escaping,
you
can
use
Satchel
Charge
to
bounce
the
enemy
towards
you
to
put
them
into
autoattack/skill
range.
It's
recommended
to
save
Satchel
Charge
in
teamfights
to
make
a
quick
escape
for
or
to
interrupt
channeled
spells
such
as
Katarina's
Death
Lotus
,
and
Karthus's
Requiem
.
Bouncing
Bomb
has
a
fast
travel
time
meaning
it
is
a
strong
tool
for
harass
especially
when
combined
with
Short
Fuse
to
play
the
hit
and
run
game.
Satchel
Charge
can
be
used
offensively
too.
Placing
it
in
the
middle
of
your
lane
and
walking
around
it
will
make
your
lane
opponents
scared
of
getting
too
close,
as
you
can
activate
it
for
a
huge
leap.
Satchel
Charge
combined
with
Hexplosive
Minefield
is
a
very
powerful
zoning
tool,
and
can
force
your
enemy
to
walk
in
the
direction
you
choose,
making
it
easy
to
land
a
Bouncing
Bomb
or
a
Mega
Inferno
Bomb
.
Hexplosive
Minefield
can
choke
off
large
portions
of
jungle
routes
which
effectively
deters
chasing
enemy
champions.
Bouncing
Bomb
's
range
is
greater
than
the
enemy's
vision
range
when
thrown
at
maximum
range
with
three
bounces.
Enemies
won't
be
able
to
see
the
bombs
until
the
last
second,
so
use
this
to
effectively
land
Bouncing
Bomb
harass
at
a
safe
distance.
Build
usage
Ziggs
naturally
suffers
from
long
cooldowns
and
the
high
mana
costs.
Itemize
to
counteract
these
deficiencies.
Morellonomicon
is
a
strong
item
on
Ziggs,
providing
AP,
cooldown
reduction
,
and
mana
regeneration
.
Sheen
works
well
with
his
passive,
Short
Fuse
.
It
can
be
later
turned
into
Lich
Bane
.
Athene's
Unholy
Grail
gives
Ziggs
everything
he
needs,
intense
mana
regeneration
,
cooldown
reduction
,
and
of
course
Ability
Power
.
Grabbing
an
early
Chalice
of
Harmony
is
good
laning
choice
because
of
its
high
Mana
Regen
and
Magic
resistance
,
allowing
you
to
harass
constantly
and
take
less
damage
from
your
opponent.
Additionally,
consider
building
Tear
of
the
Goddess
,
as
his
Bouncing
Bomb
is
spammable
in
high
ranks
and
cooldown
reduction.
This
can
later
be
built
into
an
Archangel's
Staff
and
later
Seraph's
Embrace
which
will
grant
Ziggs
more
protection
for
some
mana
cost.

Countering
Getting
early
Boots
of
Speed
will
allow
you
to
better
avoid
Ziggs'
main
early
source
of
damage
â€“
Bouncing
Bomb
.
Later
in
the
game,
it
can
be
upgraded
into
Boots
of
Swiftness
giving
you
an
easier
time
avoiding
all
of
his
spells.
With
proper
timing,
Ziggs's
Bouncing
Bomb
can
be
dodged
by
running
underneath
it
in
between
bounces.
Try
to
avoid
fighting
Ziggs
in
the
jungle,
as
Hexplosive
Minefield
can
block
off
potential
escape
routes
and
and
the
narrow
pathways
make
it
easier
for
him
to
land
all
his
abilities,
including
Mega
Inferno
Bomb
.
Ziggs
deals
mostly
magic
damage.
Building
magic
resistance
items
will
reduce
your
damage
taken.
All
of
Ziggs's
spells
except
Bouncing
Bomb
have
a
very
long
cooldown
at
early
levels;
engage
him
after
he
finishes
casting
his
abilities.
Stay
away
from
the
center
of
his
Mega
Inferno
Bomb
,
as
the
spell
will
deal
less
damage
if
you
are
outside
the
center.
You
can
tell
when
where
it
will
land
by
the
circle
it
creates
before
it
lands.
Stay
away
from
his
Hexplosive
Minefield
to
avoid
the
slow.
A
champion
with
a
spell
shield
ability
or
pets
can
also
demolish
the
mine
field.
