Skill
usage
Evelynn
is
an
effective
roamer.
Use
Shadow
Walk
to
scout
out
and
surprise
enemy
champions
that
overextend
and
possibly
get
a
kill.
This
is
most
effective
early
game.
By
roaming,
this
allows
your
solo
laner
to
farm
minions
while
keeping
the
enemy
solo
back
and
losing
them
gold
and
experience.
Evelynn
can
excel
at
pushing
a
lane
and
jungling
by
spamming
Hate
Spike
.
Try
to
stand
so
it
hits
many
creeps.
Level
up
Ravage
first
for
an
AD/On-hit
build
and
Hate
Spike
first
for
an
AP
build.
Use
Ravage
on
a
nearby
minion
when
attacking
a
tower.
Evelynn
is
a
good
partner
for
Maokai
or
Kassadin
.
Her
Hate
Spike
will
help
to
proc
Maokai's
Sap
Magic
and
Kassadin's
Force
Pulse
.
On
the
other
hand,
she
is
ineffective
against
either
of
them,
for
the
same
reason.
Your
Shadow
Walk
can
be
easily
neutralized
by
Vision
Wards
early
game.
Don't
be
too
hasty
in
attacking
early.
Take
your
time,
scope
out
the
battle
before
joining
and
use
your
element
of
surprise
to
your
advantage.
Purchasing
a
Scrying
Orb
will
enable
you
to
see
Vision
Wards
in
bushes
before
you
are
even
noticed.
Use
Dark
Frenzy
to
return
to
and
move
among
lanes
faster.
Be
careful
using
this
before
a
gank
in
case
you
need
it
to
escape.
With
a
maxed
out
Ravage
attack
speed
boost,
you
need
a
118.8%
boost
to
reach
the
cap.
Evelynn
is
a
great
scout
as
she
can
walk
past
regular
Sight
Wards
without
being
seen.
Be
wary
of
Vision
Wards
,
as
their
true
sight
can
detect
stealth
units,
however
they
can
be
seen
so
you
can
find
them,
destroy
them
and
come
back
shortly
for
a
gank.
Since
Agony's
Embrace
is
based
on
the
current
health
of
the
enemy
and
has
no
minimum
damage,
avoid
using
it
on
low-health
opponents.
The
damage
will
be
incredibly
low.
For
that
reason,
if
you
are
going
to
use
Agony's
Embrace
,
always
initiate
with
it,
so
you
do
the
most
damage,
before
your
opponent's
health
is
down.
Build
usage
Evelynn's
Shadow
Walk
takes
care
of
most
of
your
mana
issues.
If
you
are
saving
your
mana
for
harassing
only,
you
might
not
even
need
to
build
mana
items
at
all,
however,
the
low
CD
and
low
mana
cost
of
Hate
Spike
makes
it
extremely
useful
for
farming.
An
early
Sapphire
Crystal
and
its
build
path
(especially
Sheen
items)
will
drastically
improve
Shadow
Walk's
passive
mana
regen
as
it
scales
with
her
maximum
mana
.
However,
an
early
Sapphire
Crystal
can
leave
your
damage
low
until
you
buy
Sheen
,
which
is
somewhat
expensive
early
on.
The
low
cooldown
on
Hate
Spike
allows
Evelynn
to
make
full
use
of
Lich
Bane
/
Trinity
Force
/
Iceborn
Gauntlet
giving
her
a
large
damage
boost
and
making
one
of
these
a
core
item
for
her.
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
to
constantly
slow
enemies.
Quickly
max
Tear
of
the
Goddess
/
Archangel's
Staff
/
Manamune
.
Though
the
mana
regen
isn't
really
needed
with
her
Shadow
Walk
.
They
can
be
cost
effective
if
you
have
a
lot
of
other
mana
items,
such
as
Frozen
Heart
,
Iceborn
Gauntlet
,
and
Trinity
Force
.
It
also
helps
quickly
stack
Guinsoo's
Rageblade
making
it
very
cost
effective
for
a
DPS
build,
but
not
a
burst
build
since
you
won't
have
the
stacks
when
you
need
to
burst
someone.
With
both
AD
and
AP,
her
AS
buff
can
effectively
mix
and
match
any
offensive
item.
See
what
defenses
the
enemy
is
building
so
you
can
adapt
within
your
build.
For
instance,
if
they
build
Thornmail
when
you're
playing
Hybrid,
build
Wit's
End
instead
of
Trinity
Force
.
If
they
all
build
magic
resist
then
avoid
building
AP.
If
they
build
health,
then
Deathfire
Grasp
with
AP
+
CDR
for
your
ult
can
help,
but
items
with
sustain
such
as
Hextech
Gunblade
or
Blade
of
the
Ruined
King
can
let
you
fight
tanks
indefinitely,
and
can
also
be
a
good
choice.
Some
good
items
are:
AD
(
The
Black
Cleaver
/
Trinity
Force
,
Infinity
Edge
,
or
The
Bloodthirster
).
For
more
single
target
damage
and
sustained
damage
against
low-mid
range
armored
targets
if
you
buy
Black
Cleaver.
AP
(
Archangel's
Staff
,
Rabadon's
Deathcap
,
and
Lich
Bane
).
For
more
multi-target
damage
and
better
burst.
On-Hit
(
Nashor's
Tooth
,
Blade
of
the
Ruined
King
and
Wit's
End
).
For
high
single
target
damage
against
low
magic
resist
targets.
*See
below
for
the
attack
speed
cap.
Hybrid
(
Trinity
Force
,
Wit's
End
Hextech
Gunblade
and
Guinsoo's
Rageblade
).
For
a
balance.
Hybrid
is
squishy
if
you
invest
purely
in
offensive
power,
and
since
it
relies
on
being
in
melee
range,
you
will
usually
need
to
have
at
least
2
tanky
items
to
survive.
For
mixed
melee
and
spell
damage,
single
and
AOE
targets
with
a
mix
of
survivability
as
well
as
mid-high
armor,
magic
resistance
and
hit
point
targets
you
can
utilize
an
item
set
such
as:
Iceborn
Gauntlet
,
Liandry's
Torment
,
Spirit
of
the
Elder
Lizard
,
and
The
Black
Cleaver
.
This
will
maximize
damage
penetration
as
well
as
provide
defense,
crowd
control
and
destroy
high
hit
point
targets
with
high
efficiency
as
well
as
allowing
her
to
wave
clear
minions
and
monster
camps
with
extreme
ease.
It
will
also
apply
all
three
types
of
damage
while
providing
two
DoT's
to
an
escaping
target.
Finishing
the
build
off
with
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
and
a
pair
of
Sorcerer's
Shoes
provides
maximum
damage
and
maintains
the
target/target's
will
never
escape
while
producing
more
damage
AND
survivability.
Note
that
Evelynn
is
inherently
squishy,
so
any
melee
oriented
builds
must
have
some
items
devoted
to
tankiness,
such
as
Iceborn
Gauntlet
or
Randuin's
Omen
.
Actually,
all
builds
require
Evelynn
to
get
very
close
to
blow
her
target,
particularly
if
she
wants
to
hit
Ravage
that
is
her
main
instant
nuke
by
late
game,
both
on
AP
(very
high
ratio)
and
AD
(high
ratio)
she
has
to
nearly
get
to
melee
range.
If
you
notice
focus
into
you,
for
AD
the
aforementioned
items
might
suffice,
but
a
Frozen
Mallet
makes
Evelynn
more
undesirable
to
focus
and
resilient
to
upfront
burst,
it
offer
little
damage
however
and
should
only
be
obtained
if
under
heavy
focus
For
AP
you
can
grab
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
or
Rod
of
Ages
.
While
you
won't
normally
buy
both
you
might
need
to
if
you
find
yourself
under
heavy
focus.
Since
Ravage
gives
you
120%
attack
speed
bonus,
you
can
reach
the
2.500
attack
speed
cap
very
easily.
Try
to
not
get
more
than
about
100
additional
AS.
Speed
items,
such
as
Phantom
Dancer
and
Boots
of
Mobility
allow
you
to
gank
a
lot
faster
and
gain
extra
kills,
keep
enemies
more
uncertain
where
you
are,
and
help
you
escape
if
you're
seen
out
of
position.
Keep
in
mind
that
slows
are
more
powerful
than
Hastes
(Movespeed
buffs),
and
that
movespeed
items
do
not
give
much
tankiness,
so
if
you
are
caught
or
like
going
into
melee
range,
a
tankier
item
would
be
better
thanks
to
the
movespeed
bonus
from
Dark
Frenzy
.
Think
twice
before
buying
enemy
affecting
aura
items
such
as
Frozen
Heart
as
the
enemy
can
notice
these
affects
from
a
distance,
alerting
them
to
your
presence
and
possibly
ruining
your
surprise.
Ally
affecting
aura
items
can
also
be
noticed,
but
with
more
difficulty.
This
is
not
an
issue
with
Abyssal
Scepter
due
to
this
item
having
only
600
range,
while
Evelynn's
stealth
range
is
700.

Always
look
out
for
Evelynn
in
your
lane.
Because
of
her
stealth,
she
can
easily
sneak
behind
unsuspecting
players
who
are
overextended.
Be
aware
that
her
movement
speed
boost
can
make
her
very
surprising.
You
can
protect
your
lane
by
purchasing
Vision
Ward
s
and
placing
them
in
the
river.
Be
careful
if
using
Sight
Ward
s
as
if
she
comes
into
your
brush
already
stealthed,
you
will
not
be
able
to
see
her
until
she
unstealths,
and
that
may
be
too
late.
Evelynn
can
be
built
with
either
Ability
Power
,
Attack
Damage
or
even
a
mix
of
both.
Pay
attention
to
the
way
she
builds
to
better
decide
what
defensive
items
you
should
buy.
However,
she
still
deals
a
lot
of
magic
damage
even
with
an
Attack
Damage
build,
so
Magic
Resistance
is
rarely
a
bad
option
against
her.
If
Evelynn
is
building
AD,
she
has
a
very
weak
early
and
mediocre
mid,
but
trades
for
extremely
high
damage
late
game.
If
you
are
a
squishy
champ,
stay
behind
tanks
and
try
to
focus
her
down.
Evelynn's
stealth
is
lost
when
she
takes
damage.
Harassing
her
greatly
reduces
her
sneaking
ability.
If
you
think
Evelynn
is
near,
use
skill
or
AoE
spells
(Like
a
Ziggs's
Bouncing
Bomb
or
Ezreal's
Mystic
Shot
)
in
her
direction.
If
they
hit
it
will
disable
her
passive
and
reveal
her.
