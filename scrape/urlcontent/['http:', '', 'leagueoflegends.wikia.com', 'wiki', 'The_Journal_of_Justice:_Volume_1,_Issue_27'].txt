Veigar
Attempts
Abduction
of
Bandle
City
Mothership
Tiny
Master
of
Evil’s
Plans
Foiled
by
Sharp-Winged
Geese
Kaldera
Carnadine
reporting
from
Bandle
City
Teemo
takes
aim
as
the
Tiny
Master
of
Evil
attempts
a
daring
escape.
The
plans
of
the
mastermind
behind
the
Horseshoe
Heist
and
Balloon
Burglary—none
other
than
Veigar,
the
Tiny
Master
of
Evil
himself—nearly
came
to
fruition
yesterday
morning
in
a
grand
attempt
to
abduct
Bandle
City’s
beloved
Mothership.
While
his
plans
were
foiled
by
a
migrating
flock
of
geese,
Veigar
managed
to
escape
the
city
following
his
defeat.
The
Mothership
itself
was
unharmed
by
the
ordeal.
Over
the
past
few
weeks,
the
Institute
of
War
has
worked
alongside
the
Scouts
of
the
Mothership
on
investigation
of
the
Horseshoe
Heist
and
the
Balloon
Burglary
in
Bandle
City.
The
Scouts
of
the
Mothership
confirmed
a
connection
between
the
two
events
based
on
similar
traces
of
magical
energy
left
behind
at
the
respective
crime
scenes.
As
the
Scouts
prepared
to
continue
their
investigation
yesterday,
Veigar
reportedly
appeared
in
a
burst
of
dark
magic
atop
the
yordles
’
famed
Mothership.
“We
had
the
magical
evidence,
but
we
hardly
needed
it:
he’d
tied
the
horseshoes
to
the
stolen
balloons
and
enchanted
them
both,”
said
one
Scout
representative.
Veigar’s
plan
quickly
became
obvious:
the
horseshoes’
shape
allowed
them
to
slip
perfectly
under
the
curved
metal
of
the
Mothership’s
nose
cone
and
his
enchanted
balloons
threatened
to
lift
the
Mothership
from
the
ground.
A
crowd
of
yordles
gathered
at
the
scene
gasped
as
the
metal
groaned
under
the
strain
of
the
tugging
balloons.
The
Tiny
Master
of
Evil
addressed
the
crowd:
“Just
try
to
laugh
at
me
now,
foolish
yordles!
We’ll
see
how
long
your
pathetic
‘unity’
lasts
without
your
precious
Mothership!”
When
one
concerned
onlooker
asked
what
he
planned
to
do
with
the
abducted
Mothership,
Veigar
paused,
then
replied:
“…don’t
bother
me
with
the
details!”
As
Veigar
spoke
to
the
gathered
yordles,
a
flock
of
sharp-winged
thresher
geese
approached
from
the
west.
Veigar
remained
oblivious
to
their
presence:
“He
was
too
busy
talking
to
notice,”
said
Colin
Dee,
a
Tenderfoot
victim
of
the
Balloon
Burglary
and
witness
at
the
Mothership.
“He
should’ve
known,
though.
Even
first-year
Tenderfeets
know
that
it’s
sharp-winged
thresher
geese
season
right
now.”
The
flock
of
predatory
birds
passed
above
the
Mothership
and
sliced
though
all
but
one
of
Veigar’s
enchanted
balloons,
deflating
them
immediately.
In
the
face
of
impending
and
accidental
defeat,
Veigar
tugged
the
final
balloon
free
of
its
horseshoe
and
began
to
rise
into
the
sky,
claiming
that
Bandle
City
“hadn’t
seen
the
last
of
him”
and
that
he
would
“get
them
next
time.”
However,
League
Champion
Teemo
,
having
just
arrived
at
the
Mothership,
took
aim
and
burst
Veigar’s
last
balloon
with
a
single
dart.
The
Tiny
Master
of
Evil
plummeted
into
the
tree
line
just
outside
the
city.
Bandle
City
officials
were
unable
to
locate
the
Tiny
Master
of
Evil
following
his
escape
from
the
battle,
noting
that
it
is
likely
he
escaped
through
magical
means.
Most
efforts
were
focused
on
inspection
of
the
Mothership,
which,
despite
its
preexisting
state
of
disarray,
had
miraculously
suffered
no
apparent
damage.
Many
onlookers,
however,
commented
in
disdain
that
the
Mothership
appeared
to
have
shifted
“just
slightly
to
the
left.”
Intruder
Discovered
in
Kalamanda's
Prison
Unidentified
suspect
escapes
apprehension
by
Demacian
forces
Kaldera
Carnadine
reporting
from
Kalamanda
A
note
left
by
the
intruder
in
Kalamanda’s
prison.
An
anonymous
tip
led
the
remaining
Demacian
guards
in
Kalamanda
to
the
remnants
of
the
local
prison
last
night,
resulting
in
a
scuffle
with
an
unidentified
intruder.
The
suspect
was
caught
searching
the
same
ward
in
which
the
Demacian
prisoner
was
assassinated
in
June.
After
a
violent
confrontation
with
the
Might
of
Demacia
and
a
host
of
guards,
he
escaped
into
the
night.
Investigators
have
since
been
unable
to
track
him.
Before
the
outbreak
of
war
in
Kalamanda,
a
Demacian
soldier
who
had
publically
confessed
to
conspiracy
against
Noxus
by
order
of
Jarvan
IV
himself
was
mysteriously
assassinated.
He
was
found
dead
in
his
cell
shortly
after
his
confession,
a
victim
of
Nyzer
poisoning,
and
investigators
were
unable
to
find
any
evidence
left
behind
by
the
culprit.
Last
night,
however,
Demacian
representatives
received
an
anonymous
message
hinting
that
the
assassin
would
return
to
the
prison
to
retrieve
"evidence
left
undiscovered."
Garen,
the
Might
of
Demacia
himself,
led
a
group
of
responders
to
the
prison
shortly
before
midnight.
"The
assassination
of
Thom
Garvin
was
Noxus'
attempt
to
silence
him,"
stated
Garen.
"Demacia
will
take
every
measure
to
ensure
that
those
responsible
are
brought
to
justice."
At
the
prison,
the
small
Demacian
force
discovered
an
unidentified
intruder
searching
the
cells.
Garen
reportedly
ordered
the
man
to
stand
down,
but
a
fight
ensued
nonetheless.
"He
was
too
fast
with
his
blades,"
said
Elim
Relgar,
one
of
the
soldiers
present
at
the
scene.
"Only
Garen
could
match
him.
He
almost
had
the
intruder
cornered,
but
the
bastard
disappeared
right
out
from
under
us."
Following
the
fight,
investigators
searching
the
area
discovered
no
new
evidence
for
the
assassination
of
the
Demacian
prisoner.
However,
the
intruder
left
behind
several
daggers
and
a
torn
note,
pictured
above.
Thus
far,
the
content
of
the
note
has
yet
to
be
deciphered.
League
officials
in
Kalamanda
will
remain
on
watch
for
the
mysterious
individual
in
the
coming
days.
Garen
requested
that
a
small
group
of
Dauntless
Vanguard
join
their
patrol,
but
the
request
was
denied.
"We
have
allowed
small
groups
of
Noxian
and
Demacian
forces
to
oversee
the
extraction
process
and
the
construction
of
the
Crystal
Scar
provided
they
remember
one
thing:
the
war
is
over,"
stated
High
Councilor
Vessaria
Kolminye,
overseeing
the
League's
continued
presence
in
Kalamanda.
"The
League
will
continue
to
quell
any
action
that
could
result
in
renewed
violence."
Gragas
Partners
with
Singed
in
Business
Venture
Singed
Brewing
Co.
to
distribute
Graggy
Ice
in
the
city-state
of
Zaun
Cpt.
Morgan
Rackham
reporting
from
Zaun
The
rumor
mill
surrounding
Gragas,
the
Rabble
Rouser’s
arrival
in
Zaun
this
past
week
has
been
spinning
faster
than
a
dazed,
drunken
yordle
in
a
funhouse.
There
were
many
theories
flying
about,
all
of
them
absurd,
all
of
them
credible,
and,
ultimately,
all
of
them
wrong.
Some
said
that
he
was
here
in
town
to
look
for
inspiration
towards
his
latest
masterpiece
by
sampling
the
local
brews.
Others
theorized
that
he’d
heard
of
some
dangerous
new
mixture
and
was
here
to
drink
himself
under
the
table.
And
still
others
theorized
that
the
Noxian
guard
force
was
simply
a
bit
too
on
edge
for
him
to
fancy
a
visit
given
the
current
political
climate.
No
one,
it
seemed,
would
have
been
willing
to
believe
that
there
was
no
carousing
on
the
agenda
for
our
favorite
rambunctious
drunkard.
But
as
it
turns
out,
none
of
these
popular
rumors
had
landed
anywhere
close
to
the
mark.
Rather,
the
famed
brew
master
was
in
town
for
business,
not
pleasure.
Apparently,
back
at
the
Institute
of
War,
he
and
Singed
had
been
wheeling
and
dealing
over
distribution
rights
for
some
of
Gragas’
various
famed
concoctions.
Chairman
Stanwick
Pididily
was
less
interested
in
the
reason
for
Gragas’
arrival
and
more
interested
in
taking
measures
to
keep
him
from
laying
waste
to
the
city.
After
all,
during
a
previous
visitation,
it’s
been
said
that
the
famed
champion
of
the
League
inadvertently
started
one
of
the
worst
chemical
fires
in
recent
memory
by
upending
a
large
tank
of
industrial
coolant
he’d
mistaken
for
a
cask
of
beer
in
a
drunken
haze.
Three
corporate
properties
were
lost
in
the
wake
of
the
burnout,
including
the
warehouse
storing
fireworks
for
that
year’s
Snowdown
festivities
.
The
resulting
explosion
caused
a
city-wide
panic,
not
to
mention
spoiling
Snowdown
spirit
for
the
remainder
of
the
season.
While
Gragas’
coveted
concoctions
were
once
so
rare
they
were
only
attainable
through
the
efforts
of
the
most
well-to-do
connoisseurs,
it
appears
as
though
the
big
man
has
decided
to
go
global.
Naturally,
Zaun’s
position
on
the
mainland
along
with
its
well-established
chemical
industry
makes
it
a
natural
phase
one
in
his
distribution
plan.
They
say
Singed
is
already
in
the
process
of
refitting
some
of
his
substantial
factory
holdings
with
proper
liquor
stills
built
completely
to
the
specifications
of
his
new
business
partner.
But
the
Rabble
Rouser
himself
has
also
confirmed
that
he
has
appointments
to
set
up
brewing
operations
for
his
various
recipes
in
both
the
icy
northern
reaches
of
Freljord
and
back
down
in
my
old
stomping
grounds
of
Bilgewater
.
Raise
your
glass,
mates,
and
have
a
toast
to
Gragas
and
Singed!
The
next
time
you’re
ready
to
toss
one
back
in
Runeterra’s
famous
industrial
paradise,
you
might
be
able
to
call
for
whatever
the
Rabble
Rouser
himself
recommends!
An
exciting
thought
for
both
the
drunk
and
the
brave!

Senior
Summoner
Ralston
Farnsley
commenting
from
the
Institute
of
War
As
construction
of
the
Crystal
Scar
continues
in
Kalamanda,
life
in
Runeterra
has
returned
to
some
semblance
of
normalcy.
Though
tension
between
Noxus
and
Demacia
remains
high
at
the
Institute
of
War,
we
may,
for
the
first
time
in
months,
breathe
a
small
sigh
of
relief.
Without
further
ado,
dear
readers:
the
Mailbag
of
Justice.
“
Taric
draws
his
power
from
earth
magic
through
the
resonance
of
crystals
and
gems.
With
the
appearance
of
Skarner
whose
race
seems
to
share
a
similar
magical
link
to
crystals,
I
was
wondering
if
the
two
have
met
and
what
their
thoughts
are
on
each
other.”
–
Opacus02
Taric
is
a
very
reserved
member
of
the
League
of
Legends
and
usually
politely
declines
to
comment
in
the
Journal
of
Justice,
but
Skarner’s
emergence
and
arrival
at
the
Institute
of
War
did
indeed
catch
his
interest
enough
to
offer
you
this
response:
“I
have
come
across
many
kinds
of
magic
during
my
time
in
Runeterra.
Until
the
arrival
of
Skarner,
no
magic
in
this
land
has
struck
so
closely
to
that
of
my
home.
It
is
a
bit
presumptuous,
but
I
like
to
imagine
that
perhaps
our
worlds
share
a
deeper
connection
than
we
think.”
“I
have
a
question
for
Nocturne
.
If
I
do
recall
he
was
forced
to
work
for
the
League
because
he
tried
to
kill
many
summoners
.
It
must
be
hard
to
remain
in
a
world
where
you
were
forced
into
creation
from
dreams
before
to
a
harsh
reality.
So
my
question
to
Nocturne
is:
how
have
you
adapted
to
life
outside
of
dreams?”
–
Sarnok73
The
creature
called
Nocturne
is
kept
in
an
enchanted
holding
chamber
within
the
Institute
of
War.
His
deeply
ingrained
hatred
of
summoners
was
apparent
from
the
moment
I
approached:
the
room
darkened
unnaturally
and
Nocturne
slashed
his
blades
against
the
bars
that
divided
us.
I
offered
him
your
question,
and
at
first
I
believed
that
the
creature
would
refuse
to
answer,
but
Nocturne
cackled
and
hissed
his
disturbing
reply:
“Adapted?
I
am
a
prisoner
to
the
most
vicious
and
merciless
of
wardens.
You
summoners
imprison
and
enslave,
yet
I
am
the
one
called
nightmare.
I
will
never
‘adapt’—I
will
never
succumb
to
your
tyranny.
I
bide
my
time.
One
day,
I
will
show
you
a
true
nightmare,
summoners.”
“My
question
is
addressed
to
Wukong,
the
Monkey
King
.
Wukong,
you
have
said
yourself
that
your
dream
is
to
become
the
most
powerful
champion
in
the
Institute
of
War.
What
do
you
think
of
Jax,
the
Grandmaster
at
Arms
?
How
do
you
plan
on
becoming
the
best
when
Jax
stands
in
your
way?
Aren’t
you
nervous
to
face
him?
Do
you
truly
believe
that
you
can
surpass
the
mighty
Jax
and
his
lamp
post?”
–
J.
R.
In
the
time
since
he
joined
the
League
of
Legends,
Wukong
has
spent
a
great
deal
of
his
time
challenging
other
champions
at
the
Institute
of
War
to
friendly
duels
“to
get
to
know
them”
(as
he
puts
it).
He’s
certainly
brought
a
great
deal
of
action
to
the
sparring
pits
the
likes
of
which
haven’t
been
seen
here
in
quite
some
time—I
believe
there
are
many
here
who
have
felt
themselves
inspired
by
his
fighting
spirit,
and
Jax
is
certainly
included
there.
Ever-enthusiastic,
the
Monkey
King
was
eager
to
offer
you
a
response
to
your
question.
“Jax
is
tough,
and
he’s
always
ready
for
a
duel.
I
haven’t
beaten
him
one-on-one
outside
the
Field
of
Justice
quite
yet,
but
I’ve
gotten
close.
If
there’s
one
thing
I’ve
learned
from
Wuju
style,
though,
it’s
that
every
defeat
is
a
lesson.
I
can
learn
a
lot
from
the
Grandmaster
at
Arms.”
