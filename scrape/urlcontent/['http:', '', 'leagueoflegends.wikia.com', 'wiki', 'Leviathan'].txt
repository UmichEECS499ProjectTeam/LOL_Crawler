Leviathan
was
an
advanced
item
in
League
of
Legends
.

Recipe
Leviathan
{{{total}}}
gold
(800
gold)
Ruby
Crystal
475
gold
Notes
Leviathan
granted
820
total
health
at
20
stacks.
Health
was
valued
at
around
2.6
gold
per
point
at
basic
tier
.
The
item
would
begin
to
break
even
at
10
stacks,
a
few
more
if
you
were
comparing
it
to
advanced
and/or
legendary
items.

Trivia
True
damage
was
not
reduced
by
the
damage
reduction.
Leviathan
,
Mejai's
Soulstealer
,
and
Sword
of
the
Occult
were
a
trio
of
"
Snowball
Sister
Items"
that
shared
a
stack
feature
based
on
champion
kills/assists.
Even
at
20
stacks
Leviathan
did
not
give
the
most
health
of
any
item.
Leviathan
would
give
820
health
compared
to
Warmog's
Armor's
base
amount
of
1000.
The
15%
damage
reduction
increased
effective
health,
but
not
at
a
fixed
amount.
The
effective
health
granted
by
the
15%
reduction
increased
with
more
armor
/
magic
resist
,
where
0
armor/magic
resist
granted
17.6%
increase
while
100
armor/magic
resist
granted
35.3%
increase.
Due
to
how
the
damage
reduction
scaled,
it
was
more
efficient
on
champions
with
a
high
health
ratings.
Not
including
base
stats,
this
gave
a
fully
stacked
Leviathan
an
effective
health
of
965.
As
a
single
purchase
without
including
armor/magic
resist,
it
would
take
a
base
health
of
1733
for
a
fully
stacked
Leviathan
to
provide
an
effective
health
equal
to
a
fully
stacked
Warmog's
Armor
(at
1270
health).
Almost
all
champions
would
have
more
than
1733
health
by
level
18,
meaning
the
health
granted
by
a
fully
stacked
Leviathan
would
almost
always
outstrip
Warmog's
Armor
at
end
game.
The
stacking
buff
granted
by
Leviathan
when
a
kill
or
assist
was
scored
was
called
"Leviathan
Armor".
Giant's
Belt
cost
less
at
1110g,
and
provided
more
health
up
to
7
stacks.
If
one
has
a
Ruby
Crystal
and
the
upgrade
cost
of
800
gold,
selling
the
Ruby
Crystal
grants
a
total
of
1132
gold:
enough
to
buy
a
Giant's
Belt.
