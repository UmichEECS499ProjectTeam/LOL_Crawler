A
Normal
Game
is
the
most
played
type
of
PvP
match,
and
does
not
affect
Elo
.
The
reward
the
players
get
are
XP
and
IP
,
but
in
a
greater
amount
than
practice
games
.
A
summoner
can
invoke
any
available
champion
,
spells
,
mastery
trees
and
rune
pages
,
just
like
in
practice
games
.
Normal
games
can
be
played
solo
with
a
random
team,
or
with
1-4
others
in
a
premade.
The
random
team
mates
and
opponents
are
chosen
according
to
your
hidden
normal
Elo
-value.
Usually,
a
normal
game
lasts
20
to
60
minutes,
in
rare
cases
up
to
90,
and
cannot
be
paused,
so
before
starting
a
game
it
is
recommended
that
sufficient
time
is
allowed
to
complete
it.

Blind
Pick
Each
player
selects
a
champion
with
which
to
play.
This
simply
means
that
each
team
can
not
see
which
champions
the
other
has
picked
until
the
game
has
started.
Only
one
of
each
Champion
can
be
selected
on
each
team,
players
may
not
select
a
Champion
which
is
currently
selected
by
a
teammate
regardless
of
lock
status.
Draft
Mode
Draft
Mode
differs
from
Blind
Pick
in
the
following
ways.
This
model
of
champion
select
is
created
as
a
competitive
alternative
to
blind
pick
without
involving
the
visible
Elo
system.
Banning
Phase
:
At
the
start
of
champion
selection,
team
captains
have
the
opportunity
to
ban
a
total
of
6
champions.
The
bans
alternate
between
the
teams,
blue
team
starting.
During
the
banning
phase,
each
team
can
see
their
opponent's
available
champions
in
order
to
ban
viable
options.
Champion
Selection
:
The
team
that
receives
first
ban
gets
the
first
pick.
After
the
initial
pick,
teams
alternate
and
pick
two
at
a
time
until
each
champion
has
been
selected.
No
champion
can
be
selected
more
than
once
in
a
game.
Trade
:
When
all
the
members
of
a
team
have
locked
in,
there
is
an
opportunity
to
make
a
trade
within
your
team.
Both
members
of
the
team
must
own
both
champions
involved.
One
player
can
initiate
the
trade,
and
when
the
other
confirms
it
their
champions
are
swapped.
It
is
possible
to
execute
multiple
trades
before
the
game
begins.
Therefore,
trades
are
often
implemented
in
order
to
secure
high
tier
champions
early
on
to
be
swapped
with
the
intended
player
instead
of
risking
the
other
team
taking
them.
Fields
of
Justice
There
are
four
Fields
of
Justice
(Maps):
Summoner's
Rift
(Classic
5v5)
Twisted
Treeline
(Classic
3v3)
Crystal
Scar
(
Dominion
5v5)
Howling
Abyss
(
ARAM
5v5)
Effects
The
results
of
normal
games
count
towards
the
Summoner's
Win
/
Lose
/
Leaves
score.
Additionally,
your
Elo
is
changed
according
to
the
result,
you
earn
points
if
you
win
and
lose
some
if
you
lose.
The
number
of
Elo-points
you
gain
or
lose
is
calculated
by
an
unknown
formula,
taking
the
expected
result
due
to
the
Elo-values
of
all
participants
into
consideration.
