Trivia
This
was
one
of
the
4
auras
that
could
be
used
to
improve
champion
pets,
along
with
those
of
Aegis
of
the
Legion
,
Banner
of
Command
,
and
the
Captain
boot
enchant.
If
player
A
bought
a
Runic
Bulwark
and
player
B
bought
the
same
item
they
would
have
gotten
the
benefits
from
player
A
and
Player
B's
making
the
benefits
double
for
them,
their
allies
however
received
the
aura
only
once.
This
item
was
combined
with
Locket
of
the
Iron
Solari
,
but
the
armor
portion
of
the
aura
was
later
removed.
