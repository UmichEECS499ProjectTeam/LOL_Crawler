The
Summoner's
Code
is
a
compilation
of
rules
and
guidelines
that
Riot
Games
provide
to
the
players
to
abide
to
when
participating
in
competitive
play.
These
nine
patterns
of
behavior
were
the
ones
presented.

The
Patterns
of
Behavior
People
sometimes
ask
us
what
regulations
govern
the
League
of
Legends
community.
While
we
do
have
a
discrete
list
of
rules,
there's
a
lot
more
to
being
a
positive
force
in
the
community
than
adhering
to
the
legalese
set
down
in
our
Terms
of
Service.
We
believe
that
there
are
things
that
separate
a
great
player
from
one
who
is
mostly
concerned
with
not
violating
the
TOS.
And
you
may
be
surprised
to
find
out
that
we
believe
what
makes
a
player
great
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
your
summoner
level,
win/loss
ratio,
or
ranking.
What
makes
a
great
player
is
the
willingness
to
take
responsibility
for
ensuring
that
he
and
his
fellow
players
have
a
good
time.
And
so,
in
response
to
this
request
for
leadership,
we
here
at
Riot
Games
have
set
down
a
few
guidelines
for
becoming
one
of
these
great
players.
May
I
present,
The
Summoner's
Code!
Henceforth,
these
nine
patterns
of
behavior
shall
be
the
creed
that
governs
all
League
of
Legends
players
as
you
continue
to
fight
the
good
fight
out
there
on
the
Field
of
Justice:
[3]
Support
your
Team
"[Teamwork]
is
the
fuel
that
allows
common
people
to
attain
uncommon
results."
-
Andrew
Carnegie
While
we
all
carry
a
diverse
set
of
individual
ambitions
and
expectations
into
a
game
of
League
of
Legends,
once
we
hit
the
Field
we’re
a
part
of
a
team.
For
better
or
worse,
our
fates
are
intertwined
with
that
of
our
teammates.
Once
the
game
gets
into
full
swing,
you
have
to
make
a
choice
between
being
a
positive
force
for
your
team,
or
contributing
to
your
own
demise.
Being
a
good
team
player
begins
at
champion
select.
Be
open
minded
when
considering
the
needs
of
your
team.
If
you’re
the
last
one
to
pick,
try
to
fill
a
niche
in
your
team
that
hasn’t
already
been
filled.
If
everyone’s
picked
and
something
stands
out
as
a
deficiency
in
your
team
composition,
try
asking
for
another
player
to
fill
the
gap,
or
change
roles
to
embrace
that
responsibility
yourself.
Remember,
that
by
taking
on
a
role
you
don’t
normally
play,
you’ll
learn
more
about
unfamiliar
champions
and
increase
your
own
skill
level.
Once
you
get
in
game,
try
to
keep
an
open
line
of
communication.
Warn
your
teammates
if
someone
is
missing
from
your
lane,
or
if
something
is
placing
them
in
immediate
danger.
If
they’re
not
paying
attention
to
chat
you
can
always
try
pinging
the
map.
Just
remember
that
one
ping
is
enough!
Encourage
players
who
are
having
trouble,
and
congratulate
those
who
are
playing
well.
And
most
of
all,
if
you’re
having
a
bad
game
don’t
take
it
out
on
your
team!
Drive
Constructive
Feedback
"When
you
confront
a
problem
you
begin
to
solve
it."
-
Someone
Player
feedback
is
an
important
force
in
the
decision
making
process
of
Riot
Games.
If
you
want
to
make
your
voice
heard,
taking
the
time
to
let
us
know
how
you’re
feeling
about
the
game
is
a
good
place
to
start.
When
you
give
feedback,
make
sure
you
take
a
holistic
approach.
If
you
only
give
negative
feedback,
you
may
find
that
the
changes
you
influence
detract
from
what
you
initially
enjoyed.
Moreover,
people
are
simply
more
likely
to
listen
if
you
present
yourself
in
a
calm,
well
thought
out
manner.
That
being
said,
don't
be
afraid
to
tell
us
if
you
feel
strongly,
and
why.
Try
to
be
straightforward,
specific,
and
always
try
to
make
your
feedback
direct
and
concise.
For
instance,
saying
something
along
the
lines
of:
"I
used
to
love
playing
Katarina
because
her
skills
give
her
high
mobility
in
lane,
but
with
the
latest
nerfs
to
Death
Lotus,
I
no
longer
feel
like
I
have
a
strong
enough
presence
in
team
fights
to
be
viable.
I
don't
think
that
I'm
going
to
be
playing
Kat
in
the
future
unless
she
undergoes
some
revisions."
Is
a
much
better
way
of
expressing
your
dismay
at
a
patch
than
beginning
with
an
irate
tirade,
then
asking
for
changes
to
be
reverted
or
attempting
to
force
an
alternate
solution.
Remember
that
we’re
listening
and
making
changes
every
couple
of
weeks,
so
with
a
little
patience,
you
may
find
that
your
issues
will
work
themselves
out.
Facilitate
Civil
Discussion
"To
disagree,
one
doesn't
have
to
be
disagreeable."
-
Barry
Goldwater
As
we
mentioned
earlier,
we
want
you
to
give
feedback,
but
being
part
of
the
community
doesn’t
stop
there.
Whether
you’re
in
chat,
in
a
game,
or
on
the
forums,
there
are
plenty
of
people
to
meet,
and
plenty
of
topics
to
discuss.
Whether
you’re
discussing
game
balance
and
champion
viability,
trying
to
form
a
premade
team,
or
just
want
to
express
your
affection
for
the
legendary
and
infamous
Gentleman
Cho’Gath,
we
encourage
you
to
share
your
thoughts
with
other
players.
When
you
choose
to
participate
in
a
discussion
with
the
rest
of
the
playerbase,
always
try
to
be
receptive
to
another
player’s
point
of
view.
If
you
keep
an
open
mind,
you’d
be
surprised
what
valuable
information
you
can
glean
from
your
fellow
players.
Also,
be
mindful
of
how
you
present
your
point
of
view.
If
a
player
feels
strongly
on
a
subject,
don’t
get
caught
up
trying
to
have
the
last
word.
Just
state
your
side
and
exit
the
conversation
gracefully
rather
than
give
them
the
opportunity
to
pick
a
fight.
Enjoy
Yourself,
but
not
at
Anyone
Else’s
Expense
"Short
is
the
joy
that
guilty
pleasure
brings."
-
Euripides
Making
games
is
our
business,
so
it
should
come
as
no
surprise
that
we
want
you
to
have
a
lot
of
fun.
We
want
you
to
get
excited,
to
have
tension-filled
moments,
and
to
celebrate
your
success.
This
doesn’t
mean
that
we’re
okay
with
you
ruining
anybody
else’s
day.
Remember,
taking
a
jab
at
your
friend
in
the
middle
of
the
game
is
a
lot
different
than
making
a
glib
remark
at
a
complete
stranger.
Someone
who
is
unfamiliar
with
what
you
consider
playful
may
take
your
comment
as
an
attack
and
react
unfavorably.
If
two
players
on
a
team
start
fighting,
good
communication
and
teamwork
become
nearly
impossible.
Once
communication
breaks
down,
the
likelihood
of
victory
is
drastically
diminished.
It
isn’t
uncommon
for
simple,
good
natured
teasing
to
spiral
out
of
control
into
a
loss,
so
do
yourself
a
favor
and
don’t
run
the
risk
of
sabotaging
your
own
success.
Build
Relationships
"No
man
is
an
island..."
-
John
Donne
League
of
Legends
is
a
team
game,
and,
as
such,
familiarity
and
rapport
with
the
other
competitors
with
whom
you
play
is
going
to
be
a
big
part
of
your
success.
With
that
in
mind,
it
would
behoove
you
to
adopt
a
cordial
demeanor
and
attempt
to
make
friends.
If
you
have
fun
playing
with
another
player,
make
use
of
the
end
of
game
lobby
to
thank
that
player
for
the
game
and
send
a
friend
request.
The
more
friendly
players
that
you
have
at
your
disposal,
the
better
your
chances
are
of
getting
a
good,
friendly
game.
Also,
if
you
have
friends
who
you
think
might
be
a
good
fit
for
the
game
and
community,
don’t
hesitate
to
shoot
them
an
invite.
Not
only
will
you
earn
yourself
some
awesome
swag,
you’ll
have
more
friends
you
can
call
upon
when
you’re
having
trouble
flying
solo.
Use
the
tools
at
your
disposal
to
try
and
build
a
circle
of
other
players
of
a
similar
skill
level.
If
you
have
a
relationship
with
a
group
of
players
that
you
trust,
you
are
much
more
likely
to
get
good
feedback
on
how
you’re
playing,
receive
support
when
learning
a
new
champion,
and
just
have
a
good
time
overall.
Show
Humility
in
Victory,
and
Grace
in
Defeat
"To
be
humble
to
superiors
is
duty,
to
equals
is
courtesy,
to
inferiors
is
nobility."
-
Benjamin
Franklin
Having
a
great
game
is
a
one
of
the
biggest
joys
that
League
of
Legends
can
bring
you.
But
always
bear
in
mind
that
when
you’re
relishing
that
landslide
victory
there
is
someone
on
the
receiving
end
that
is
probably
ripping
their
hair
out.
While
it’s
alright
to
celebrate,
make
sure
that
you
keep
any
gloating
(or
any
other
mode
of
self-indulgence)
out
of
all
chat.
Instead,
thank
your
opponents
for
the
game.
After
all,
despite
their
best
efforts,
they
just
made
you
a
very
happy
person.
Moreover,
if
you’ve
just
lost,
avoid
pointing
any
fingers
or
deploying
excuses.
Even
if
you
had
a
great
game,
it’s
not
alright
to
blame
your
team.
You
had
five
opponents
in
that
game,
and
-
seeing
as
you
just
lost
-
chances
are
that
they
had
something
to
do
with
it.
We
all
know
that
losing
can
be
frustrating,
particularly
if
it’s
a
close
game
or
one
that’s
completely
one
sided,
but
nobody
likes
a
sore
loser.
Instead,
thank
your
opponents
for
the
game,
and
take
a
moment
at
the
end
of
game
screen
to
ask
what
you
could
have
done
better.
If
you’re
polite,
you
might
pick
up
a
few
pointers
that
can
help
you
counter
your
opponent’s
strategy
in
the
future.
Be
Resolute,
not
Indignant
"It
is
easier
to
find
men
who
will
volunteer
to
die,
than
to
find
those
who
are
willing
to
endure
pain
with
patience."
-
Julius
Caesar
Intrinsic
to
the
idea
of
competition
is
the
notion
that,
when
our
pride
is
on
the
line,
emotions
tend
to
run
high.
Every
person
that
we
encounter
is
going
to
carry
a
different
set
of
circumstances
with
them
into
the
game,
and
therefore
is
going
to
have
a
different
level
of
tolerance
for
frustration.
If
you
end
up
in
a
game
with
an
abusive
player,
don’t
lower
yourself
to
their
level.
Instead,
politely
ask
them
to
calm
down.
If
they’re
really
starting
to
bother
you,
the
mute
and
ignore
commands
are
always
there
to
resolve
the
situation.
And
remember,
while
nobody
likes
being
insulted,
it
pays
to
take
a
moment
to
consider
the
circumstances.
Remember
that
this
is
a
competitive
game,
and,
more
often
than
not,
the
other
player
is
just
venting
their
frustration.
Try
not
to
take
personally.
Everyone
has
a
breaking
point
and
everyone
rages
sometimes.
At
some
point
you
may
find
yourself
in
the
other
person’s
shoes.
Leave
No
Newbie
Behind!
"Be
an
opener
of
doors
for
such
as
come
after
thee."
-
Ralph
Waldo
Emerson
We
all
started
somewhere,
and
if
we’re
going
to
do
justice
to
the
people
who
helped
us
move
up
the
ladder,
we
have
to
start
by
paying
homage
to
our
roots.
If
you
see
a
player
having
a
bad
game,
or
who
clearly
doesn’t
grasp
the
fundamentals
of
the
genre,
try
offering
some
constructive
advice.
If
you
do
so
in
a
civil
and
friendly
manner,
it’s
likely
that
they
will
be
receptive.
Oftentimes
they’ll
be
downright
grateful
that
somebody
took
the
time
to
let
them
know
how
to
improve
instead
of
yelling
at
them.
Never
get
frustrated
by
an
inexperienced
player’s
performance.
At
some
point,
you
were
just
as
green
as
they
were,
even
if
it
was
the
day
that
you
downloaded
the
League
of
Legends
client.
Have
a
little
patience,
and
try
and
help
the
player
step
up
to
a
level
where
both
of
you
can
enjoy
the
game.
At
the
same
time,
don’t
be
discouraged
if
they
aren’t
receptive.
Some
small
percentage
of
players
will
get
hung
up
on
the
notion
that
they
don’t
need
anybody's
help,
and,
no
matter
how
politely
you
try
to
lend
a
hand,
they
won’t
want
to
hear
it.
That’s
no
reason
to
give
up
on
the
rest
of
them!
Lead
by
Example
"Leadership
is
practiced
not
so
much
in
words
as
in
attitude
and
in
actions."
-
Harold
S.
Geneen
If
you’re
like
us
and
you
share
a
vision
of
a
game
world
in
which
players
exercise
good
sportsmanship,
help
each
other
improve,
and
make
friends,
you’ve
got
to
start
living
the
dream
before
anybody
everybody
else
is
willing
to
do
so.
It’s
all
well
and
good
to
say
you’re
on
board
for
the
revolution,
but
if
you
don’t
first
make
yourself
a
paragon
of
model
behavior,
no
one
is
going
to
be
fooled.
Nobody’s
asking
you
to
be
perfect,
but
we
do
want
you
to,
whenever
possible,
strive
to
uphold
the
same
standards
of
behavior
that
you
expect
everyone
else
to
maintain.
