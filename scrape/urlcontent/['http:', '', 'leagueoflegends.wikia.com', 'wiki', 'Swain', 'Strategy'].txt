Skill
usage
Due
to
Carrion
Renewal
offering
mana,
and
Ravenous
Flock
offering
health,
Swain
can
potentially
stay
in
a
lane
for
a
very
long
time.
Note
that
Carrion
Renewal
cannot
hope
to
offset
the
massive
mana
cost
of
Ravenous
Flock,
and
his
ultimate
must
be
used
sparingly.
Combined
with
aggressive
lane
control,
it
is
recommended
Swain
takes
a
solo
lane
to
amass
gold
and
experience
.
Around
level
4,
you
will
have
gained
Swain's
full
combo.
Torment
and
Decrepify
followed
by
Nevermove
and
some
basic
attacks
will
devastate
unarmored
enemies.
If
you
are
too
far
for
his
other
two
abilities,
using
Nevermove
first
can
allow
you
to
close
the
distance.
Swain's
basic
abilities
each
have
different
benefits
when
leveled
and
maxed
over
the
others.
Decrepify
grants
moderate
damage
and
a
good
slowing
effect,
on
a
short
cooldown
and
good
range
.
Ensuring
foes
stay
trapped
in
the
tether
with
Nevermove
or
allied
disables
is
key.
Ranking
it
will
also
make
it
easier
to
land
Nevermove.
The
downside
is
that
you
are
either
forced
to
choose
between
safely
using
it
at
max
range,
thus
making
it
easier
to
break
the
tether,
or
going
in
closer
to
more
reliably
get
the
full
effect.
It
is
also
not
as
useful
when
your
jungler
initiates
a
gank,
because
the
enemy
has
a
better
chance
of
breaking
the
leash.
As
your
main
AoE
and
crowd
control
ability
in
one,
leveling
Nevermove
makes
it
more
usable
by
reducing
its
cooldown
significantly.
Alongside
the
damage
increase,
Swain's
farming/pushing
becomes
much
faster
and
easier,
and
the
snare
is
absolutely
amazing
for
countering
ganks
and
assisting
during
one
of
your
own.
However,
it
is
unreliable
against
enemy
champions
if
one
is
not
able
to
land
it
consistently,
and
if
they
predict
you
leveling
this
first,
they
can
grab
early
Boots
of
Speed
to
counter
the
ability
directly.
It
is
recommended
to
begin
ranking
this
skill
if
your
laning
is
going
absolutely
horribly,
and
you
do
not
believe
you
will
be
able
to
kill
your
enemy
during
laning
phase.
If
you
do
not
rank
it
and
you
are
behind,
the
enemy
will
be
able
to
outpush
you
and
you
will
lose
minions
to
your
turret.
By
itself,
Torment
offers
nice
harassment
at
a
low
mana
cost.
Even
at
low
levels,
you
can
take
off
2-3
bars
of
health
at
a
time
using
Torment
followed
by
autoattacks
against
a
squishier
champion.
In
combination
with
Ignite
,
Swain
can
provide
fatal
damage
output
early
on.
However
the
damage
dealt
by
Torment
alone
is
slightly
low,
while
your
unleveled
abilities
will
not
benefit
very
much
from
the
damage-amp
effect.
The
best
scenario
in
which
you
would
level
this
ability
first
is
against
a
squishy
target
that
is
more
susceptible
to
the
damage
from
it
and
Ignite
.
The
worst
case
is
against
targets
with
high
sustain
or
health.
While
laning,
try
to
gauge
the
strength
of
your
opponents
to
determine
the
right
balance
of
aggression
with
Ravenous
Flock
.
If
they're
stronger,
it
might
be
more
beneficial
to
stay
back
and
farm
and
counter-harass.
While
Swain
has
extreme
killing
potential,
his
main
counters
lie
in
targets
who
build
large
amounts
of
defence
as
well
as
having
built-in
sustain,
such
as
Cho'Gath
or
Nunu.
Swain's
exorbitant
mana
costs
mean
that
if
he
cannot
kill
his
target,
he
will
be
wasting
his
time
even
trying.
For
utility
purposes,
Decrepify
followed
by
Nevermove
makes
for
a
nearly
guaranteed
root.
The
time
taken
to
cast
Torment
can
cost
you
your
disables,
so
choose
based
on
the
situation.
Ravenous
Flock
is
not
channeled,
and
cannot
be
stopped
by
stuns,
silences,
or
any
form
of
crowd
control.
In
fact,
it
persists
during
the
Zhonyas
Hourglass
active
effect
(It
still
continues
to
drain
mana,
and
can
automatically
turn
off
during
the
active).
You
can
use
it
during
teamfights
to
drain
the
enemies'
health
,
as
well
as
restore
health
on
minions
after
the
fight.
With
extra
spell
vamp
and
a
Spirit
Visage
,
one
can
nearly
be
an
unstoppable
force.
You
should
still
be
wary
of
disables
preventing
you
from
stopping
the
spell,
especially
if
left
on
for
longer
durations;
those
few
seconds
more
can
quickly
deplete
your
mana
pool.
Be
cautious
when
using
Ravenous
Flock
to
farm,
as
it
opens
you
up
to
ganks,
as
you
will
have
no
survivability
beyond
trying
to
keep
one
enemy
away
with
Q->W.
While
escaping,
you
can
activate
Ravenous
Flock
,
as
it
will
heal
you
as
your
enemies
pursue
you.
This
can
be
very
effective
because
the
projectiles
prioritizes
champions
and
heals
yourself
75-88%
of
the
damage
dealt
to
them.
Healing
with
your
ultimate
while
throwing
down
your
slow
and
snare
gives
Swain
an
easy
escape.
The
best
combo
for
Swain
is
Torment
,
Ravenous
Flock
,
Decrepify
,
Nevermove
.
This
combo
is
especially
effective
against
melee
champions
near
creeps,
because
you
gain
health
from
the
creeps
while
you
engage
the
enemy
champion.
This
drains
your
mana
more
quickly
than
almost
any
champion,
however,
so
make
sure
to
buy
some
mana
items
to
fuel
your
combo.
If
Swain
is
doing
well,
giving
him
Crest
of
the
Ancient
Golem
can
greatly
increase
his
effectiveness,
and
even
if
he
is
doing
poorly,
the
buff
could
allow
him
to
make
a
comeback
or
at
least
get
back
on
level
ground
with
his
team
and
the
opposition.
With
all
the
control
and
healing
you
have
as
Swain
,
MR
is
inherently
more
important
and
useful.
This
is
because
almost
all
physical
damage
is
done
over
time,
which
your
healing
counters,
and
most
of
the
significant
physical
damage
is
put
off
by
squishy
carries,
who
are
almost
free
food
to
your
combo.
If
you
activated
Ravenous
Flock
when
engaging
an
enemy
remember
to
stop
the
spell
if
the
enemy
champion
escapes
out
of
your
range,
if
not
you
could
not
have
enough
mana
left
to
use
your
spells
when
you
reach
him
resulting
in
a
counterattack,
being
ganked,
or
allowing
the
enemy
to
escape.
A
good
harass
method
is
launching
Torment
immediately
after
casting
Nevermove
,
then
approach
and
launch
Decrepify
and
some
autoattacks
before
retreating,
this
combo
should
deal
around
40%-60%
of
a
squishy
enemy
champ's
health
leaving
him
vulnerable
to
a
final
combo
of
your
abilities.
Build
usage
Swain
is
very
mana
dependent
due
to
the
upkeep
costs
of
Ravenous
Flock
,
making
an
early
purchase
of
mana
sustain
such
as
Catalyst
the
Protector
or
Chalice
of
Harmony
very
useful
for
keeping
up
his
midgame
presence
alongside
Carrion
Renewal
.
Rod
of
Ages
is
practically
a
must
have
on
Swain,
granting
him
a
generous
helping
of
his
two
most
important
stats-
Ability
Power
and
Mana.
Its
passive
can
enable
him
to
stay
in
lane
for
as
long
as
he
requires,
and
when
levelling-up
during
close
fights
the
extra
mana
may
be
enough
to
squeeze
out
a
few
more
seconds
in
Ravenous
Flock.
In
addition,
its
Health
stat
works
with
any
armor
and
magic
resistance
Swain
might
buy,
improving
his
resistance
to
burst
damage.
Ignite
and
Deathfire
Grasp
can
provide
extra
burst
damage
due
to
the
20%
damage
increase
from
Torment
.
For
this
reason,
do
not
overlook
getting
a
Deathfire
Grasp
in
mid/late-game.
Swain
has
tankiness,
damage-over-time,
crowd
control
,
and
self-healing.
While
Swain
is
very
strong,
the
majority
of
his
damage
occurs
over
three
or
four
seconds,
which
is
usually
plenty
of
time
for
the
enemy
to
take
action.
Deathfire
Grasp
grants
him
the
ability
to
crush
single
targets
in
combination
with
Torment
.
Throwing
Torment
and
Ignite
on
a
dying-yet-retreating
enemy
will
almost
always
ensure
their
death,
even
if
they
are
healed
by
a
moderate
amount.
It
is
also
extremely
effective
to
throw
this
combo
on
a
squishy
carry
like
Caitlyn
at
the
start
of
a
team
fight.
The
damage
from
this
and
Swain's
other
abilities
is
usually
enough
to
put
them
into
a
retreat,
cutting
away
their
dps,
and
may
even
kill
them.
If
you
aren't
satisfied
with
the
one-hit-wonder
characteristic
of
the
DFG,
a
great
alternative
is
Morellonomicon
,
as
it
provides
greater
amounts
of
the
same
stats
without
the
restrictive
active
effect.
A
Swain
build
that
is
centered
more
around
teamfighting
and
staying
alive
is
Will
of
the
Ancients
,
Rod
of
Ages
,
and
Spirit
Visage
.
With
a
build
initialized
by
these
items,
building
AP
directly
translates
into
more
healing,
which
in
turn
allows
for
more
damage.
After
these
items,
it
would
be
wise
to
build
Rabadon's
Deathcap
,
and
Zhonya's
Hourglass
to
provide
massive
AP
and
the
invulnerability
of
Zhonya's
Hourglass
.
This
build
is
perfect
for
protecting
your
carry
and
being
an
anti-carry
yourself.
As
almost
all
of
Swain's
skills
rely
on
positioning,
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
can
be
invaluable
to
keep
foes
in
range
of
Decrepify
and
Ravenous
Flock
,
and
ensure
landing
Nevermove
.
As
all
of
his
spells
are
either
DoT
or
AoE,
however,
it
will
only
apply
the
15%
slow,
making
the
item
less
efficient.
But
it
gives
a
slow
to
Torment
in
the
front
of
the
spell
combo
when
bursting
enemy
carries.
Ravenous
Flock
works
through
the
active
component
of
Zhonya's
Hourglass
,
allowing
Swain
to
use
it
for
up
to
6
ticks'
worth
of
damage
and
healing.
With
the
recent
buff
to
its
aura,
Abyssal
Scepter
becomes
an
extremely
viable
item
on
Swain's
once
again,
as
all
of
his
abilities
save
his
W
fall
within
the
aura
range.
Take
if
you
need
some
MR,
or
if
the
enemy's
building
some,
though
if
they
start
building
too
much
you
may
have
to
switch
out
for
a
Void
Staff
instead.
Tear
of
the
Goddess
is
a
viable
item
for
mana
sustain
because
Ravenous
Flock
will
increase
the
max
mana.
When
recalling,
activating
the
ability
will
grant
from
20
to
50
bonus
mana.
Upgrading
it
in
Archangel's
Staff
will
greatly
increase
the
mana
sustain
and,
due
to
Ravenous
Flock
,
also
the
life
sustain.
Zhonya's
Hourglass
is
one
of
Swain's
most
core
items:
the
120AP
is
very
much
appreciated,
the
armour
allows
him
to
fulfil
his
role
of
wading
into
fights
and
draining
health
with
Ravenous
Flock
,
and
most
importantly
of
all,
he
has
perhaps
the
best
synergy
with
the
active
of
any
champion
in
the
game,
as
his
Ravenous
Flock
's
life-drain
continues
to
work
through
the
stasis
(assuming
you
have
the
mana
for
the
upkeep
cost),
allowing
him
to
pop
it
and
just
steal
health
for
2
seconds
while
invulnerable.
Liandry's
Torment
can
be
effective
on
swain
as
it
gives
magic
penetration,
moderate
AP,
minor
health
increases
and
his
moderate
CC/AOE
from
his
kit
(especially
when
paired
with
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
)
have
decent
synergy
with
it's
passive.
If
the
enemy
team
has
a
lot
of
melee
champions
or
has
multiple
ranged
ADCs,
a
Sunfire
Cape
or
Thornmail
works
for
him
as
he
has
to
wade
into
the
center
of
the
fray
when
he
use's
his
ult.
This
is
not
a
good
choice
in
other
situations
as
this
decreases
your
item
choices
for
AP/Mana.

Countering
Swain
mostly
deals
magic
damage,
investing
in
magic
resistance
will
mitigate
his
damage.
Do
not
underestimate
Swain's
damage;
although
he
only
has
one
burst
skill
in
Nevermove
,
he
can
dish
out
massive
damage
over
time
if
you
allow
him
to.
If
you
believe
that
you
will
be
able
to
survive
Swain's
initial
4
seconds
of
damage,
such
as
due
to
your
own
high
lifesteal
stat,
(as
well
as
outdamage
his
ultimate's
healing)
you
may
be
able
to
tank
his
damage
and
turn
the
fight
when
he
is
waiting
for
cooldowns.
High
movement
speed
and
good
mobility
counters
most
of
Swain's
spells.
When
Decrepify
is
cast,
quickly
break
the
tether
by
moving
away
from
the
bird.
Avoid
getting
hit
by
Swain's
Nevermove
to
remove
a
large
part
of
his
damage
combo.
Move
away
from
Swain
if
he
uses
his
Ravenous
Flock
.
This
will
waste
his
mana
and
force
him
to
put
it
on
cooldown.
Attacking
Swain
right
after
he
cancels
Ravenous
Flock
is
the
best
time
to
attack
him.
Get
out
of
his
spell
range
when
you
are
in
effect
of
his
Torment
as
you
will
take
more
damage
while
affected
by
Torment
.
When
his
birds
target
you,
his
ultimate
will
also
heal
him
more.
Use
healing
reduction
effects
such
as
Ignite
or
the
passive
from
Executioner's
Calling
or
Morellonomicon
to
prevent
him
from
healing
a
lot
of
damage
from
his
Ravenous
Flock
.
This
strips
Swain
of
his
primary
survivability
mechanism
and
makes
him
much
easier
to
focus
and
kill.
If
you
notice
Swain
purchasing
a
Quicksilver
Sash
,
it
may
be
a
better
idea
to
use
Ignite
on
another
target
to
avoid
wasting
it.
Quicksilver
Sash
can
save
you
from
a
well-placed
Nevermove
.
