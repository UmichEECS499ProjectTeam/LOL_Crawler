Death
Recap
League
of
Legends
now
includes
Death
recap
,
a
helpful
feature
for
both
new
and
veteran
players
alike,
which
shows
the
major
sources
of
damage
that
led
to
a
Champion's
demise.
When
a
player's
champion
has
been
slain,
the
player
can
open
the
Death
recap
window
which
will
summarize
all
of
the
fatal
damage
they
received
during
their
final
moments.
The
Death
recap
window
not
only
provides
informative
tips
on
how
to
avoid
being
killed
by
the
same
champion
and
spells
again,
but
also
displays
the
items
the
killing
and
assisting
Champions
have,
and
the
stats
of
those
items.
The
fatal
damage
taken
is
broken
down
on
an
integer
and
percentage
basis,
so
that
players
can
have
a
complete
and
thorough
understanding
of
exactly
how
they
were
taken
down.
