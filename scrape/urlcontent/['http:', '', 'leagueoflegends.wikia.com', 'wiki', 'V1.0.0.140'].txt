V1.60
Changes
to
normal
draft
mode
were
not
implemented
and
were
deployed
with
V1.0.0.141
.
Normal
Draft
Mode:
Normal
draft
has
changed
so
that
premade
groups
are
not
prioritized
over
solo
players.
Solo
players
have
a
20%
chance
of
being
the
team
captain
with
banning
powers
and
first
pick,
regardless
of
the
premade
status
of
the
rest
of
the
team.
If
a
solo
player
is
not
team
captain,
the
player
will
be
given
a
random
slot
in
the
pick
order.
If
players
group
up
before
a
game,
their
host
absorbs
all
of
their
chances,
i.e.
the
host
of
a
4-man
premade
has
an
80%
chance
to
be
captain.
Ranked
Solo/Duo
Queue
The
Free
to
Play
rotation
has
been
removed
from
Ranked
Solo/Duo
Queue.
Unlocked
champions
that
appear
on
the
Free
to
Play
rotation
will
still
be
playable.
You
may
now
rename
your
buddy
groups
by
double-clicking
the
name
of
the
group.
Fixed
a
bug
where
some
buddies
would
appear
to
be
level
0
with
no
information.
Fixed
a
bug
where
the
sound
at
the
end
of
champion
select
would
play
too
loudly.
Fixed
a
bug
where
swap
offers
in
champion
select
would
persist
into
your
next
game.
