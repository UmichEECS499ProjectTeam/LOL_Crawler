Redirected

Dodge

"You

a
museum!"
The
subject
of
this
article
was
removed
from
League
of
Legends
.
The
information
displayed
is
no
longer
relevant
to
League
of
Legends,
but
exists
here
for
historical
purposes.
Dodge
was
a
champion
statistic
that
granted
a
champion
a
percentage
chance
to
completely
ignore
an
autoattack
from
an
aggressor.
Dodge
was
gradually
removed
from
the
game
as
a
global
champion
statistic
from
patches
V1.0.0.124
through
V1.0.0.132
.

Calculations
The
dodge
formula
was
a
multiplicatively
cumulative
formula.
By
default,
each
champion
has
a
dodge
modifier
of
100,
meaning
they
will
be
hit
by
every
physical
attack
directed
at
them.
Sources
that
modify
the
dodge
stat
are
multiplied
in
sequence,
reducing
the
previous
dodge
modifier
by
the
given
percentage.
This
means
that
each
increase
in
the
dodge
chance
has
less
of
an
impact
on
the
total
dodge
modifier.
If
a
champion
wears
an
item
that
increases
dodge
chance
by
10%,
their
dodge
modifier
will
be
90%
of
100,
or
90
(10%
of
physical
attacks
are
dodged).
If
the
champion
buys
a
second
such
item,
their
dodge
modifier
will
be
90%
of
90,
or
81
(19%
of
attacks
are
dodged),
not
80%
of
100.
In
short
the
formula
is:
where
the
variables
a,
b,
c,
and
n
are
the
dodge
%
values
and
are
converted
to
their
respective
decimal
values.
In
calculating
the
dodge
modifier,
dodge
chance
from
all
runes
are
added
together
and
treated
as
one
source,
with
every
mastery,
champion
ability,
and
individual
items
added
as
additional
sources
after
that.
