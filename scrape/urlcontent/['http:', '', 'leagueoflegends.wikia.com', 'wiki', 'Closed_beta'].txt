beta
Beta
test
is
the
software
development
phase
following
alpha
(beta
is
the
second
letter
of
the
ancient
Greek
alphabet,
used
as
the
number
2.
It
is
not
nowadays
usual
to
speak
of
a
later
gamma
test).
While
in
the
Beta
stage,
a
software
is
generally
functional
but
many
features
are
either
missing
or
incomplete.
The
focus
of
beta
testing
is
reducing
the
impact
of
glitches
and
bugs
to
users
when
the
game
is
released
publicly,
and
often
incorporates
usability
testing
.
The
process
of
delivering
a
beta
version
to
the
users
is
called
beta
release
and
this
is
typically
the
first
time
that
the
software
is
available
outside
of
the
organization
that
developed
it.
In
League
of
Legends
,
beta
testing
went
trough
two
different
phases:
From
April
2009
to
October
21st,
2009
the
game
was
in
closed
beta
testing,
in
which
only
users
that
got
an
invite
were
able
to
participate.
Every
user,
including
newly
registered
ones,
had
5
invites
at
their
disposal.
Additionally,
a
beta
key
was
granted
to
every
fan
of
League
of
Legends
on
Facebook
when
it
reached
40,000
fans.
At
the
end
of
this
stage,
every
account
was
reset
to
Level
1
but
received
an
exclusive
King
Rammus
skin
as
a
gift.
On
October
21st,
2009,
League
of
Legends
entered
Open
Beta,
where
anyone
could
try
out
the
game.
Open
Beta
only
lasted
1
week,
ending
on
October
27,
2009
when
League
of
Legends
was
officially
launched.
