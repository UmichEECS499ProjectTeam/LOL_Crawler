Trivia
Rammus
was
designed
by
Guinsoo
,
Ezreal
and
Coronach
.
[1]
The
title
"Armordillo"
is
a
play
on
the
words
"Armor"
and
"Armadillo"
-
"Armadillo"
is
Spanish
for
"little
armored
one".
The
name
"Rammus"
may
be
a
homophone
or
pun
of
a
combination
of
the
words
"Ram"
and
"Us".
Through
a
combination
of
Powerball
,
summoner
spells,
allied
abilities,
runes
,
masteries
,
and
items
,
it
is
possible
for
Rammus
to
achieve
speeds
of
well
over
5000
movement
speed
.
Rammus
was
one
of
the
champions
chosen
for
the
Noxian
pool
available
during
the
Ionia
vs.
Noxus
match
.
He
was
the
ban
choice
for
Ionia
.
Despite
Rammus's
naturally
low
health,
Rammus
is
the
only
champion
to
currently
have
a
health
rating
of
100.
Rammus
has
the
highest
Base
Armor
out
of
all
Champions,
21
Armor
with
+3.8
growth.
Quotes
Rammus
is
the
only
champion
without
a
joke
in
the
English
client.
In
French,
German,
Spanish,
Polish
and
Italian
translations,
Rammus
has
the
whole
set
of
dialogue
with
taunts
and
jokes.
Rammus
has
the
least
amount
of
quotes,
numbering
at
6.
Rammus
'
quote
"Ok"
is
a
very
popular
League
of
Legends
meme.
When
Rammus
is
ordered
to
attack,
his
tone
changes.
Skins
King
Rammus
is
a
reference
to
Bowser
from
the
Mario
franchise,
and
was
only
available
to
closed
beta
participants.
Ninja
Rammus
may
be
a
reference
to
The
Teenage
Mutant
Ninja
Turtles
,
specifically
Raphael
due
to
the
two
Sai
he
wields.
The
live
Vayne
preview
included
a
peek
at
Ninja
Rammus
.
Molten
Rammus
has
him
on
fire
when
using
the
Powerball
ability,
leaving
a
short
trail
of
fire
while
he's
traveling.
This
is
purely
cosmetic
and
does
no
damage.
Chrome
Rammus
is
theorized
to
be
a
part
of
a
set
of
4
skins
which
reference
internet
browsers.
The
skins
Foxfire
Ahri
,
Safari
Caitlyn
and
Explorer
Ezreal
are
the
other
three.
Full
Metal
Rammus
is
possibly
a
reference
to
the
Droideka
,
or
destroyer
droid,
from
the
Star
Wars
franchise.
In
the
background
of
the
skin's
splash
art,
a
silhouette
of
what
appears
to
be
a
robotic
Soraka
can
be
seen.
This
is
possibly
a
reference
to
her
occasionally
being
called
a
"Heal
Bot"
or
perhaps
an
upcoming
skin.
Rammus
shares
a
Full
Metal
theme
with
Pantheon
and
Jayce
,
as
a
member
of
the
Resistance
.
Relations
In
the
Journal
of
Justice
,
it
was
stated
that
Rammus
is
close
friends
with
Blitzcrank
,
having
a
similar
good
nature
to
them.
According
to
Blitzcrank's
"Fleshling
Compatability
Service",
a
dating
service
made
by
Blitzcrank,
Rammus'
best
match
is
a
cactus.
It
is
stated
in
the
Journal
of
Justice
that
Rammus
and
Twitch
do
not
get
along
with
each
other.
