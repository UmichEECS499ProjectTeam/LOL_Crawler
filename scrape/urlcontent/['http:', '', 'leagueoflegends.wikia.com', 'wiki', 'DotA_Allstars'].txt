Defense
of
the
Ancients
(
DotA
)
is
a
custom
mod
for
Warcraft
III
,
based
on
the
"Aeon
of
Strife"
map
for
StarCraft
.
The
objective
of
the
scenario
is
to
destroy
the
opponents'
"Ancient".
The
two
teams'
Ancients
are
heavily
guarded
structures
at
opposing
corners
of
the
map.
Players
use
powerful
units
known
as
heroes,
and
are
assisted
by
allied
heroes
and
AI-controlled
fighters
called
"creeps".
As
in
role-playing
games,
players
level
up
their
hero
and
use
gold
to
buy
equipment
during
the
mission.
The
scenario
was
developed
with
the
"World
Editor"
of
Warcraft
III:
Reign
of
Chaos
,
and
was
updated
upon
the
release
of
the
Warcraft
III:
The
Frozen
Throne
.
There
have
been
many
variations
of
the
original
concept;
currently,
the
most
popular
is
DotA:
Allstars
,
which
has
been
maintained
by
several
authors
during
development.
Since
its
release,
Allstars
has
become
a
feature
at
several
worldwide
tournaments,
including
Blizzard
Entertainment's
BlizzCon
and
the
Asian
World
Cyber
Games,
as
well
as
the
Cyberathlete
Amateur
and
CyberEvolution
leagues;
Gamasutra
declared
that
DotA
was
perhaps
the
most
popular
"free,
non-supported
game
mod
in
the
world."
[1]
The
map
has
gone
on
to
influence
other
maps
and
games,
including
the
strategy
game
League
of
Legends
and
its
very
own
stand-alone
sequel
Dota
2
.

Gameplay
Defense
of
the
Ancients
pits
two
teams
of
players
against
each
other:
the
Sentinel
and
the
Scourge.
Players
on
the
Sentinel
team
are
based
at
the
southwest
corner
of
the
map,
and
those
on
the
Scourge
team
are
based
at
the
northeast
corner.
Each
base
is
defended
by
towers
and
waves
of
units
which
guard
the
main
paths
leading
to
their
base.
In
the
center
of
each
base
is
the
"Ancient",
a
building
that
must
be
destroyed
to
win
the
game.
Each
human
player
controls
one
hero,
a
powerful
unit
with
unique
abilities.
In
Allstars
,
players
on
each
side
choose
one
of
one-hundred
and
ten
heroes,
each
with
different
abilities
and
tactical
advantages
over
other
heroes.
The
scenario
is
highly
team-oriented;
it
is
difficult
for
one
player
to
carry
the
team
to
victory
alone.
Nevertheless,
some
heroes,
given
enough
time,
can
change
the
outcome
single-handedly,
while
countering
the
opposing
team's
heroes.
Defense
of
the
Ancients
allows
up
to
ten
players
in
a
five
versus
five
format
and
an
additional
two
slots
for
referees
or
observers,
often
with
an
equal
number
of
players
on
each
side.
Because
the
gameplay
revolves
around
strengthening
individual
heroes,
it
does
not
require
one
to
focus
on
resource
management
and
base-building,
as
in
most
traditional
real-time
strategy
games.
Killing
computer-controlled
or
neutral
units
earns
the
player
experience
points;
when
enough
experience
is
accumulated,
the
player
gains
a
level.
Leveling
up
improves
the
hero's
toughness
and
the
damage
it
can
inflict,
and
allows
players
to
upgrade
their
spells
or
skills.
In
addition
to
accumulating
experience,
players
also
manage
a
single
resource:
gold.
The
typical
resource
gathering
of
Warcraft
III
is
replaced
by
a
combat-oriented
money
system;
in
addition
to
a
small
periodic
income,
heroes
earn
gold
by
killing
hostile
units,
base
structures,
and
enemy
heroes.
Using
gold,
players
buy
items
to
strengthen
their
hero
and
gain
abilities.
Certain
items
can
be
combined
with
recipes
to
create
more
powerful
items.
Buying
items
that
suit
one's
hero
is
an
important
tactical
element
of
the
scenario.
Allstars
offers
a
variety
of
game
modes,
selected
by
the
game
host
at
the
beginning
of
the
match.
The
game
modes
dictate
the
difficulty
of
the
scenario,
as
well
as
whether
people
can
choose
their
hero
or
are
assigned
one
randomly.
Many
game
modes
can
be
combined
(for
example,
an
easy
difficulty
level
and
a
random
hero
pick),
allowing
more
flexible
options.
Development
The
first
version
of
Defense
of
the
Ancients
was
released
in
2003
by
a
mapmaker
under
the
alias
Eul,
who
based
the
map
on
a
previous
StarCraft
scenario
known
as
"Aeon
of
Strife",
After
the
release
of
Warcraft
III:
The
Frozen
Throne
,
which
added
new
features
to
the
World
Editor,
Eul
did
not
update
the
scenario.
Other
mapmakers
produced
spinoffs
that
added
new
heroes,
items,
and
features.
Among
the
DotA
variants
created
in
the
wake
of
Eul's
map
included
Allstars
,
developed
by
modder
Steve
Feak
(under
the
alias
Guinsoo);
this
version
would
become
the
most
popular
version
of
the
map.
Feak
said
when
he
began
developing
Allstars
he
had
no
idea
how
popular
the
game
would
eventually
become;
the
emerging
success
of
the
gametype
inspired
him
to
design
a
new
title
around
what
he
considered
an
emerging
game
genre.
Feak
added
a
recipe
system
for
items
so
that
player's
equipment
would
scale
as
they
grew
more
powerful,
as
well
as
a
powerful
boss
character
called
Roshan
(named
after
his
bowling
ball)
who
required
an
entire
team
to
defeat.
Steve
"Pendragon"
Mescon
created
a
community
site,
dota-allstars.com,
in
2004
to
replace
the
battle.net
channel
Feak
created
to
provide
a
place
for
DotA
players
to
congregate.
Towards
the
end
of
his
association
with
the
map,
Feak
primarily
worked
on
optimizing
the
map
before
handing
over
control
to
another
developer
after
version
6.01.
The
new
author,
IceFrog,
added
new
features,
heroes,
and
fixes.
Each
release
is
accompanied
with
a
changelog.
IceFrog
is
known
for
being
notoriously
reclusive,
refusing
to
give
interviews;
the
only
evidence
of
IceFrog's
authorship
is
the
map
maker's
email
account
on
the
official
website
and
the
name
branded
on
the
game's
loading
screen.
Defense
of
the
Ancients
has
strong
community
support,
now
maintained
via
official
forums.
Users
can
post
ideas
for
new
heroes
or
items,
some
of
which
are
added
to
the
map.
Players
have
contributed
icons
and
hero
descriptions
and
created
the
artwork
displayed
while
the
map
loads,
and
suggestions
for
changes
to
existing
heroes
or
items
are
taken
seriously;
IceFrog
once
changed
a
new
hero
less
than
two
weeks
after
the
new
version
of
the
map
was
released.
Versions
of
the
scenario
where
enemy
heroes
are
controlled
by
artificial
intelligences
have
also
been
released.
Because
Warcraft
III
custom
games
have
none
of
the
features
designed
to
improve
game
quality
(matchmaking
players
based
on
connection
speed,
etc.),
various
programs
are
used
to
maintain
Defense
of
the
Ancients
.
External
tools
ping
player's
locations,
and
games
can
be
named
to
exclude
geographic
regions.
REFG
Clans
and
committees
such
as
Team
DotA
Allstars
(TDA)
maintain
their
own
official
list
of
rules
and
regulations,
and
players
can
be
kicked
from
matches
by
being
placed
on
"banlists".
Reception
and
legacy
The
popularity
of
Defense
of
the
Ancients
has
increased
over
time.
The
scenario
was
featured
by
Computer
Gaming
World
in
a
review
of
new
maps
and
mods
in
Warcraft
III
.
DotA
Allstars
became
an
important
tournament
scenario,
starting
with
its
prominence
at
the
debut
of
Blizzard's
BlizzCon
convention
in
2005.
Defense
of
the
Ancients
was
included
in
the
game
lineup
for
the
internationally
recognized
Cyberathlete
Amateur
League
and
CyberEvolution
leagues.
Additionally,
the
scenario
appeared
in
Electronic
Sports
World
Cup
(ESWC)
2008,
Oliver
Paradis,
ESWC's
competition
manager,
noted
that
the
high
level
of
community
support
behind
the
scenario,
as
well
as
its
worldwide
appeal,
were
among
the
reasons
it
was
chosen.
Defense
of
the
Ancients
has
been
credited
as
one
of
the
influences
for
the
2009
Gas
Powered
Games
title
Demigod
,
with
the
video
game
publication
GameSpy
noting
the
game's
premise
revolved
around
aspiring
gods
"[playing]
DotA
in
real
life".
Guinsoo
went
on
to
apply
many
of
the
mechanics
and
lessons
he
learned
from
Defense
of
the
Ancients
to
the
Riot
Games
title
League
of
Legends
.
Other
DotA-based
games
include
Valve's
Dota
2
(a
direct
port
of
the
original
Defense
of
the
Ancients
)
and
S2
Games'
Heroes
of
Newerth
.
Blizzard
Entertainment
is
also
developing
a
free
mod
for
StarCraft
II:
Heart
of
the
Swarm
entitled
Heroes
of
the
Storm
,
featuring
an
array
of
heroes
from
Blizzard's
franchises.
