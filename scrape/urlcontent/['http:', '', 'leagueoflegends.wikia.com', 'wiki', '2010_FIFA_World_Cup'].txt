The

Thirty-two

via
a
worldwide

tournament
that

In

of

in

proceeding.
These
sixteen

advanced
to
the

where
three

decided
which

would
participate
in
the
final.
In
the

the
European
champions,
defeated
third-time
finalists
the
Netherlands
1–0
after
extra
time,
with
Andrés
Iniesta's
goal
in
the
116th
minute
giving
Spain
their
first
world
title,
becoming
the
eighth
nation
to
win
the
tournament,
and
the
first
European
nation
to
win
the
tournament
outside
its
home
continent.
