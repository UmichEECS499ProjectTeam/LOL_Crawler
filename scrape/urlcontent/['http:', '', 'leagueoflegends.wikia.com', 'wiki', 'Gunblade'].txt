Trivia
Hextech
Gunblade
is
the
only
item
in
the
League
of
Legends
which
grants
both
life
steal
and
spell
vamp
,
excluding
the
passive
effect
for
Guinsoo's
Rageblade
which
triggers
when
the
champion
falls
below
50%
health.
Similarly,
Hextech
Gunblade
is
along
with
Guinsoo's
Rageblade
and
Trinity
Force
one
of
the
only
items
that
grant
both
attack
damage
and
ability
power
The
Gunblade
is
a
recurring
weapon
in
the
Final
Fantasy
franchise,
first
appearing
in
Final
Fantasy
VIII
.
Hextech
Gunblade's
active
heals
you
with
the
spell
vamp
it
provides,
synergizing
with
itself.
Hextech
Gunblade
improves
Bilgewater
Cutlass's
active
ability's
cast
range
from
450
to
700
and
causes
the
magic
damage
dealt
to
scale
with
your
ability
power.
Using
a
Runaan's
Hurricane
gives
you
the
potential
to
take
9
seconds
off
of
the
active's
cooldown
with
every
auto
attack
if
the
extra
bolts
also
hit
enemy
champions.
