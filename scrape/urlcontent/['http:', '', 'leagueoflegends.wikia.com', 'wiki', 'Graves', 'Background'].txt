Champion
Malcolm
Graves
was
born
in
the
back
of
a
Bilgewater
tavern
and
left
there
with
a
bottle
of
spiked
milk.
He
survived
a
childhood
in
the
pirate-run
slums
using
every
dirty
trick
in
the
book.
Intent
on
building
a
new
life
for
himself,
he
stowed
away
on
the
first
ship
to
the
mainland
he
could
sneak
aboard.
However,
the
grim
realities
of
the
world
forced
him
to
eke
out
an
unsavory
living
in
the
underground
of
various
city-states,
jumping
the
border
whenever
things
got
too
hot.
At
a
particularly
high-stakes
game
of
cards,
he
found
himself
seated
opposite
Twisted
Fate
.
They
both
flipped
four
aces
on
the
final
hand.
It
was
the
first
time
either
conman
had
met
his
equal.
The
two
formed
an
alliance,
swindling
marks
at
the
tables
and
scrapping
back-to-back
in
the
alleys
afterward.
Together,
they
ran
the
streets
–
stacking
chips,
decks,
and
rap
sheets.
Unfortunately
Graves
made
the
mistake
of
hustling
a
hefty
sum
from
Dr.
Aregor
Priggs,
a
high-ranking
Zaunite
official
and
businessman.
When
Priggs
discovered
how
he'd
been
played,
he
became
obsessed
with
revenge.
He
learned
about
Twisted
Fate's
all-consuming
desire
to
control
magic
and
he
promptly
offered
him
a
trade:
serve
Graves
up
in
exchange
for
enrollment
in
a
procedure
which
would
grant
his
wish.
Twisted
Fate
took
the
deal
–
both
he
and
Graves
knew
the
stakes
of
their
arrangement,
but
the
offer
was
too
good.
Once
acquired,
Priggs
had
Graves
taken
to
a
special
location
built
to
hold
men
whose
crimes
–
or
more
precisely
their
punishments
–
were
meant
to
stay
off
the
books.
Graves
endured
years
of
captivity
at
the
hands
of
Zaun's
wardens
before
he
managed
to
escape.
One
of
his
fellow
detainees
introduced
him
to
an
eccentric
gunsmith
who
modified
a
shotgun
exactly
to
his
specifications.
He
named
it
"Destiny."
After
he
paid
a
visit
to
Priggs,
Graves
joined
the
League
of
Legends
with
two
targets
in
his
sights:
Twisted
Fate
and
payback.
“They
got
a
saying
in
the
locker:
ain’t
got
nothin’
but
time
to
plan."
―
Graves,
the
Outlaw

CLE
OBSERVATION
Malcolm
Graves
is
the
picture
of
resilience.
His
body,
a
checkerboard
of
scars
and
cracked
calluses,
remains
fit
despite
his
age.
His
expression
is
grim,
determined.
He
carries
an
oversized
shotgun
in
one
hand.
Its
weight
is
irrational
for
its
function,
but
it
complements
him
well.
However,
the
real
story
lies
in
his
eyes.
They
seem
stubbornly
fixed
on
something
beyond
his
vision,
something
unachievable,
some
goal
that
has
always
remained
slightly
out
of
reach.
Nothing
will
steer
him
from
his
course.
It’s
as
though
he
has
pursued
the
carrot-on-a-stick
for
so
long
that,
even
though
he
learned
the
trick,
it’s
all
he
knows
how
to
do
anymore.
REFLECTION
Same
old
song
and
dance,
Graves
thought.
Couple
of
big
wigs
trying
to
put
on
a
show.
Graves
wasn’t
one
for
theatrics.
He
preferred
to
keep
most
of
his
social
interactions
12-gauge
and
below.
Things
hadn’t
always
been
this
way.
Once
upon
a
time,
he
genuinely
delighted
in
the
game,
fleecing
marks
and
skipping
town
before
the
chips
could
fall.
Back
then
he
had
a
partner
with
a
like-minded
philosophy:
the
longer
the
con,
the
better.
Good
times.
Then
Twisted
Fate
turned
on
him
faster
than
a
foal
in
a
firepit.
Graves
was
no
stranger
to
the
double
cross,
but
somehow
Fate
managed
to
blindside
him.
Never
again.
He
paid
a
fair
chunk
of
his
life
for
that
oversight.
It
was
a
hard
lesson,
but
then
again
the
most
important
ones
tended
to
be.
Now
all
that
was
left
was
to
even
the
score.
The
clank
of
crashing
steel
broke
his
thoughts.
It
was
a
tone
of
bitter
finality,
the
chime
of
swindled
life.
He
knew
it
well.
He
spun
to
find
a
familiar
set
of
bars
lined
mockingly
between
him
and
the
freedom
he
so
recently
won.
Behind
them,
the
oily
face
of
the
man
who
incarcerated
him,
Dr.
Aregor
Priggs,
sneered
in
victory.
He
raised
his
arm,
happy
to
put
a
slug
between
Priggs’
beady
eyes,
but
his
hand
was
empty.
He
was
trapped,
again,
in
Priggs’
privately
funded
detention
facility.
Well,
this
is
a
setback.
Priggs
grinned
broadly,
gathering
a
froth
of
reeking
spittle
in
the
corners
of
his
mouth.
He
was
a
bulbous,
slimy
man
whose
only
redeeming
quality,
as
far
as
Graves
was
concerned,
was
that
he
had
the
stones
to
look
his
captives
in
the
eye
while
he
kept
them
holed
up
like
dogs.
Graves
had
worked
out
that
Priggs
used
this
little
sanctuary
primarily
as
a
place
to
make
high-profile
competitors
disappear,
but
he
had
earned
a
special
cell
for
taking
two
of
Priggs’
more
fetching
mistresses
for
a
week-long
excursion
on
the
sleaze’s
dime.
By
the
time
Priggs’
retinue
of
head-bobbing
corporate
flunkies
tracked
all
the
funds
Graves
funneled,
he
and
Fate
were
already
in
Demacia
hustling
vacationers
on
Conqueror
Beach.
“I
bet
you
thought
you
saw
the
last
of
me,”
Priggs
wheezed.
He
always
wheezed
when
he
talked.
“The
last
I
cared
to,”
Graves
said.
“You
looked
a
might
improved
with
that
pig
face
of
yours
spread
across
a
wall.”
Every
word
carried
a
consequence,
so
Graves
chose
to
savor
them.
“Aren’t
you
curious
how
I
did
it?”
Priggs
was
pleased
with
himself.
“I
don’t
wonder
why
critters
come
crawling
back,
I
just
stomp
harder
next
time.”
“I
hope
you
still
have
that
spirit
when
I’m
through
with
you,”
Priggs
spat.
Graves
didn’t
flinch.
He
may
as
well
have
been
a
tick
for
how
long
he’d
held
on
in
that
place,
with
few
friends
and
fewer
decencies,
tended
by
whatever
trash
Priggs
found
to
run
the
outfit.
Pain
had
long
ago
become
a
chore
more
than
any
kind
of
punishment.
“I
hope
you
eat
something
lighter
the
next
time
I
make
you
soil
yourself,”
he
returned.
“Why
do
you
want
to
join
the
League,
Graves?”
The
question
was
unusually
direct
for
the
wheezing
oaf,
but
when
the
subject
was
the
most
powerful
organization
in
Valoran,
perhaps
even
his
chaps
got
a
little
chafed.
“Don’t
know
why
you’d
stop
to
wonder,”
he
said.
“You
know
my
history
as
well
as
anyone.”
“Miss
me
that
much?”
The
new
voice,
a
relic
from
the
past,
made
Graves’
blood
boil.
He
grabbed
the
bars,
knuckles
white,
as
Twisted
Fate
strolled
into
view
behind
Priggs.
“Fate!
I
know
you’re
crooked
as
a
quarryman’s
spine,
but
you
got
a
real
set
of
tires
throwing
in
with
this
sack
of
stool
again!”
This
wasn’t
the
reunion
Graves
had
planned
all
these
years.
“Why
you-”
the
fat
man
sputtered.
“Why
do
you
want
to
join
the
League,
Graves?”
Twisted
Fate’s
face
was
calm,
unreadable.
“You
let
me
out
of
this
cage
and
I’ll
show
you-”
Graves
roared.
“Why
do
you
want-”
Fate
started
again.
“I’m
going
to
ruin
your
con,
Fate!
The
world
may
buy
that
you’re
some
kind
of
‘champion,’
but
I’m
gonna
show
them
what
you
really
are.
I
will
take
everything
you
have,
and
when
I’m
done,
you’ll
be
lucky
to
scam
the
heat
off
a
campfire.”
Graves
took
a
deep
breath.
He
didn’t
realize
how
much
Twisted
Fate
had
gotten
to
him.
He
silently
vowed
never
to
give
Fate
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
him
this
angry
again.
“How
does
it
feel,
exposing
your
mind?”
Fate
smirked,
a
simple
gesture
that
was
acid
in
Graves’
veins.
He
swallowed,
determined
not
to
lose
his
cool
again.
“Feels
like
I
just
squatted
with
spurs
on,”
he
muttered.
Fate
chuckled.
“It’s
good
to
see
you
again,
Malcolm.”
With
that,
he
strode
out
of
sight,
Priggs
close
on
his
heels.
Graves
sat
in
his
cell,
smoldering,
until
the
bars
suddenly
opened.
Cautiously,
he
exited
the
cell…
…and
found
himself
standing
in
the
Institute
of
War,
weapon
in
hand.
Always
putting
on
a
show.
Graves
clenched
his
teeth
and
cocked
his
gun.
He
wasn’t
one
for
theatrics,
but
if
it
was
a
show
they
wanted...

If
you've
ever
had
a
nemesis
in
your

that
made
you
want
to
call
him
out
for
a
showdown
like
the
no-good,

that
he
is,
you'll
probably
have
a
bit
in

with
this
next
champion.
Allow
me
to
introduce
Graves,
the
Outlaw.
In
addition
to
being
one
of
those
crack-shot
renegade
types,
Graves
is
possessed
of
a
particular
disinclination
towards
everyone's
favorite
Southern
gentleman,
Twisted
Fate
.
Whatever
the
result
of
his
arrival
in
the
League,
one
thing’s
for

Somebody's
going

with

Announcement
made
by
Average
Gatsby
:
Greetings
Summoners!
We
wanted
to
take
this
opportunity
to
preview
some
of
the
gameplay
on
our
newest
ranged
DPS
champion:
Graves,
the
Outlaw.
This
rough-and-tumble
gunman
uses
a
massive,
hextech
double-barreled
shotgun
to
rain
down
death
from
a
distance
and
punish
any
foolish
varmints
that
get
too
close.
For
example,
Buckshot
shoots
three
quick
shrapnel
bursts
in
a
cone
in
front
of
him.
Unlike
other
multi-missile
spells,
however,
all
three
Buckshot
rounds
can
all
hit
the
same
target
(although
each
individual
projectile
will
deal
slightly
reduced
damage).
Graves
is
also
able
to
make
it
uncomfortable
for
foes
to
fight
at
his
optimal
range
by
throwing
out
Smoke
Screen
to
limit
enemy
vision
and
slow
them
in
an
area,
while
Quick
Draw
lets
him
dash
in
for
a
quick
shotgun
blast
or
escape
danger
as
needed.
In
this
way
he
can
control
his
positioning
to
set
up
maximum
damage
Buckshots.
Finally,
Graves
can
use
Collateral
Damage
to
unleash
a
skill
shot
that
nukes
the
first
target
it
hits,
spreading
a
cone
of
damage
behind
its
target
to
hit
anybody
yellow
enough
to
hide
behind
the
tanks.
While
the
single-target
use
is
simple,
properly
utilizing
the
cone
is
what
will
separate
the
good
Graves
players
from
the
great
ones.
Our
goal
with
Graves
was
to
make
a
ranged
DPS
that
had
some
incentive
to
get
up
close
or
make
enemies
think
twice
before
getting
in
your
face.
While
it's
completely
possible
to
play
Graves
as
a
standard
max-range
carry,
this
dichotomy
makes
for
skill
differential
without
adding
a
high
barrier
to
entry
(or
any
hefty,
paragraph-long
tooltips).
Whether
trying
to
maximize
the
close-up
damage
of
Buckshot,
or
setting
up
the
1-2
punch
of
Collateral
Damage,
we’re
excited
to
add
a
champion
with
true
grit
to
the
ranged
DPS
lineup.
