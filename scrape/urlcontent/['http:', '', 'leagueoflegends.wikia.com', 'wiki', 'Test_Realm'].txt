The
Test
Realm
is
a
side
client
that
exists
for
the
purpose
of
gathering
bugs
and
feedback.
It
is
used
as
a
tool
for
the
benefit
of
the
development
team.
The
Test
Realm
is
the
first
place
new
champions
,
items
,
maps
,
and
other
changes
to
the
game
before
launch.
The
Test
Realm
is
a
private
client
used
for
the
benefit
of
the
Riot
development
team.
There
are
very
few
players
from
the
League
of
Legends
community
that
have
access
to
the
test
realm.
Occasionally
Riot
will
host
giveaways
or
send
out
invitations
to
members
of
the
community,
although
this
is
a
rare
occurrence.
General
Rules
If
you
are
being
unhelpful,
spamming,
consistently
leaving
matchmade
games,
or
just
being
disruptive
in
general,
you
will
be
banned
without
warning.
Test
Realm
access
is
a
privilege,
not
a
right
and
can
be
revoked
at
any
time
for
any
reason.
Please
keep
topics
organized
[in
the
forums]
and
do
not
open
new
topics
when
there
is
already
an
existing
active
thread.

Confidentiality
Quoting
of
Pendragon
[2]
:
"[...]
That
being
said
-
we're
seeing
more
and
more
instances
of
test-realm
content
being
posted
to
the
general
section
of
this
site,
and
to
other
sites.
I
want
to
reinforce
that
test-realm
content
is
considered
to
be
confidential
outside
of
this
forum
section,
that
means:
You
should
not
be
taking
or
releasing
screenshots
of
unreleased
content
You
should
not
be
releasing
guides
(including
videos)
for
unreleased
characters
You
should
not
be
discussing
ANYTHING
on
the
test
realm
in-game,
on
other
sites,
or
outside
of
this
forum
section"
"Whether
[the
content]
it's
available
or
not
-
we
require
at
the
moment
that
[the
Test
Realm
Forum
is]
the
only
source
for
it"
With
this
being
said,
new
content
news
is
not
released
to
the
public
unless
specifically
approved
by
Riot
Staff.
