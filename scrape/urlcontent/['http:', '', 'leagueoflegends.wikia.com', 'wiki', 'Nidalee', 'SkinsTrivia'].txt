Trivia
Nidalee
was
designed
by
Brackhar
.
[1]
[2]
Nidalee
is
voiced
by
Kelly
Fosdahl
Burge
[3]
[4]
[5]
[6]
Nidalee's
design
may
have
been
inspired
by
Navee,
the
protagonist
of
the
french
graphic
novel
Wake
.
Nidalee
is
one
of
five
champions
to
have
more
than
4
skills,
the
other
being
Karma
,
Jayce
,
Elise
and
Lee
Sin
.
Nidalee
was
the
first
champion
to
have
more
than
4
skills.
Nidalee,
along
with
Elise
,
Jayce
,
Kayle
and
Quinn
are
the
only
champions
to
be
both
ranged
and
melee.
Nidalee
is
one
of
a
few
champions
to
have
multiple
textures
in
one
skin.
One
for
her
human
form,
and
another
for
her
cougar
form
to
match.
Nidalee
is
the
first
champion
to
feature
a
transformation
ability.
The
others
being
Swain
,
Shyvana
and
Elise
.
Nidalee
has
4
running
animations:
her
default
human
form
run,
her
default
cougar
form
run,
her
human
form-bush
sprint,
and
lastly
her
cougar
form-bush
sprint.
Before
her
release
Nidalee
was
rumored
to
have
a
special
stackable
DOT
that
could
be
applied
by
all
her
damaging
abilities
and
her
passive
provided
2
seconds
of
stealth
when
leaving
brush
in
cougar
form.
It
was
removed
prior
to
her
release.
Nidalee
used
to
be
the
only
champion
to
have
any
ability
put
on
a
static
cooldown
.
Specifically,
the
capped
spell
is
her
cougar
form's
Pounce
.
This
was
removed
in
patch
V1.0.0.124
.
Her
hidden
passive
gives
a
nearby
allied
champion
which
is
lower
level
than
her
5
exp
per
5
sec.
Nidalee
had
a
bug
where
she
could
kill
teammates
with
her
Primal
Surge
by
applying
the
damage
of
her
Swipe
as
well.
Since
the
potential
damage
of
Swipe
is
higher
than
the
healing
of
Primal
Surge
its
damage
could
kill
off
a
low
health
ally.
A
maximum-range
Javelin
Toss
has
the
second-highest
damage
of
any
non-ultimate
single-target
ability
in
the
game
(only
surpassed
by
a
full
channeled
Drain
by
Fiddlesticks
)
and
higher
damage
than
many
ultimate
abilities.
Quotes
Nidalee
is
one
of
the
few
champions
to
have
an
extra
set
of
/command
animations.
When
in
cougar
form,
she
changes
her
/taunt,
/laugh,
and
/dance
animations
(though
there
is
no
voice
change).
Skins
All
of
Nidalee's
skins
change
the
appearance
of
her
cougar
form.
Snow
Bunny
Nidalee
was
only
available
during
the
Snowdown
Showdown
of
2009.
Pharaoh
Nidalee
is
a
reference
to
Cleopatra
.
Bewitching
Nidalee
was
only
available
during
The
Harrowing
of
2011.
Headhunter
Nidalee
is
a
reference
to
Machiko
Noguchi
of
the
Predator
franchise.
[1]
She
shares
this
skin
with
Headhunter
Yi
and
Headhunter
Rengar
.
Relations
Nidalee
has
been
dating
the
summoner
and
journalist,
Bob
Nashahago
.
However,
through
Blitzcrank's
fleshling
dating
service,
Nashahago
was
matched
with
Janna
.
Whether
or
not
this
is
a
matter
of
infidelity
on
his
part
is
unclear,
though
Nidalee
is
seen
in
her
cougar
form
facing
down
both
Nashahago
and
Janna
in
a
picture
presented
in
Blitzcrank's
"Successful
Matches"
.
For
unknown
reasons,
Nidalee
is
friends
with
Udyr
and
a
rival
of
Rengar
according
to
the
new
beta
website
for
League
of
Legends.
[7]
Possibly
due
to
Udyr
being
tied
to
nature
and
animals
and
Rengar
being
a
hunter.
