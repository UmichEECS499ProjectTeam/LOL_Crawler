multiple
Biscuits,
you
will
only
get
the
20HP/10MP
effect
when
the
last
tick
of
the
previous
one
ends.

Trivia
This
item
is
named
after
John
Bain
aka
TotalBiscuit,
The
Cynical
Brit
a
famous
YouTuber
and
game
commentator,
for
achieving
a
high
number
of
LoL
referrals
.
His
original
intent,
as
stated
in
one
of
his
videos,
was
for
the
item
that
was
to
be
named
after
him
be
a
top
hat.
Having
the
related
mastery
point
for
the
item
gives
the
related
additional
item
Poro-Snax
in
the
Howling
Abyss
map
that
can
be
used,
as
the
name
suggests,
to
feed
Poros
.
