Strategy
This

helps
Attack
Damage
based
champions
against
teams
with
strong
magic
damage
.
The
shield
can
block
the
initial
burst
of
damage
from
a
enemy
champion
and
give
the
owner
an
opportunity
to
attack
or
retreat.
It
is
very
useful
against
AP
casters
with
long
cooldowns,
such
as
Morgana
and
Ziggs
.
More
magic
resistance
will
increase
the
effective
shield
value,
as
more
magic
damage
will
be
required
to
destroy
the
shield.
Attack
Damage
champions
who
benefit
from
being
at
low
health
(e.g.
Tryndamere
,
Olaf
,
Aatrox
)
can
put
it
to
great
use.
Their
low-health
passives
combined
with
the
item's
AD
effect,
and
the
shield
allows
them
to
stay
at
lower
health
more
safely.
Trivia
At
30%
of
total
health,
when
this
item's
shield
activates,
it
provides
the
maximum
35

Maw
of
Malmortius
is

and
