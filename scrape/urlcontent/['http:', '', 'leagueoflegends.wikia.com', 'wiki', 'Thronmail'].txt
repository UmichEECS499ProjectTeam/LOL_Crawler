Efficiency
Thornmail
is

9
%
gold
efficient.
For
the
item
to
be
gold
efficient,
its
passive
must
have
a
value
of
at
least
200
gold.
Strategy
Tanks
benefit
most
from
Thornmail
,
particularly
when
the
opposing
team
has
high
basic
attack
damage
output.
League
of
Legends
calculates
Thornmail's
reflected
damage
before
armor
reduces
the
damage.
This
means
you
can
reflect
more
damage
than
you
ultimately
take
[2]
if
you
have
at
least
234
effective
armor
(i.e.
after
reductions
and
penetration).
[3]
Thornmail
is
best
used
to
counter
champions
that
mainly
rely
on
basic
attacks
such
as
Tryndamere
and
Ashe
.
Thornmail
is
often
overshadowed
by
the
other
two
high
armor
items,
Frozen
Heart
and
Randuin's
Omen
,
because
it
benefits
only
the
wearer
instead
of
the
entire
team
and
only
provides
armor
.
Because
of
these
reasons,
it
is
generally
acquired
only
as
a
counter
against
certain
champions
or
against
an
AD
heavy
team.
Champions
such
as
Rammus
,
Galio
and
Shen
can
make
great
use
of
the
passive
effect
due
to
their
ability
to
taunt
enemies,
forcing
enemies
to
attack
them
with
basic
attacks.
Notes
Thornmail
deals
magic
damage
,
and
so
the
target's
magic
resistance
will
reduce
the
damage
returned.
Life
steal
is
another
option
to
reduce
its
overall
effect.
There
is
a
misconception
that
lifesteal
counters
the
reflected
damage
from
Thornmail
.
As
the
reflected
damage
is
calculated
before
reduction
(from
either
armor
or
damage
reduction)
while
lifesteal
is
calculated
after
reduction.
Thornmail
reflects
both
physical
and
magic
damage;
the
only
determining
factor
in
its
trigger
is
whether
the
attack
is
defined
as
proccing
on-hit
effects
.
For
example,
Warwick's
Infinite
Duress
deals
only
magic
damage,
but
still
procs
Thornmail's
unique
passive.
The
damage
reflection
works
with
basic
attacks
and
next-hit
effect
abilities.
On-hit
effects
from
abilities
(
Impure
Shots
,
Bio-Arcane
Barrage
,
Blighted
Quiver
)
or
items
(
Nashor's
Tooth
,
Wit's
End
,
Blade
of
the
Ruined
King
)
can
bypass
Thornmail's
passives
and
not
harm
the
attacker.
Blind
counts
as
a
form
of
damage
mitigation
and
is
thus
applied
after
Thornmail
,
i.e.
damage
is
still
reflected
even
though
none
is
actually
done.
Damage
returned
from
Thornmail
will
break
passives
which
are
removed
by
champion
damage
such
as
Move
Quick
or
Strut
.
It
will
also
drag
tower
aggro.
Fiora
's
ultimate
does
on-hit
damage
based
on
her
maximum
damage
and
calculated
armor
pen.
If
Thornmail
is
built
quickly
against
a
snowballing
Fiora
,
she
can
seriously
hurt
herself
or
even
suicide
against
a
champion
utilizing
it,
assuming
she
doesn't
have
much
lifesteal.
A
Poppy
that
has
shielded
herself
using
Diplomatic
Immunity
will
still
reflect
the
full
amount
of
Thornmail
damage
to
the
non-targeted
enemies,
despite
taking
no
damage
herself.
The
Thornmail's
damage
will
be
amplified
against
her
targeted
enemy,
as
all
of
her
damage
is.
The
amount
reflected
will
be
36
/
39
/
42%
total.
