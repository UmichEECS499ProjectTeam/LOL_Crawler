The
city
of
Zaun
is
a
place
where
both
magic
and
science
have
gone
awry.
The
unchecked
nature
of
experimentation
has
taken
its
toll
on
the
city.
However,
Zaun's
lenient
restrictions
allow
their
researchers
and
inventors
the
leeway
to
push
the
bounds
of
science
at
an
accelerated
rate,
for
better
or
worse.
It
was
under
these
conditions
that
a
team
of
doctoral
students
from
Zaun's
College
of
Techmaturgy
made
a
breakthrough
in
the
field
of
intelligent
steam
automation.
Their
creation,
the
steam
golem
Blitzcrank,
was
developed
to
exercise
judgement
on-the-fly
in
order
to
assist
with
Zaun's
hazardous
waste
reclamation
process,
since
so
often
the
conditions
did
not
allow
for
human
supervision.
However,
he
soon
began
exhibiting
unforeseen
behaviors.
Over
time,
the
scientists
were
able
to
identify
a
demonstrated
learning
process,
and
Blitzcrank
fast
became
a
celebrity.
As
is
sadly
often
the
case
though,
credit
for
the
golem's
creation
was
scooped
up
by
another
-
Professor
Stanwick
Pididly
-
though
most
now
know
the
truth.
In
the
wake
of
the
ensuing
legal
maelstrom,
it
became
evident
that
neither
party
truly
had
the
steam
golem's
best
interests
at
heart,
and
Blitzcrank
humbly
petitioned
for
personal
autonomy.
Backed
by
overwhelming
support
from
the
public,
it
took
the
liberal
Council
of
Zaun
only
a
few
weeks
to
declare
Blitzcrank
a
fully-independent,
sentient
entity.
A
unique
being,
the
golem
left
Zaun,
distressed
by
the
controversy
and
feeling
there
was
no
place
he
could
fit
in.
His
travels
led
him
to
the
one
location
in
Valoran
where
unique
beings
have
a
place
-
the
League
of
Legends
.
Fortunately,
he
was
easily
able
to
adapt
his
design
to
suit
the
rigors
he
would
face
on
the
Fields
of
Justice
.
"Though
Blitzcrank
may
batter
anything
that
stands
in
his
way,
he
really
has
a
heart
of
gold...encased
in
a
framework
of
iron...in
a
carapace
of
steel."
