Champion
For
his
incomparable
skill
with
the
bow
and
his
unquestioned
sense
of
honor,
Varus
was
chosen
to
be
the
warden
of
a
sacred
Ionian
temple.
The
temple
was
built
to
contain
an
ancient
pit
of
corruption
so
vile
that
Ionian
Elders
feared
it
could
envelop
the
island
in
darkness.
Varus
prided
himself
on
his
position,
as
only
the
most
exceptional
Ionian
warriors
were
selected
for
the
role.
He
lived
with
his
family
in
a
nearby
village
and
led
a
quiet
life
of
disciplined
routine
until
the
day
the
forces
of
Noxus
invaded
Ionia.
Their
shock
troops
left
nothing
but
death
and
desolation
in
their
wake,
and
the
temple
lay
in
their
path.
Varus
was
forced
to
make
a
decision.
He
was
bound
by
honor
to
stay
and
defend
the
temple,
but
without
him
the
village's
few
inhabitants
could
offer
little
resistance
against
the
oncoming
war
machine.
Gravely,
he
chose
to
fulfill
his
duty
as
a
warden.
The
corruption
could
not
be
allowed
to
escape.
His
arrows
sundered
the
troops
who
tried
to
wrest
the
temple
from
him
that
day.
However,
when
he
returned
to
his
village,
he
found
that
it
had
been
reduced
to
a
smoldering
graveyard.
Remorse
at
the
sight
of
his
slain
family
gave
way
to
overwhelming
regret
and
then
to
seething
hatred.
He
swore
to
slaughter
every
Noxian
invader,
but
first
he
needed
to
become
stronger.
He
turned
to
that
which
he
had
sacrificed
everything
to
protect.
The
pit
of
corruption
would
consume
him
wholly,
as
a
flame
devours
a
wick,
but
its
abominable
power
would
burn
within
him
until
he
was
lost.
This
was
a
path
from
which
there
could
be
no
return.
With
grim
resolve,
he
condemned
himself
to
the
black
flames,
feeling
malevolent
energy
bond
to
his
skin...
and
with
it,
the
promise
of
ruin.
He
left,
seeking
the
blood
of
all
Noxians
involved
with
the
invasion,
a
grisly
task
that
eventually
led
him
to
the
invasion's
most
infamous
perpetrators
in
the
League
of
Legends
.
"The
life
of
an
arrow
is
fleeting,
built
of
nothing
but
direction
and
intent."

CLE
OBSERVATION
He
absorbs
his
bow,
lest
he
be
tempted
to
use
it
in
the
Institute
of
War;
it
slithers
into
his
palm
to
rest.
The
polish
of
the
chamber
is
immaculate,
so
that
in
its
ornamental
shields
and
blades
his
form
can
be
seen
reflected;
"his"
form,
though
he
can
never
recognize
it
as
his
own.
His
arms
disappear
into
black
gauntlets
of
a
liquid
that
can't
entirely
decide
on
a
shape;
brackish
muck
creeps
from
his
toes
nearly
to
his
navel,
scabbing
over
into
plates.
What
might
seem
purely
black
is,
upon
closer
inspection,
almost
infinitely
complex
in
color;
it
travels
his
surface
like
an
oil.
Varus
wonders
if
it
might
have
claimed
more
since
yesterday,
lapping
as
it
does
at
what
pure
flesh
remains.
He
decides
that
he
is,
on
the
whole,
satisfied
with
their
arrangement
-
even
if
mirrors
show
him
a
creature
like
this.
I
am
not
broken,
he
tells
himself.
Not
broken.
Simply
have
a
different
shape.
REFLECTION
Teaching
is
learning.
Showing
Theshan
where
to
hold
the
bow,
how
to
draw,
and
how
to
remember
his
breath
gave
Varus
a
better
understanding
of
these
things
himself.
His
son
would
need
to
know
these
things
for
himself;
his
father
had
been
anointed
Temple
Guardian,
after
all.
He
wouldn't
always
be
there.
Varus
wasn't
there
now,
strictly
speaking;
none
of
this
was
real,
and
his
clever
eyes
knew
it.
This
was
some
game
Summoners
played
to
amuse
themselves
with
aspirants
to
the
League.
But
here
was
his
son,
blessedly
alive.
He
tousled
the
boy's
warm
hair.
Varus
knew
what
was
coming,
and
he
took
such
blessings
where
he
could.
The
two
of
them
looked
up
the
hill,
up,
until
they
saw
the
Temple
itself.
It
was
older
than
the
village,
much
older.
A
statement
from
a
bygone
era
of
plenty,
there
was
no
pragmatism
in
its
construction.
"A
Pit
of
Pallas,"
said
the
son
who
was
not
his
son.
"There
is
a
Pit
of
Pallas
there."
"I
did
not
know
it
at
the
time,
but
yes,"
replied
Varus.
"They
left
a
single
man
in
its
defense?"
"They
did."
Much
surprised
him
about
his
new
role.
The
old
prayers
he'd
said
every
day
since
he
was
a
boy,
it
seemed,
were
missing
a
few
grave
syllables;
the
Elders
had
been
holding
out.
Tattoos
of
the
clever
Owl,
applied
to
the
face,
chest,
and
arms
had
altered
his
perception;
this
too
was
surprising.
Then,
there
was
The
Pit,
and
just
five
feet
across,
it
was
hard
to
imagine
this
featureless
disc
could
be
the
source
of
so
much
concern.
He
was
most
surprised,
perhaps,
when
-
on
his
first
night's
vigil
-
it
began
to
speak.
Not
with
words,
no
-
words
would
have
been
much
easier
to
deflect.
It
spoke
in
moments,
mostly:
images,
sensations.
It
knew
people,
it
could
taste
them
on
the
air.
It
knew
that
they
had
a
hive
at
the
base
of
its
hill,
where
they
writhed
in
their
nonsense
bodies.
Varus
could
sense
its
confusion,
and
something
like
being
hurt;
the
isolation
of
the
temple
had
accrued
in
it.
It
wanted
to
show
him
something
he
would
like.
It
wanted
to
make
something
for
him.
Its
urge
was
to
please.
This
was
not
the
"implacable
beast"
he
had
been
sworn
to
contain.
Once,
as
Varus
entered
the
sanctum
to
perform
the
morning's
Rite
of
Sealing,
he
was
made
to
see
himself,
surrounded
by
others
of
his
village,
standing
with
a
young
man's
vigor
while
those
around
him
withered
like
crops,
their
skins
falling
off
like
sacks.
He
could
sense
that
it
seemed
somehow
pleased
with
itself.
"Now?"
it
offered,
confident
in
the
reply.
"No,"
replied
Varus.
When
it
spoke
next,
he
ceased
to
exist
in
the
present
altogether.
Instead
he
waded
through
ankle-high
blood,
the
ripples
he
made
growing
and
rising
until
they
roared
and
crashed.
He
heard
a
voice,
then,
or
the
idea
of
a
voice,
which
said,
pleadingly,
"Now?"
The
bite
of
the
incense,
with
its
teeth
of
rosemary
and
oak,
cut
through
the
vision.
He
fell
back
on
the
palms
of
his
hands,
turning
and
scrambling
to
load
the
brazier.
It
tipped
on
its
copper
chain,
spilling
and
searing
his
hands.
"NOW?"
It
crashed
against
his
mind,
but
the
Owl
asserted
itself.
It
gave
him
will
enough
to
pull
himself
along
the
maze-like
walls
to
the
doorway,
where
he
could
see
the
village
burning;
again,
he
had
to
see
it
all
again.
He
ran,
though
he
didn't
entirely
know
why;
there
was
a
part
of
him
that
though
if
he
took
this
path,
slid
down
this
face
instead
of
that,
maybe
it
would
be
different.
Perhaps
he
would
not
find
his
broken
wife
alongside
his
broken
boy
alongside
his
broken
bow;
perhaps
he
would
not
pick
up
that
bow
and
bring
it
back
to
the
Temple.
He
was
wrong.
He
was
given
a
vision
then
of
a
thousand,
thousand
dead.
It
was
a
wedge
pounded
through
his
ribs
and
into
his
heart.
He
fell
to
his
knees.
"Now?"
It
was
almost
a
whisper.
"Now,"
Varus
whispered
back.
"Now,
damn
you."
And
when
he
did
so
it
broke
a
dam
deep
in
the
earth,
so
that
the
placid
disc
of
the
pool
reached
up
from
its
heart
and
splashed
out,
leaving
jags
of
hot
black
glass
standing
wherever
it
touched.
It
was
flowing
through
the
air,
around
the
curling
smoke
until
it
struck
Varus
off
his
feet.
It
peeled
his
hand,
digesting
it,
consuming
the
bow.
It
ate
both
arms,
and
both
legs,
stopping
out
of...
respect,
if
respect
it
may
be
called,
for
the
Owl;
it
would
not
surpass
the
markings.
In
a
moment
of
detached
madness,
Varus
wondered
how
long
that
would
last.
The
Reflection
wavered,
and
a
summoner
panted
with
exertion;
the
images
wrested
themselves
from
their
bindings,
careening
through
a
nightmarish
series
of
scenes
with
an
animal
immediacy.
The
room
solidified,
rendered
overbright
by
the
alien
senses
which
collected
the
last
few
years
of
Varus'
grim
past:
Only
the
tips
of
each
of
his
toes
touched
the
ground;
Varus
knew
the
force
couldn't
be
far.
When
he
overtook
them,
the
cart
at
the
head
of
the
column
had
the
wisdom
to
encourage
its
horses.
Those
without
wisdom,
or
those
cursed
by
circumstance,
began
to
die
with
terrible
speed.
As
Varus
slowed,
an
apparatus
with
a
bow's
purpose,
if
not
its
shape,
leapt
to
life
for
the
first
time
at
his
wrist.
He
needed
not
be
instructed
in
its
use;
a
man
was
instantly
pierced,
burst
like
a
wineskin.
This
proved
a
true
inspiration
to
his
fellows,
who
found
within
themselves
a
speed
they
never
knew
possible;
though
even
at
this
speed,
they
were
still
beings
of
flesh
and
blood.
Insufficient.
Though
what
it
fired
wasn't
an
arrow,
it
behaved
as
one;
it
ruined
as
one,
traveled
through
the
Noxian
insignia,
out
of
one
gasping
soldier
and
into
another,
exploding
with
six
thirsting
tongues
that
gripped
and
snared.
With
every
death
Varus
shot
faster,
until
by
the
end
there
was
no
sense
that
each
shot
was
discrete.
The
Prey
simply
ran
until
it
fell.
It
was
elegant
horror.
Time
passes
quickly.
There
were
more
hunts,
and
more
blood;
mercies
were
promised,
but
withheld.
Darkness
swirled
with
the
scent
of
wet
leaves,
oddly
sweet,
the
broken
bodies
of
men
and
women
rendered
wholly
abstract
in
the
course
of
their
annihilation.
Varus
knelt
over
a
sundered
cart
to
seize
a
communique,
pierced
through
by
one
of
his
sharp
tendrils;
it
revealed
the
names
of
yet
a
few
more
Noxian
dogs,
responsible
for
issuing
the
order...
The
damning
order.
What
they
took
from
him
he
would
repay
a
thousand-fold.
A
summoner
stepped
forward,
her
mask
of
judgment
impassive,
her
presence
sweeping
away
the
last
threads
of
the
vision.
"Your
purpose
here
is
clear.
You
have
discerned
that
among
our
Champions
there
exist
Noxian
agents.
This,
all
of
this,"
she
waved
her
hand,
"is
the
prosecution
of
some
vendetta."
"You
understand,
of
course,
that
your
vengeance
is
not
the
purpose
of
the
League?"
she
said,
eyes
narrowed.
"By
now,
you
surely
realized,"
said
Varus,
or
the
amalgam
which
stood
before
them
cloaked
in
Varus,
its
tongue
swollen
and
black.
"It
is
the
only
purpose
I
have
left."

Varus,
the
Arrow
of
Retribution
Revealed!
Announcement
made

:
[2]
Summoners!
If
you've
been
wondering
what
can
happen
when
someone
really,
truly
lets
their
dark
side
get
the
best
of
them,
then
look
no
further
than
Varus,
the
Arrow
of
Retribution.
This
dangerous
combination
between
caster
and
ranged
carry
is
equipped
with
a
number
of
abilities
designed
to
both
whittle
enemies
down
from
range,
and
allow
him
to
close
in
for
the
kill.
The
lynchpin
in
Varus'
kit
is
Piercing
Arrow
–
a
long
ranged
skill
shot
attack
that
damages
enemies
in
a
line.
Pressing
Q
will
cause
Varus
to
draw
back
his
bow,
reducing
his
movement
speed,
but
steadily
ramping
up
damage
and
range
(up
to
a
cap)
until
you
left
click
to
select
a
target.
Through
creative
positioning
Varus
can
either
use
this
skill
to
pepper
enemies
with
long
range
attacks
or
close
out
a
kill
on
a
fleeing
enemy
with
a
hard-hitting
shot.
In
lane,
Varus'
unique
combination
of
abilities
gives
him
the
ability
to
apply
constant
pressure
to
his
opponent.
Piercing
Arrow
allows
him
to
both
farm
safely
and
damage
enemy
champions
without
fear
of
reprisal.
Meanwhile,
the
area
of
effect
healing
debuff
from
Hail
of
Arrows
complicates
a
support
champion's
efforts
to
out-heal
the
attrition
damage.
When
the
time
comes
to
move
in
for
the
kill,
Living
Vengeance
keeps
Varus'
attack
speed
high
while
he’s
last
hitting,
enabling
him
to
quickly
stack
up
Contamination
charges
from
Blighted
Quiver
in
preparation
for
a
finishing
blow.
In
team
fights,
Varus'
long
range
allows
him
to
maintain
safe
positioning
until
he's
able
to
score
a
kill
on
an
enemy
champion.
Once
he's
picked
off
an
enemy,
the
massive
attack
speed
boost
from
Living
Vengeance
combined
with
area
of
effect
crowd
control
from
Chains
of
Corruption
make
him
a
truly
terrifying
sight
on
the
battlefield.

Vengeance
(Innate)
On
kill
or
assist,
Varus
temporarily
gains
attack
speed.
This
bonus
is
larger
if
the
enemy
is
a
champion.
Piercing
Arrow
(Q)
Varus
readies
and
then
fires
a
powerful
shot
that
gains
extra

and

the
longer
he
spends
preparing
to
fire.
Blighted
Quiver
(W)
Varus'
basic
attacks
deal
bonus
magic

apply

a
hail
of
arrows

ground
slows

and
reduces
their
healing
and
regeneration.

Varus
flings
out
a
tendril
of
corruption
that
immobilizes
the

spreads
towards
nearby
uninfected
champions,
immobilizing
them
too
on
contact.
