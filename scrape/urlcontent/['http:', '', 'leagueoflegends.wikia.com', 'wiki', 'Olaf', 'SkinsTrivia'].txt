Trivia
Olaf
was
designed
by
Coronach
.
His
name
is
common
to
those
of
the
Vikings
(of
Scandinavian
origin),
his
title
in
particular
to
the
berserkers,
Norse
warriors
who
are
recorded
in
Old
Norse
literature
to
have
fought
in
a
nearly
uncontrollable,
trance-like
fury,
a
characteristic
which
later
gave
rise
to
the
English
word
"berserk".
Most
berserkers
wore
little
to
no
protection,
save
a
bear
skin
called
a
"Bear-sark",
which
is
where
the
word
originated
from.
The
berserkers
believed
that
by
wearing
the
bear's
skin,
they
were
able
call
upon
the
bear's
ferocious
rage
and
strength
in
battle.
Note
that
real
Vikings
did
not
have
horns
in
their
helms,
that
is
just
a
modern
depiction.
In
the
movie
Clerks
,
the
character
Silent
Bob
has
a
cousin
in
a
heavy
metal
band
that
goes
by
the
stage
name
"Olaf
the
Berserker".
Olaf
/dance
is
a
direct
reference
to
the
German
Technoviking
.
Ragnarok
is
a
reference
to
a
string
of
events
in
Norse
Mythology
that
heralds
the
end
the
gods
of
era.
This
was
also
the
beginning
of
the
Man's
era.
The
Chinese
&
Japanese
character
displayed
on
the
icon
is
力
(li
-
chikara),
which
means
"power"
in
Chinese
and
Japanese
respectively.
Ragnarok
crowd-control
removement
effects
is
a
reference
to
Poetic
Edda
strings:
"
For
the
forth
I
know,
if
men
place
bonds
on
my
limbs,
I
so
sing
that
I
can
walk;
the
fetter
starts
from
my
feet,
and
the
manacle
from
my
hands.
"
That
looks
like
it
shouldn't
remove
silence
and
blindness
effects,
like
it
used
to
be
with
old
Olaf's
ultimate.
Quotes
Olaf's
quote
"
Urge
to
kill,
rising!
"
is
a
reference
to
one
of
Homer
Simpson's
famous
lines,
from
the
Treehouse
of
Horror
V
episode.
Brolaf's
quote,
"Bromacia!"
is
a
reference
to
Demacians
and
their
tendency
to
shout
"Demacia."
Brolaf's
taunt
"I
came
here
to
kick
butt
and
drink
Graggy!
Looks
like
I'm
all
out
of
Graggy"
is
a
reference
to
a
quote
in
the
1988
film
They
Live
-
"I
have
come
here
to
chew
bubblegum
and
kick
ass...and
I'm
all
out
of
bubblegum."
Brolaf's
other
taunt
"
You
can't
arrest
me,
my
dad
owns
a
dealership!
"
is
a
reference
to
Aqua
Teen
Hunger
Force
,
in
which
two
alien
bros
crash
land
on
earth,
and
one
is
constantly
telling
others
about
how
his
dad
owns
this
dealership.
Brolaf's
quote
"
Hey
dude,
I'm
kind
of
a
big
deal
"
may
be
a
reference
to
Ron
Burgundy's
quote
in
the
movie
Anchorman
.
Brolaf's
quote
"Beatdown
City,
population
-
you"
is
a
reference
to
Deadpool's
popular
quote

loser
land,
population,
YOU!"
Skins
Glacial
Olaf
is
a
reference
to
the
various
ice
giants
in
Norse
Mythology.
In
Chinese
splash
art
for
Olaf's
skins,
one
of
his
axes
is
always
surrounded
by
lightning.
This
is
a
direct
reference
to
Thor,
the
norse
god
of
thunder
and
his
hammer,
Mjolnir.
The
Brolaf
skin
is
voiced
by
Riot
Lomar.
Brolaf's
skin
art
is
based
off
of
the
internet
image
meme
"
Beerbarian
."
The
name
"Sivir"
is
written
ornately
on
the
back
of
Olaf's
jeans,
hinting
at
a
clothing
line
by
the
Battle
Mistress
.
An
icon
of
Teemo's
head
can
be
seen
on
Olaf's
shirt.
Brolaf's
drink
of
choice,
Graggy
Ice
is
a
reference
to
real-life
beer
Natural
Ice
(more
commonly
called
natty
ice,
or
just
natty)
It
is
cheap
and
commonly
drunk
by

poor
college
students.
It
is
also
inferred
that
Graggy
Ice
is
made
by
Gragas
.
Olaf
shares
a
Pentakill
theme
with
Mordekaiser
,
Sona
,
Yorick
and
Karthus
.
He
is
the
fifth
champion
with
a
Pentakill
skin.
Penttakill
Olaf's
drumsticks
have
a
similar
design
to
the
Mask
of
Terror
of
Splatterhouse.
Pentakill
Olaf's
appearance
is
based
on
famous
thrash
metal
drummer
Vinnie
Paul
Abbott
,
including
his
iconic
beard
and
cowboy
hat.
Apparently
Pentakill
Olaf
as
Pentakill's
drummer
was
proposed
by
the
community
