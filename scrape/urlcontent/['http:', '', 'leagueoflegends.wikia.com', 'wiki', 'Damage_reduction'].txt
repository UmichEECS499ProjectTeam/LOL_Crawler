reduction
Damage
modifiers
refer
to
the
buffs
or
debuffs
to
a
unit
that
causes
it
to
deal
or
receive
increased
or
decreased
damage.
These
are
percentage
values.
They
don't
add
extra
flat
damage
but
modify
all
damage
normally
done.
These
buffs
or
debuffs
are
only
received
by
champion
abilities
,
neutral
buffs
,
on-hit
effects
from
items
and
masteries
.

Damage
dealt
modifier
These
are
buffs
that
allow
the
champion
that
has
them
to
deal
increased
or
decreased
magic
or
physical
damage
from
autoattacks
,
abilities
,
item's
actives
and
Ignite
.
The
raw
value
from
the
attack
or
ability
is
increased
or
decreased
by
the
modifier
and
then
applied
to
the
target.
All
damage
dealt
modifiers
stack
multiplicatively
.
Since
multiplication
is
commutative
,
the
order
is
irrelevant.
So
if
Talon
uses
an
autoattack
on
a
CC'd
champion
just
after
using
a
maxed
Cutthroat
on
it,
while
affected
by
Urgot's
Zaun-Touched
Bolt
Augmenter
,
his
autoattack's
damage
will
be
modified
by
107.525%
(110%
×
115%
×
85%).

Damage
immunity
There
are
some
instances
in
the
game
where
a
champion
is
immune
to
receiving
any
kind
of
damage
(including
true
damage)
for
a
few
seconds.

Kayle's
Intervention
grants
the
target
ally
champion
damage
immunity
for
2
/
2.
5
/
3
seconds.
Poppy's

Immunity
grants
her
complete
immunity
from
all
sources
except

for
6
/

/

seconds.
Items
Zhonya's
Hourglass
grants

user
damage
immunity
for
2
seconds.
Flat
Damage
Reduction
Several
champions
have
abilities
that
reduce
damage
by
a
flat
amount.
Flat
damage
reduction
is
factored
in
after
armor
or
magic
resistance
(verify?
Sion's
page
disagrees)
.
This
makes
it
significantly
better
the
more
resistances
you
have.
In
addition,
periodic
damage
effects
will
have
each
tick
of
damage
reduced.
For
example,
Malzahar's
Malefic
Visions
ticks
8
times,
so
1
flat
damage
reduction
would
reduce
its
total
damage
by
8.
Flat
damage
reduction
does
not
work
against
true
damage.

Pain
provides
a
40%
chance
to
ignore
30
/

/

flat
damage
against
auto-attacks.
Items

basic
attacks.
Masteries
Block
reduces

taken

champions'
basic
attacks
by

taken
from
monsters
by
1
/
2.
