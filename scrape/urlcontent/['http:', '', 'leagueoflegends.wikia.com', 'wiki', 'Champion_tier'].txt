Lore
Champions
in
battle
As
the
League
of
Legends
was
established
to
prevent
further
Rune
Wars
on
Valoran
,
the
neutral
aligned
summoners
called
forth
exceptional
individuals,
referred
to
as
"Champions",
to
battle
on
the
Fields
of
Justice
in
order
to
settle
disputes.
These
champions
have
joined
the
League
for
various
reasons.
Some
are
soldiers
who
have
pledged
their
allegiance
to
a
particular
nation
and
fight
in
their
nation's
interests.
Some
are
renowned
warriors
who
seek
to
prove
themselves
against
Valoran's
most
powerful
beings.
Some
are
prisoners
of
the
League,
forced
to
do
the
League's
bidding
as
punishment.
Some
may
even
be
strange
creatures
from
other
worlds,
hoping
to
bring
stability
or
further
discord
to
Runeterra
.
For
whatever
the
champion's
reason,
they
have
gained
the
interest
of
the
League
of
Legends.
Champions
in
battle
In
order
to
join
the
League,
a
potential
champion,
who
has
proven
to
possess
extraordinary
qualities,
must
travel
to
the
Institute
of
War
to
undergo
a
Judgement.
There,
a
designated
summoner
will
probe
their
mind
in
order
to
determine
the
individual's
motives.
In
truth,
the
intentions
of
the
potential
champion
has
little
bearing
on
whether
they
are
accepted
into
the
League
or
not.
The
primary
purpose
of
the
Judgement
is
to
determine
whether
the
individual
is
capable
of
exposing
their
mind
to
the
summoner,
which
would
allow
the
two
to
share
their
mental
thoughts
and
act
as
one.
Should
the
potential
champion
pass
their
Judgement,
as
well
as
agreeing
to
the
call
of
the
summon,
they
will
have
become
an
official
League
champion..
Development
Champions
in
battle
Riot
Games
develops
new
champions
for
League
of
Legends
,
and
each
champion
is
individually
designed
to
have
unique
abilities
and
traits
that
a
player
must
use
wisely.
Some
champions
use
brute
strength
and
power,
others
use
deadly
and
cunning
precision,
while
others
use
supernatural
vision
and
magic,
etc.
There
were
40
champions
released
at
launch,
with
one
released
approximately
every
two
weeks.
About
8–10
champions
are
in
development
at
any
moment.
Each
week
there
is
a
rotation
of
ten
champions
that
are
available
to
play
for
free.
For
those
that
bought
the
Collector's
Edition
,
20
champions
are
automatically
unlocked;
another
20
can
be
unlocked
by
buying
the
Champion
Bundle
through
the
game
client.
All
champions,
however,
can
be
unlocked
with
Influence
Points
or
Riot
Points
at
the
Riot
Store
in-game.

Champions

Between
a
Sad
Mummy
,
a
Madman
of
Zaun
,
a
Blind
Monk
,
a
Nine-Tailed
Fox
and
a
Dark
Child
,
the
League
of
Legends
has
seen
the
introduction
of
some
crazy,
unconventional,
and
downright
badass
characters
over
the
years.
Creating
compelling
champions
is
our
passion,
and
a
great
deal
of
care
and
effort
goes
into
handcrafting
every
one
of
them.
Your
passion
fuels
our
own,
and
we
learn
a
lot
from
your
forum
discussions
and
heated
battles
on
the
Fields
of
Justice.
In
this
Retrospective,
our
co-founders,
Brandon
“Ryze”
Beck
and
Marc
“Tryndamere”
Merrill
team
up
with
some
of
the
Rioters
behind
the
champions
to
give
you
a
taste
of
the
“secret
sauce”
that
makes
a
League

Kit
Rework
This
scale
of
rework
covers
changes
to
a
champions
kit
beyond
number
tweaks.
Animations
and
other
visual
effects
may
be
updated,
but
the
champions
model
and
core
theme
are
untouched.
In
some
cases,
the
kit
rework
will
"correct"
the
kit
to
match
the
intended
theme.
For
example:
Evelynn
,
Taric
and
Xin
Zhao
.
Fiora
[3]
Galio
[4]
Rengar
[5]
[6]
Viktor
[7]
[8]
Yorick
[9]
Urgot
[10]
Darius
[11]
Gangplank
[12]
Visual
Upgrade
This
scale
of
rework
covers
changes
to
a
champion's
model
and
artwork.
This
will
often
include
a
more
up-to-date
voice-over
and
lore,
and
may
include
bug-fixes
and
minor
balance
changes
-
but
will
not
change
the
champion's
core
theme.
For
example:
Soraka
,
Annie
and
Twisted
Fate
.
Alistar
[13]
Cho'Gath
[14]
Evelynn
[15]
Karthus
[16]
Kassadin

Model
already
finished.
[19]
Singed
[20]
Taric
[21]
Twitch
[22]
Kit
Rework
and
Visual
Upgrade
This
combines
the
above
two
categories.
The
scale
of
the
kit
rework
is
usually
slightly
larger
than
a
kit
rework
alone
as
the
developers
can
plan
for
more
in-depth
visual
effects
and
model
changes.
The
champion's
core
theme
remains
in-tact.
For
example:
Katarina
,
Master
Yi
and
Sejuani
.
Poppy
[23]
Warwick
[24]
[25]
[26]
Texture
Update
This
scale
of
rework
focuses
on
champions
whose
models,
rigs,
animations,
and
other
framework
are
in
pretty
decent
shape,
and
all
they
need
is
some
geometry
tweaking
on
the
model
and
texture
polish
for
quality
and
readability's
sake.
IronStylus
stated
that
Miss
Fortune
,
Lux
,
and
Vayne
may
be
on
the
list
for
a
"TU"
[27]
Complete
Relaunch
Unlike
the
previous
classifications,
a
complete
relaunch
involves
an
overhaul
to
the
champion's
identity
-
focusing
on
some
aspects
while
abandoning
others.
This
affects
the
champion's
lore,
personality,
art
and
model.
The
degree
of
the
kit
rework
varies.
For
example:
Karma
and
Trundle
.
Sion
[28]
[29]
Unknown
Scale
Zilean
[30]
[31]
Concept
Hinted/Leaked
An
unidentified
character
that
resembles
a
cloud
with
legs
made
an
appearance
in
Jinx's
promotional
video.
Could
this
be
an
upcoming
champion?
Zac
featured
a
similar
spoiler
in
the
Mac
trailer.
A
new
support
champion
has
been
confirmed
to
be
released
in
early
2014.
Further
information
about
this
champion
has
not
yet
