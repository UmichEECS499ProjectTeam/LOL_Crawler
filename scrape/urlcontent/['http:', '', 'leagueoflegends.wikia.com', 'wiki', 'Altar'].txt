An
altar
being
captured
An
altar
is
an
area
in
the
Twisted
Treeline
that
grants
vision
and
a
powerful
buff
to
the
team
that
controls
it.
There
are
two
altars
on
opposite
sides
of
the
map.
A
champion
captures
an
altar
by
standing
on
top
of
it
for
roughly
8
seconds.
When
more
champions
stand
on
a
single
altar,
it
is
captured
in
a
shorter
amount
of
time.
When
captured,
an
altar
seals
for
90
seconds
during
which
it
cannot
be
recaptured.
Walking
over
an
altar
or
capturing
an
enemy
altar
will
cause
you
to
be
visible
to
the
entire
enemy
team
for
the
duration.

Gameplay
When
one
altar
is
captured,
it
will
grant
+3
gold
on
kills,
much
like
Avarice
Blade
.
When
two
altars
are
captured
it
will
also
grant
+10%
attack
damage
and
ability
power.
Altars
also
give
vision
of
themselves
to
both
teams.
The
altars
each
have
their
own
sets
of
quotes
upon
being
captured.
Some
of
these
quotes
are
specific
to
champions
aligned
with
the
Shadow
Isles
.
The
amount
captured
decays
over
time
(if
a
capture
is
interrupted)
at
the
same
rate
as
it
increased
regardless
of
how
many
champions
opposed
to
the
capture
are
present.
A
capture
can
be
halted
by
having
a
champion
opposed
to
the
capturing
team
on
the
altar,
but
this
only
pauses
the
capture;
in
order
to
reverse
the
capture,
the
capturing
champion(s)
must
be
knocked
off
the
altar.
Capturing
is
unaffected
by
recalling
(in
that,
a
champion
recall
while
capturing).

Trivia
The
phrase,
"Alas,
poor
Yorick,"
is
a
reference
to
the
play
Hamlet
by
William
Shakespeare.
The
phrase,
"Morderkaiser...
are
you
also
a
prisoner?"
is
a
reference
to
the
Iron
Maiden
Song
The
Prisoner,
which
was
also
the
previous
title
of
the
Children
of
the
Grave
Buff.
The
phrase,
"Bring
out
your
dead!
Bring
out
your
dead!"
is
a
reference
to
Monty
Python
and
the
Holy
Grail.
The
west
altar
behaves
aggressively
against
the
Shadow
Isles
champions,
reminding
them
of
their
apparent
errors,
mocking
them,
and
questioning
them.
On
the
other
hand,
the
east
altar
is
friendly
to
them,
asking
them
for
help,
glorifying
them
and
offering
them
his
service.
The
West
altar
is
often
referred
to
as
the
'Lady'
and
the
east
altar
as
the
'Lord'
due
to
the
images
that
appear
after
capturing
them
and
their
voices.
Twisted
Fate's
Gate
is
a
useful
way
to
capture
both
altars
in
quick
succession
because
its
range
is
slightly
larger
than
the
distance
between
the
two
altars.
The
western
altar's
quote,
"This
place
was
once
so...
beautiful."
,
suggests
that
the
Shadow
Isles,
and
all
its
inhabitants,
were
transformed
by
some
past
event,
possibly
the
Rune
wars
.
It
is
confirmed
in
Maokai's
new
lore
that
the
Shadow
Isles
once
was
a
peaceful
place,
but
when
the
king
of
the
Shadow
Isles
ordered
his
sorcerers
to
crack
open
the
barrier
separating
life
and
death
everything
became
corrupted.
Maokai
carries
the
last
piece
of
the
former
Shadow
Isles
with
him.
The
two
spirits
that
appear
when
an
altar
is
captured
are
husband
and
wife.
They
died
there
thousands
of
years
ago.
[1]
The
face
that
the
East
Altar
is
remembering
is
most
likely
the
spirit
from
the
West
Altar,
his
wife.
The
reason
why
Evelynn
has
no
quotes
coming
from
the
altars
is
that
Riot
didn't
want
to
give
too
much
information
about
her
lore.
But
they
did,
however,
confirm
that
she
did
come
from
the
Shadow
Isles.
[2]
Riot
also
stated
that
Evelynn
and
Thresh
will
get
Altar
quotes,
but
that
this
will
need
time.
