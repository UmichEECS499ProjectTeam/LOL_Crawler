Trivia
History
Renekton
was
designed
by
Xypherous
.
Renekton
is
voiced
by
Patrick
Seitz
,
who
also
voices
Kog'Maw
,
Lucian
and
Rengar
.
Renekton
was
first
revealed
in
the
Journal
of
Justice,
Volume
1
Issue
8,
as
the
brother
of
Nasus
,
though
his
name
was
spelled
Renekhton
there.
It
should
be
noted
however
that
Renekton
has
technically
been
in
the
lore
as
long
as
Nasus
has,
as
the
story
of
the
conflict
between
the
two
brothers
has
been
in
Nasus's
backstory
from
the
start.
His
title
was
previously
The
Eater
of
Souls
,
but
was
changed
to
the
current
title
by
Riot
after
his
sneak
peek.
Cull
the
Meek
was
originally
called
Tyrant’s
Reach
but
was
changed
with
the
release
of
the
Champion
Spotlight
for
unknown
reasons.
Renekton's
Art
Spotlight
is
the
only
one
that
is
not
of
his
original
skin,
but
his
Outback
skin.
References
Renekton
and
Nasus
both
bear
resemblance
to
old
Egyptian
Gods,
namely
Sobek
and
Anubis
.
However,
Renekton's
lore
is
more
resemblant
of
Ammit
,
a
half-crocodile
demon
that,
upon
Anubis's
judgment
of
a
heart
being
impure,
would
eat
the
heart
of
the
impure
one.
This
is
similar
to
Renekton's
judgment
of
who
was
worthy
of
receiving
Nasus'
teachings.
In
his
lore,
it
states
that
he
awakens
in
the
sewers
of
Zaun
.
This
is
a
reference
to
the
urban
legend
that
crocodiles
live
in
the
sewers
of
various
large
cities.
Renekton's
blade-weapon
may
be
a
reference
to
the
Klingon
bat'leth,
from
the
Star
Trek
series.
Although,
Renekton's
blade
has
the
grips
on
the
inside
edge
of
the
blade
where
as
a
traditional
bat'leth
has
them
on
the
outside
edge
of
the
blade.
Thus
it
could
be
a
reference
to
the
protagonist's
weapon
in
the
Manhwa
Jackals,
weapon
that
can
be
seen
here
in
the
front.
Renekton
references
Nasus
in
his
in-game
quotes.
He
is
one
of
the
few
champions
who
references
another
champion
in-game.
Ability
Comparison
Because
Renekton
uses
the
fury
system,
his
spells
don't
cost
any
mana
,
energy
or
life
to
be
used.
The
fury
gained
through
attacks
is
used
to
empower
them
only.
The
icon
for
Renekton's
Slice
and
Dice
is
similar
to
the
icon
for
Caitlyn
's
Ace
in
the
Hole
.
His
ability
"Slice
and
Dice"
makes
reference
to
cut
something
into
small
pieces
to
analyze
it,
and
is
another
reference
to
"blind
violence".
Like
his
brother's
ultimate
Fury
of
the
Sands
,
Renekton's
ultimate
Dominus
makes
him
bigger,
gives
him
more
health,
and
damages
surrounding
enemies.
The
name
of
his
ultimate,
Dominus
,
means
master
or
owner
in
Latin.
Quotes
In
the
Polish
version,
Renekton's
/joke
and
/taunt
are
both
quotes
from
a
YouTube
video
that's
popular
in
Poland.
It
is
worth
noting,
however,
that
curse
words
are
substituted
with
their
less
offensive
counterparts.
Renekton
shares
a
quote
with
Mordekaiser
:
"Carnage"
.
Renekton's
taunt
makes
reference
to
Osiris
in
Egyptian
lore.
The
quote
"Come
back
when
you've
collected
all
the
bits
of
yourself"
makes
double
reference:
one
to
the
champion
he
kills
and
one
to
the
lore
of
the
egyptian
gods,
since
Osiris
needed
to
recover
all
his
body
parts
in
order
to
return
and
claim
his
position
as
a
true
god.
Renekton's
joke
refers
to
the
birds
that
are
usually
found
on
alligator
mouths
cleaning
them
from
food
remains.
Skins
Outback
Renekton
skin
is
a
reference
to
Crocodile
Dundee
.
In
the
Outback
Renekton
skin
his
scales
appear
brown
in
the
splash
art,
in-game
they
are
cobalt
blue.The
brown
is
the
underbelly
of
this
skin.
Galactic
Renekton
and
Galactic
Nasus
skins
are
most
likely
a
reference
to
the
Egyptian
gods
of
the
Stargate
series.
While
standing
in
brush
with
the
Bloodfury
Renekton
skin,
his
tongue
will
sometimes
remain
opaque
while
the
rest
of
his
body
is
translucent.
This
does
not
affect
detection
from
outside
the
brush.
When
Ruthless
Predator
is
activated
on
the
Rune
Wars
Renekton
skin
his
eyes
turn
from
red
to
green
In
Pool
Party
Renekton's
skin
splash
art,
you
can
see
Gragas
and
Lulu
on
the
diving
board.
Ahri
,
Urf
and
Zac
climbing
the
ladder
and
Poolparty
Ziggs
diving
down.
You
can
also
see
Kha'Zix
,
Ryze
,
Teemo
and
what
appears
to
be
Karthus
on
the
second
diving
board.
Scorched
Earth
Renekton
bears
a
strong
resembance
to
Deathwing
from
the
World
of
Warcraft
franchise.
Relations
Renekton
and
Nasus
are
brothers.
