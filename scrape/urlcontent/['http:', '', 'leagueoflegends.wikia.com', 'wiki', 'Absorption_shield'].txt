Shields
are
not
to
be
confused
with
armor
and
magic
resistance
bonuses.
Jarvan
IV
uses
Golden
Aegis
to
grant
himself
a
shield
Shield
refers
to
the
game
mechanic
which
grants
temporary
health
to
a
champion
for
some
time.
These
shields
absorb
a
set
amount
of
damage
before
it
disappears,
whether
because
it
reached
its
capacity
of
damage
absorption
or
because
its
duration
ran
out.
It
is
marked
by
an
extra
white
bar
in
the
champion
's
health
bar.
Most
of
these
shields
are
granted
by
champion
abilities

Shield
types
Shields
are
classified
by
the
type
of
damage
they
absorb.
Most
of
them
absorb
all
types
of
damage
,
including
true
damage
.
Magic
shields
absorb
only
magic
damage
.
They
appear
purple
instead
of
the
normal
white,
and
champions
with
magic
shields
take
direct
damage
to
their
health
from
physical
and
true
damage.
All
Shields
take
the
champion's
resistances
into
account
when
receiving
damage
to
the
temporary
health.
Spell
shields,
which
allow
you
to
completely
block
the
effect
of
one
single
ability,
are
not
considered
a
type
of
shield.
Some
"shields"
such
as
Leona's
Eclipse
grant
armor
,
magic
resistance
or
damage
reduction
when
activated,
but
as
these
don't
give
any
"temporary
health"
they
are
not
considered
Shields.
