streaks
work.

(not

death
streaks.
Using
Summoner
Teleport
on
a
ward
will
no
longer
reveal
the
ward
through
fog
of
war
to
enemies.
Instead,
it
will
destealth
the
ward

seen
if
an
enemy
is
near

reveal
the
teleport
particle
through
fog
of
war

another.

in-game
option

is
now
more
predictable
(now

closest
enemy).

now
target

attack-move
cursor
color
to
red
from
green.
Added
new
keybindings
for
"Self+Smart
Cast"

abilities
and
Summoner

Casting
with
these
binds
will
first
try
to
Smart-Cast
the
ability;
if
there
is
no
target
or
an
invalid
target
under
the
cursor,
it
will
attempt
to
Self-Cast
the
ability.
Fixed

bug
where
clones
did
not
show
items
in
their
inventories.
Fixed
a
bug
where
certain
particle
effects
would
not
show
up
if
using

errors
on
Kayle
,
Soraka

triggering
on-cast
events
more
than
once.

get
stuck
in
a
"dead"
state
until
they
disconnected
and
then
reconnected.

Changes
Champions
Janna

General
The
innate
ability
of
each
champion
can
now
be
seen
by
browsing
through
the
champions
tab
of
each
champion,
whereas
before,
only
the
levelable
abilities
were
shown.
After
the
game
ends
and
the
Victory/Defeat
sign
appears,
all
units
will
still
move
and
continue
to
be
animated.
Ping
message
changed
from
"X
has
marked
the
Y
Building"
to
"X
requests
aid
at
the
Y
Building"

pinging
allied
buildings.
Now,
you
cannot
ping
a
set
amount
of
times

a
certain
timeframe.
