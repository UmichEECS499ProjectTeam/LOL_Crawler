Trivia
This
item
is
a
reference
to
both
the
player
Wriggle
and
the
character
Wriggle
Nightbug
from
the
Touhou
Project
series.
In
the
V1.0.0.115
(April
Fool's
Day)
patch,
Wriggle's
Lantern
was
given
the
following:
Unique
Passive
:
Taunts

Jaxes
(both
enemy
and
allied).
Lore
Strange
Artifact
Discovered
in
Kumungu
Piltover
prodigy
donates
artifact
to
the
Institute
of
War
Reira
Kashuld
reporting
from
the
Arcanum
Majoris
Piltover's
Master
Pathfinder
and
champion
of
the
League
,
Ezreal
,
recently
returned
from
a
successful
archeological
expedition
to
Kumungu
,
the
mysterious
jungle
region
located
beyond
the
Great
Barrier
,
deep
within
the
southern
half
of
continental
Valoran
.
"Kumungu
is
a
dangerous
place
for
most,
but
danger
is
of
no
concern
to
me,"
Ezreal
announced
during
a
special
presentation
to
the
Arcanum
Majoris,
the
League's
scholastic
branch
based
in
the
Institute
of
War
.
"New
expeditions
(to
Kumungu)?
Count
on
it."
During
the
event,
Ezreal
stunned
the
assembled
scholars
by
unveiling
and
donating
an
artifact
he
discovered
during
his
expedition.
It
is
expected
to
be
sanctioned
for
use
in
League
matches
once
the
object
can
be
duplicated
and
its
duplicates
are
fully
tested
in
the
League's
Public
Trials
and
Resolutions
battle
arena.
To
the
untrained
eye,
the
artifact
may
appear
to
be
merely
a
mundane
lantern.
"It's
much
more
than
that,"
said
Professor
Alowicious
Chucat,
Lead
Archaeologist
for
the
Arcanum
Majoris.
"Upon
closer
examination
we
discovered
a
name
etched
in
the
base
of
the
Lantern."
Indicating
the
weathered
engraving
of
the
name
Wriggle
,
Chucat
continued,
"It
would
seem
that
this
was
an
important
artifact
for
whoever
originally
owned
it.
Judging
by
the
bladed
edges
on
the
bottom
and
the
well-worn
handle,
it
has
definitely
seen
combat.
I
surmise
that
it
was
likely
used
to
ward
off
predatory
animals
native
to
the
region.
It
is
definitely
a
tool
specially
crafted
for
jungle
navigation."
Scholars
universally
agree
that
Kumungu
could
hold
a
wealth
of
valuable
artifacts.
Unfortunately,
the
dangers
associated
with
such
a
savage
and
mysterious
realm
have
not
deterred
a
recent
rush
of
amateur
explorers
to
the
area.
Subsequently,
the
League
has
issued
an
advisory
against
such
expeditions.
"Most
who
fancy
themselves
adventurers
or
archaeologists
are
in
fact
neither,"
Chucat
further
commented.
"Many
who
hear
of
Ezreal
's
exploits
think
they
can
do
something
similar.
It
is
important
to
remember
that
not
only
is
Ezreal
a
League
champion,
but
he
is
also
the
lead
explorer
for
a
city-state.
Leave
dangerous
exploration
to
the
professionals."
