League
of
Legends
v1.0.0.105
Champions
Irelia,
the
Will
of
the
Blades
(
Original
Stats
)
Bladesurge
:
Irelia
dashes
forward
to
strike
her
target.
If
it
kills
the
target,
Bladesurge's
cooldown
refreshes
and
half
the
mana
cost
is
refunded.
Hiten
Style
:
Irelia
is
skilled
in
the
art
of
Hiten,
passively
giving
her
physical
attacks
health
restoration.
Activating
Hiten
Style
adds
true
damage
to
her
physical
attacks
for
a
short
duration.
Equilibrium
Strike
:
Irelia's
attack
balances
the
scales,
dealing
damage
and
slowing
the
target.
However,
if
the
target
has
a
higher
Health
%
than
Irelia,
then
the
blow
stuns
the
target
instead.
Transcendent
Blades
(Ultimate):
Irelia
summons
four
spirit
blades
which
she
can
fling
at
her
enemies.
These

deal

to
enemies
that
they
pass
through,
siphoning
life
from
them
and
healing
Irelia.
Ionian

(Innate):
Each
nearby
enemy
champion
(to
a
maximum
of
three)
reduces
the
effectiveness
of

Sad
Mummy
:

deals
150/250/350
damage
upfront
rather
than

damage
over
the
duration.
It
is
now
consistent
with
other
similar
skills
(
Dark
Binding
,

)
and
will
deal
damage
to
Black
Shield
.
Fixed
a
bug
where

could
trap

inside
for
the
duration.

effects
of

current

now
immediately
