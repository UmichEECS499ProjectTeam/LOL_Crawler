Unlike
most
forms
of
on-hit
physical
damage,
Denting
Blows'
bonus
damage
does
not
apply
life
steal.
This
is
a
special
case,
perhaps
to
prevent
abuse
or
for
flavor.
The
triggering
attack
will
still
apply
life
steal.
Denting
Blows'

the

or
using
abilities
on
different
targets
will
not
remove
Denting
Blows'
stacking
debuff.
Denting
Blows'
attack
speed
buff
will
not
stack
with
itself
with
repeated
applications,
nor
will
it
stack
from

it
on
multiple
targets
in
quick
succession.
