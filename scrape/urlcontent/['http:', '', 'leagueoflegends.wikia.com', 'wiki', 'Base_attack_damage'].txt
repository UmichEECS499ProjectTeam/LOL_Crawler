Base
attack
damage
Attack
damage
(or
AD
)
directly
increases
the
physical
damage
of
a
unit's
autoattack
and
also
improves
the
damage
some
champion
abilities
too.
Every
champion
starts
with
some
base
attack
damage
that
increases
each
level.
Additionally,
several
items
and
champion
abilities,
as
well
as
spells,
buffs,
runes
and
masteries
grant
bonus
attack
damage
.
The
champion's
total
attack
damage
is
the
base
attack
damage
plus
the
bonus
attack
damage.
This
statistic
stacks
additively
in
most
circumstances.
When
there
are
percentile
attack
damage
bonuses,
they
are
first
added
together
if
there
are
several
sources
and
then
they
multiply
the
total
attack
damage
of
the
champion.
At
level
18,
base
attack
damage
ranges
from
85.
6
(
Thresh
)
to
129.
7
(
Cho'Gath
and
Skarner
).
Attack
Damage
has
a
theoretical
gold
value
of
36
gold
per
unit.
This
means
that
B.
F.
Sword
and
Pickaxe
are
the
most
efficient
AD
core
items,
with
a
gold/AD
ratio
of
34.
4
and
35
respectively.
The
costs
of
these
stats
are
always
offset
by
increased
final
costs
of
their
upgraded
items,
so
The
Bloodthirster
and
Infinity
Edge
still
break
even
at
36
gold
per
1
AD
.
