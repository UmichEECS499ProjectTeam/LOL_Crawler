Background

Trivia
Skill
usage
Xerath
range
has
the
potential
for
both
strong
harass
and
farm.
Arcanopulse
is
best
used
to
harras,
but
it
can
also
be
used
to
hit
an
entire
line
of
minions.
Eye
of
Destruction
is
great
for
farming
since
it
does
the
most
damage,
minions
don't
dodge.
An
early
point
into
Shocking
Orb
can
help
keep
you
safe
from
ganks
as
you
can
stun
anyone
who
comes
close,
but
it
should
generally
be
maxed
last,
as
it
is
hard
to
use
in
lane
with
minions.
However,
he
does
have
a
weaknesses.
You
will
need
to
occasionally
attack
a
minion
or
champion
with
an
auto-attack
to
maintain
your
mana,
as
Xerath's
mana
costs
are
very
high,
If
there
are
no
minions
nearby,
consider
auto-attacking
a
wraith
to
gain
the
passive
mana.
2
good
combo's
are
Use
the
stun
from
Shocking
Orb
to
land
an
easy
bullseye
with
Eye
of
Destruction
and
a
quick
Arcanopulse
.
This
will
deal
the
maximum
damage.
Use
the
slow
from
Eye
of
Destruction
to
help
you
land
Shocking
Orb
,
and
follow
up
with
Arcanopulse
.
This
will
deal
less
damage,
but
is
easier
to
land.
Xerath
is
one
of
the
most
damaging
mages,
along
with
his
range
allowing
him
to
build
full
offense,
but
he
has
2
major
weaknesses:
His
abilities
are
all
skill
shots,
and
can
be
avoided.
Xerath
is
very
mana-hungry,
his
passive
requires
him
to
get
close.
In
team
fights
Xerath
deals
severe
AoE
damage,
and
is
very
effective
against
enemies
that
are
tightly
grouped..
Rite
of
the
Arcane
has
amazing
range
and
massive
damage,
however
it's
delay
and
small
area
make
it
easy
for
unhindered
enemies
to
dodge.
Thus
it
is
best
used
in
conjunction
with
an
ally.
Allowing
Xerath
to
turn
a
1v1
into
a
1v2.
It
is
also
great
for
stealing
objectives.
He
can
reach
both
dragon
and
baron
from
mid
lane.
Rite
of
the
Arcane
's
immunity
to
displacement
effects
can
be
used
defensively
against
Blitzcrank's
grab
or
Gragis's
ult.
Xerath
has
several
options
for
summoner
spells:
Ignite
is
generally
a
poor
choice
since
xerath
is
rarely
close
enough
to
use
it.
Flash
is
best
used
for
defense,
as
xerath
already
has
long
range.
Teleport
allows
for
better
lane-control
and
opens
some
gank-options.
Barrier
can
help
you
survive
against
assassins,
one
of
xerath's
major
weaknesses.
Cleanse
is
generally
a
poor
choice,
since
you
have
no
escape
to
capitalize
on
it.
Exhaust
has
a
short
range,
but
protects
you
from
some
of
your
counters
who
have
to
rely
on
getting
close
in
order
to
kill
you,
namely
Fizz
and
Ahri
.
It
also
slows
down
targets
so
you
can
more
reliably
hit
with
all
your
attacks.
Smite
is
generally
a
poor
choice
as
xerath
can
already
deal
high
damage
to
minions,
and
does
very
poorly
in
the
jungle.
Clairvoyance
,
combined
with
Xerath
's
extraordinary
range,
allows
you
to
control
the
enemy
buffs
without
putting
yourself
into
real
danger,
in
addition
to
greatly
improving
map-
and
objective-control.
It
also
allows
you
to
snipe
recalling
champions.
Clarity
is
not
viable
because
of
Xerath's
passive
and
high
mana
cost.
Build
usage
Xerath
's
range
can
allow
him
to
build
full
offensive
with
Cooldown
Reduction,
Ability
Power,
Magic
Penetration,
and
some
Mana
regeneration
to
power
it.
â€‹
2
Core
items
are
the
Athene's
Unholy
Grail
or
Morellonomicon
,
which
gives
you
AP,
Mana,
and
CDR
in
good
amounts.
Athene's
Unholy
Grail
is
the
more
defensive
option,
giving
you
MR,
and
more
mana
regeneration,
allowing
you
to
stay
away
more
often.
Morellonomicon
is
the
more
offensive
option,
giving
you
more
AP,
and
being
400
cheaper,
but
you
will
need
to
move
closer
to
gain
mana
from
your
passive
more
often.
While
Morellonomicon
combined
with
Athene's
Unholy
Grail
will
let
you
hit
40%
CDR,
it
is
not
recommended
to
get
both.
5
points
in
sorcery
mastery,
along
either
CDR
glyphs/Quints,
blue
buff,
or
Ionian's
boots
of
lucidity
can
get
you
to
the
40%
cap.
Rabadon's
Deathcap
should
be
bought
right
after
hitting
the
CDR
cap.
It
provides
a
large
boost
in
damage.
Void
Staff
will
help
you
against
target's
that
stack
magic
resist,
and
combine
nicely
with
Haunting
Guise,
and/or
Sorcerer
Boots.
Building
Zhonya's
Hourglass
will
give
you
Ability
power
,
armor,
and
a
powerful
active
that
can
help
you
survive
if
the
enemy
team
has
gapclosing
abilities.
Rylais
Crystal
Scepter
can
slow
people
down,
making
it
easier
to
land
more
attacks.

Countering
Xerath's
deals
magic
damage,
magic
resist
is
the
obvious
counter
(
Banshee's
Veil
).
While
all
of
Xerath's
spells
have
a
very
long
range,
they
are
also
all
delayed
and/or
skill
shots
and
can
be
dodged.
As
such,
he
is
vulnerable
to
high
mobility
characters,
such
as
Ezreal
,
Diana
,
Kassadin
,
Ahri
,
and
Fizz
.
Evelynn
is
also
a
strong
counter
Xerath's
as
her
stealth
can
negate
his
long
range
advantage.
Speed
(
Boots
of
Swiftness
)
may
be
a
better
stat
then
magic
resist
(
Mercury's
Treads
)
against
Xerath's
.
Xerath's
is
most
powerful
late
game,
especially
with
full
items.
Try
to
stop
and
starve
him
early.
Xerath's
mana
can
be
depleted
quickly
and
he
needs
to
come
in
short
range
for
his
passive
to
work.
Try
and
make
him
waste
his
attacks,
and
then
counter
when
he
is
out
of
mana.
With
his
long
range
Xerath's
can
be
a
threat
to
other
lanes,
notify
your
team
if
he
leaves
your
lane.
Most
of
Xerath's
attacks
are
AoE,
try
to
stay
spread
out
in
team
fights.
Avoid
getting
hit
by
his
Shocking
Orb
,
as
the
stun
gives
him
ample
opportunity
to
land
his
combo.
Observing
Xerath
can
help
you
to
dodge
his
Arcanopulse
.
When
you
see
Xerath
slow
down,
it's
time
to
start
dodging
left
or
right,
perpendicular
to
the
imaginary
line
between
you
and
Xerath.
This
gives
you
extra
warning
to
dodge
the
Q
in
addition
to
the
Q's
lit
warning
track.
Casting
Rite
of
the
Arcane
makes
Xerath
immobile,
and
makes
him
immune
to
displacements.
However,
hard
CC
like
stuns
and
silences
interrupt
his
ultimate
and
put
it
on
cooldown,
so
saving
these
for
when
he
casts
his
ultimate
is
worth
it.
When
Xerath
uses
his
ultimate,
a
large
circle
quickly
expands
from
it.
This
circle
is
visible
by
everyone,
and
it
indicates
his
maximum
cast
range.
Use
this
to
your
advantage,
and
keep
in
mind
that
his
ultimate
is
an
AoE.
