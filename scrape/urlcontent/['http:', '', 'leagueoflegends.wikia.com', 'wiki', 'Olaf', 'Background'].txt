Most
men
would
say
that
death
is
a
thing
to
be
feared;
none
of
those
men
would
be
Olaf.
The
Berserker
lives
only
for
the
roar
of
a
battle
cry
and
the
clash
of
steel.
Spurred
on
by
his
hunger
for
glory
and
the
looming
curse
of
a
forgettable
death,
Olaf
throws
himself
into
every
fight
with
reckless
abandon.
Surrendering
to
the
bloodlust
deep
within
his
being,
Olaf
is
only
truly
alive
when
grappling
with
the
jaws
of
death.
The
coastal
peninsula
of
Lokfar
is
among
the
most
brutal
places
in
the
Freljord
.
There,
rage
is
the
only
fire
to
warm
frozen
bones,
blood
is
the
only
liquid
that
flows
freely,
and
there
is
no
worse
fate
than
to
grow
old,
frail,
and
forgotten.
Olaf
was
a
warrior
of
Lokfar
with
no
shortage
of
glories
and
no
hesitation
to
share
them.
While
boasting
one
evening
with
his
clansmen
over
the
burning
embers
of
a
razed
village,
one
of
the
elder
warriors
grew
tired
of
Olaf's
bluster.
The
old
fighter
goaded
Olaf
to
read
the
omens
and
see
if
Olaf's
fortunes
matched
his
gloating.
Emboldened
by
the
challenge,
Olaf
mocked
the
aged
raider's
envy
and
tossed
the
knuckle
bones
of
a
long-dead
beast
to
predict
the
heights
of
glory
he'd
achieve
in
death.
All
mirth
left
the
gathering
as
the
clansmen
read
the
portents:
the
bones
spoke
of
a
long
life
and
a
quiet
passing.
Infuriated,
Olaf
stormed
into
the
night
determined
to
prove
the
prediction
false
by
finding
and
slaughtering
Lokfar's
feared
frost
serpent.
The
monster
had
consumed
thousands,
man
and
ship
alike,
in
its
long
lifetime
and
to
die
in
battle
with
it
would
be
a
fitting
end
for
any
warrior.
As
Olaf
hurled
himself
into
the
blackness
of
its
maw,
he
fell
deeper
into
the
blackness
of
his
mind.
When
the
shock
of
freezing
water
roused
him
from
the
dark,
there
was
only
the
butchered
carcass
of
the
beast
afloat
beside
him.
Thwarted
but
not
defeated,
Olaf
set
out
to
hunt
down
every
legendary
creature
with
claws
and
fangs,
hoping
that
the
next
battle
would
be
his
last.
Each
time
he
charged
headlong
toward
his
coveted
death,
only
to
be
spared
by
the
frenzy
that
washed
over
him
while
on
its
brink.
Olaf
concluded
that
no
mere
beast
could
grant
him
a
warrior's
death.
His
solution
was
to
take
on
the
most
fearsome
tribe
in
the
Freljord:
the
Winter's
Claw
.
Sejuani
appeared
amused
by
Olaf's
challenge
to
her
warband,
but
his
audacity
would
earn
him
no
mercy.
She
ordered
the
charge
and
sent
scores
of
her
warriors
to
overwhelm
Olaf.
One
by
one,
they
fell
until
he
lost
himself
in
the
bloodlust
once
again,
effortlessly
cutting
a
path
to
the
leader
of
the
Winter's
Claw.
The
clash
between
Olaf
and
Sejuani
rocked
the
glaciers
with
its
force,
and
though
he
seemed
unstoppable,
Sejuani
battled
the
berserker
to
a
standstill.
As
they
stood
deadlocked,
Sejuani's
glare
penetrated
Olaf's
berserker
haze
in
a
way
no
weapon
ever
could.
His
frenzy
abated
long
enough
for
her
to
make
him
an
offer:
Sejuani
swore
that
she
would
find
Olaf
his
glorious
death
if
he
would
lend
his
axe
to
her
campaign
of
conquest.
In
that
moment,
Olaf
vowed
he
would
carve
his
legacy
into
the
Freljord
itself.
"When
you
meet
your
ancestors,
tell
them
Olaf
sent
you."
―
Olaf
On
an
uncharted
continent
beyond
Valoran's
grasping
clutches,
the
conqueror
named
Olaf
was
born
to
a
long
tradition
of
soldiers
unlike
most
others.
Berserkers,
as
they
tout
themselves,
are
warriors
who
channel
fury
deep
from
their
cores,
unleashing
pure
and
savage
wrath
upon
their
enemies.
This
fearsome
evolution
is
a
product
of
their
unforgiving
home,
Lokfar
–
a
barren
tundra
where
all
creatures
must
vie
bitterly
for
every
resource.
Olaf
belonged
to
a
seafaring
clan
known
for
ruthlessly
pillaging
any
and
all
villages
within
reach
of
their
dragon-crested
longboats.
The
last
time
he
saw
his
icy
home,
Olaf
was
embarking
on
an
expedition
to
pioneer
and
plunder
a
distant
land
known
only
to
legend.
However,
while
underway,
a
terrible
storm
sprung
up
and
Olaf
and
his
crew
were
thrown
to
the
mercy
of
a
roiling
and
pitiless
sea.
His
ship
destroyed,
his
crew
nowhere
to
be
found,
Olaf
miraculously
washed
up
untold
miles
from
"friendly"
waters
on
the
foreign
shores
of
Valoran,
south
of
Demacia
.
This
unfamiliar
place
stunned
and
frightened
the
Berserker,
for
Lokfar
is
not
privy
to
such
potent
magicians.
Approaching
them,
Olaf
hoped
that
they
could
use
their
mysterious
powers
to
send
him
back
to
his
people.
A
bargain
was
struck.
Olaf
would
use
his
awesome
prowess
as
a
warrior
to
serve
the
unusual
wars
of
Valoran
in
the
League
of
Legends
,
and
in
exchange
the
sorcerers
would
find
him
a
way
to
return.
Despite
his
participation
in
the
League,
Olaf
knows
better
than
to
trust
the
"finger
wagglers"
that
run
the
Institute
of
War.
He
deliberately
keeps
details
of
his
life
and
home
from
them.
After
all,
with
enough
information,
they
would
most
certainly
find
the
Lokfarians
and
dominate
them
as
they
have
dominated
all
of
Valoran,
keeping
both
quietly
–
and
unwittingly
–
in
their
thrall.
"Beware
the
war
cry
of
the
Berserker.
What
surges
toward
you
is
unyielding,
free
from
the
shackles
of
reason."

Sneak
Peek
Annoucement
made

the
sneak
peek
by
ByronicHero
:
As
you
may
have
observed
throughout
your
time
in
Runeterra,
the
League
of
Legends
Design
Team
seeks
to
promote
synergy
whenever
possible
(like
a
boss).
Between
champions
with
guns,
champions
with
cultural
ties,
and
champions
under
five
feet
tall,
there
are
a
ton
of
ways
that
our
champions
synergize
with
one
another.
We
felt
that
the
champion,
Sion
,
however,
didn't
have
enough
kindred
spirits
at
his
disposal.
This
is
an
important
issue!
We're
talking
about
ensuring
that
an
important
subculture
in
the
League
of
Legends
gets
equal
representation!
That
subculture
is,
of
course:
vicious,
axe-wielding
maniacs.
To
bolster
the
ranks
of
this
often
under
appreciated
demographic,
we're
pleased
to
be
able
to
introduce
Olaf,
the
Berserker.
And
just
to
make
sure
he
fits
the
bill
exactly,
this
guy
actually
has
a
pair
of
axes.
So
strap
on
the
nearest
helmet,
sharpen
your
great
sword,
and
raise
an
ice
cold
flagon
of
mead
in
honor
of
Olaf,
the
latest
champion
to
grace
the
Field
of
Justice.
