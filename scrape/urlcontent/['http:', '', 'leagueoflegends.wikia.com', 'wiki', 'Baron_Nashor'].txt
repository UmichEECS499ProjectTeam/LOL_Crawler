Baron
Nashor's
camp
location
in
Summoner's
Rift.
Baron
Nashor
is
the
most
powerful
neutral
monster
on
Summoner's
Rift
in
League
of
Legends
.
It
is
described
in-game
as
follows:
"This
is
a
very
powerful
hostile
monster,
approach
with
caution!
Killing
this
monster
will
yield
great
monetary
and
magical
rewards
to
the
team,
but
it
should
not
be
confronted
alone"
.
Killing
the
Baron
gives
the
Exalted
with
Baron
Nashor
buff
to
all
living
champions
on
the
team,
which
lasts
4
minutes
total
(
Runic
Affinity
doesn't
work
on
this
buff).
This
buff
gives
massively
increased
attack
damage
and
ability
power
as
well
as
a
bonus
to
health
and
mana
regeneration.
When
Nashor
is
killed,
each
player
on
the
team
is
also
granted
the
following:

Lore
The
Journal
of
Justice
clarifies
this
about
Baron
Nashor
[1]
:
The
many
neutral
monsters
on
the
Fields
of
Justice
are
constructs
inspired
by
real
creatures
from
Runeterra.
The
Baron
Nashor
you
see
on
the
map
is
actually
an
incomplete
facsimile
of
the
true
Baron
Nashor,
who
is
now
the
subject
of
myth
and
legend.
The
story
goes
that
Baron
Nashor
was
a
ferocious
worm
that
ruled
the
Serpentine
River,
which
flows
through
Summoner’s
Rift.
He
was
such
a
fearsome
and
powerful
beast
that
even
the
armies
of
Demacia
and
Noxus
steered
clear
of
the
river,
unwilling
to
chance
an
encounter
with
the
Baron.
When
Summoner’s
Rift
was
constructed,
the
Baron
vanished,
leaving
no
conclusive
evidence
as
to
where
he
went
or
why
he
left
in
the
first
place.
Obviously
the
rumor-mill
has
churned
out
many
explanations,
but
all
we
know
for
sure
is
that
the
Senior
Arcane
Architect
for
the
Summoner’s
Rift
arena
was
said
to
have
crafted
the
version
you
see
today
from
no
more
than
a
molted
scale
and
interviews
with
those
who
had
seen
the
beast
and
lived.
Abilities
Baron
Nashor
has
four
abilities.
While
they
are
not
revealed
in-game
on
a
death
screen,
their
debuffs
and
animations
are
visible
and
distinctive.
Name
Description
Crowd
Control
Immunity
(Innate)
:
Baron
Nashor
is
rendered
immune
to
any
form
of
crowd
control.
Wrath
of
the
Ancients
Deals
70
magic
damage
and
applies
a
debuff
which
increases
magic
damage
taken
by
25%
per
stack,
stacking
every
half
second
up
to
ten
times.
This
increase
in
damage
is
applied
to
the
damage
taken
before
magic
resistance
,
and
while
functioning
in
a
similar
manner
to
magic
resistance
reduction,
it
is
not
the
same
thing.
Voracious
Corrosion
Deals
physical
damage
and
applies
a
non-stacking
debuff
that
reduces
damage
dealt
to
baron
by
50%.
This
makes
trying
to
solo
baron
difficult.
Sweeping
Blow
Knocks
all
champions
away
from
the
Baron
by
600
range.
This
range
is
equivalent
to
the
distance
between
the
Baron
and
the
entrance
to
his
locale.
Fluid
Knockup
/
Propelled
[2]
Similar
to
Cho'Gath's
Rupture
which
knocks
up
and
slows
the
target.
A
green
puddle
of
bubbling
fluid
shows
on
the
ground
before
the
spell
hits,
making
it
relatively
easy
to
spot
and
subsequently
dodge
it.
Baron
Nashor
will
usually
start
with
Wrath
of
the
Ancients.
He
will
continue
using
Wrath
of
the
Ancients
unless
he
feels
you
are
doing
too
much
physical
damage,
at
which
point
he
will
start
using
Voracious
Corrosion
to
keep
its
debuff
on
you
while
alternating
with
Wrath
for
damage.
He
will
mix
in
the
knockback
and
knockup
moderately
often
throughout
the
fight.
Additionally,
Baron
Nashor
has
the
passive
ability
to
knock
back
any
wards
and
Teemo's
Noxious
Trap
being
placed
too
close
to
its
body
for
a
short
range.
Noxious
Traps
are
pushed
far
enough
away
so
that
their
splash
damage
does
not
reach
Baron
Nashor.
Wards
are
pushed
away
so
that
they
are
not
placed
inside
Baron
Nashor;
otherwise,
the
ward
would
be
untargetable
and
unable
to
be
destroyed
without
first
killing
Baron
Nashor.
Gameplay
Due
to
the
debuffs
that
the
Baron
can
apply
to
you,
it
is
highly
recomended
that
you
have
full
vision
of
the
enemy
team,
as
the
stacking
debuff
applied
(25%
x
10
times
=
250%
Damage
Increase)
renders
your
team
EXTREMELY
vulnerable
to
AOE
magic
damage
casters
since
the
increase
in
magic
damage
devastates
your
team
from
any
source
of
magic
damage
(including
most
global
ultimates).
Baron
Nashor
is
often
a
key
objective
in
competitive
games
because
of
its
massive
gold
bonus
(+300g/player)
and
global
buff.
The
killer
receives
an
additional
25
bonus
gold.
Baron
Nashor
is
immune
to
all
forms
of
Crowd
Control
.
Killing
him
should
not
be
attempted
until
mid
or
late
game.
Due
to
its
power
you
should
not
attempt
to
solo
it,
this
feat
is
usually
not
possible
unless
you
have
a
full
item
build
with
a
lot
of
survivability.
Killing
Baron
with
a
team
is
fairly
simple.
Baron
primarily
attacks
the
target
closest
to
him
so
you
can
distribute
damage
by
positioning
characters
closer
or
farther
away
from
him.
The
enemy
team
likely
will
have
a
ward
placed
to
see
when
yours
initiates
on
Baron.
If
you
do
not
destroy
these
wards
with
the
use
of
a
Vision
Ward
or
Sweeping
Lens
,
they
may
be
able
to
assault
your
team
while
you
are
weakened
by
Baron
and
subsequently
steal
the
Exalted
with
Baron
Nashor
buff/kill
several
players,
putting
you
at
a
disadvantage.
Baron
Nashor's
Exalted
with
Baron
Nashor
buff
is
given
to
the
team
that
deals
the
killing
blow
on
Baron.
This
mechanic
means
that
even
if
one
team
is
incapable
of
directly
fighting
the
enemy
team,
a
jungler
with
the
Smite
summoner
spell
can
possibly
swoop
in
and
steal
the
Baron
with
a
well
timed
Smite
.
This
is
almost
definitely
a
suicide
mission
and
is
an
extremely
high
risk
maneuver.
However,
successfully
stealing
Baron
can
turn
the
tide
of
a
game
dramatically.
Being
able
to
steal
or
prevent
the
stealing
of
Baron
(or
other
key
monsters)
is
also
the
main
argument
for
junglers
to
always
have
Smite,
even
if
they
can
deal
with
monster
camps
without
it.
In
the
same
vein,
Champions
possessing
abilities
with
a
considerable
range
can
attempt
to
do
the
same
with
less
risk
by
dealing
the
killing
blow
from
a
distance.
However,
this
is
difficult
to
attempt
because
perfect
timing
and
clear
vision
of
the
battle
are
required
to
pull
it
off.
Some
Champions
that
can
do
this
are:
Draven
,
Ezreal
,
Gragas
,
Janna
,
Jayce
,
Jinx
,
Kog'Maw
,
Lux
,
Nidalee
,
Varus
,
Xerath
,
Ziggs
.
When
Baron
dies,
the
Exalted
with
Baron
Nashor
buff
is
only
granted
to
those
team
members
who
are
currently
alive.
Dead
team
members
will
NOT
respawn
with
the
buff.
Furthermore,
this
buff
is
the
only
buff
in
Summoner's
Rift
that
does
not
transfer
via
kills.
If
a
champion
is
killed
with
this
buff,
the
buff
is
destroyed
and
cannot
be
taken
again
until
Baron
Nashor
respawns.

Trivia
During
the
2010
Snowdown
Showdown
,
Baron
Nashor
wore
three
santa
hats,
one
for
each
of
his
three
faces.
Also,
during
the
2012
Snowdown
Showdown
,
players
can
each
earn
a
Summoner
Icon
featuring
Baron
Nashor's
main
head
with
a
santa
hat
on.
His
name
is
a
tribute
to
Roshan,
(his
name
being
an
anagram
of
Roshan)
a
monster
filling
a
similar
role
in
Defense
of
the
Ancients
.
A
box
labeled
"Baron
Acid"
can
be
seen
in
the
preview
video
for
the
launch
of
the
League
of
Legends'
Mac
Version.
CEO
and
Co-Founder,
Brandon
'Ryze'
Beck
has
stated
on
Twitter
that
they
are
currently
planning
to
give
Baron
Nashor
a
visual
upgrade,
with
his
latest
concept
revealed
in
the
second
League
of
Legends
cinematic,
A
Twist
of
Fate
.
[3]
In
the
death
recap
screen,
Voracious
Corrosion
is
labeled
as
"WormAttack"
and
Wrath
of
the
Ancients
"wrathdamage".
The
icon
for
the
Baron
buff
is
the
same
as
the
icon
for
Kassadin's
Null
Sphere.
