Combat
Points
Riot
Points
(formerly
known
as
combat
points
earlier
in
the
European
server)
are
one
of
the
two
in-game
currencies.
They
can
be
purchased
with
real
money
and
are
used
to
purchase
in-game
things
to
add
convenience,
extra
customization
options,
or
diversity
to
the
experience.
Examples
of
things
that
can
be
purchased
with
Riot
Points
are
champions
,
alternate
champion
skins
,
or
boosts
,
which
are
modifiers
that
increase
the
rate
at
which
you
gain
Influence
Points
or
Summoner
Experience
Points
.
Apart
from
purchasing
champions
and
extra
rune
pages,
which
are
both
also
purchasable
with
Influence
Points,
Riot
Points
cannot
be
used
to
directly
affect
gameplay.

Although
many
people
claim
that
Legendary
Skins
cost
$20,
this
table
shows
that
their
actual
cost
is
$14,
not
considering
any
bonus
points
gained
by
purchasing
larger
bundles
of
Riot
Points.
Some
online
payment
methods
will
grant
you
more
points
for
your
money
than
others.
Purchasing
points
with
a
mobile
phone
for
example,
yields
less
net
income
of
points,
as
opposed
to
using
PayPal
for
the
transaction.
Champions'
Prices
Main
article:
List
of
champions
Buying
all
the
champions
if
they
are
on
sale
will
cost
43,262
Riot
Points,
a
little
less
than
$300
USD.
