Strategy
As
Vampiric
Scepter
a
necessary
component
for
almost
all
of
the
life
steal
items
(the
only
exception
is
Guinsoo's
Rageblade
),
Vampiric
Scepter
is
useful
for
any
stage
of
the
game.
Vampiric
Scepter
increases
the
sustain
of
any
champion,
but
it
is
best
used
with
auto-attacking
champions
as
lifesteal
only
works
with
basic
attacks.
Ranged
champions,
such
as
Ashe
or
Tristana
,
are
able
to
restore
health
while
being
relatively
safe.
Melee
champions,
such
as
Jax
or
Wukong
,
are
in
more
danger
to
be
damaged
if
an
enemy
champion
is
nearby.
Vampiric
Scepter
is
often
used
with
Doran's
Blade
,
allowing
champions
to
stay
in
lanes
for
extended
periods
of
time
without
needing
to
go
back
to
base
to
heal.
Doran's
Blade
is
often
the
preferred
item
as
it
also
adds
health,
but
its
drawbacks
are
not
building
into
other
items
and
the
health
restored
by
its
passive
effect
does
not
scale
well
as
the
game
progresses.
