A
stealth
ward
placed
in
the
river.
Stealth
wards
have
green
tops
as
opposed
to
vision
wards,
which
have
pink
tops.
A
stealth
Ward
is
a
consumable
item
in
League
of
Legends
.
[1]
Only
3
of
these
wards
can
be
carried
in
a
summoner's
inventory
and
only
3
can
placed
on
the
map
per
player.
Ghost
Ward
Ghost
Wards
,
placed
by
the
Sightstone
and
Ruby
Sightstone
,
are
functionally
identical
to
Stealth
Wards
,
but
are
colored
white
instead
of
green.
The
difference
is
only
visible
while
using
the
classic
ward
skins.
Both
Sightstone
items
share
the
same
counter
for
the
number
of
active
wards.
If
you
place
a
ward
after
you
already
have
three
out,
the
first
one
you
placed
is
removed
and
a
new
ward
is
placed
in
the
position
indicated.
Notes
Wards
placed
into
walls
will
jump
to
the
nearest
placeable
location,
as
shown
in
this
video
.
Teleporting
to
the
ward
will
reveal
it
for
the
duration
of
the
spell.
Stealth
wards
are
unavailable
for
the
Twisted
Treeline
,
the
Crystal
Scar
,
and
the
Howling
Abyss
maps.
The
ward
has
a
cast
range
of
600.
After
being
placed,
it
is
visible
for
1
second,
and
then
becomes
invisible
until
its
3-minute
duration
expires.
The
ward
has
3
HP,
and
every
attack
will
only
damage
it
by
1.
There
is
also
no
way
to
regenerate
its
health
.
While
some
abilities,
such
as
Evelynn's
Hate
Spike
,
become
active
around
and
can
target
wards,
they
cannot
actually
damage
wards
without
the
ward
being
revealed
by
a
Vision
Ward
or
a
champion
with
a
Sweeping
Lens
.
Wards
grant
30
gold
when
destroyed
(including
Ghost
Wards
from
the
sightstone
items).
If
the
player
who
reveals
the
ward
and
the
killer
of
the
ward
are
different
players,
the
gold
will
be
split
50/50
so
each
gains
15
gold.
The
ward
from
Wriggle's
Lantern
grants
20
gold.
If
the
player
who
reveals
the
ward
and
the
killer
of
the
ward
are
different
players,
the
gold
will
be
split
50/50
so
each
gains
10
gold.
Strategy
Intelligent
usage
of
wards
goes
a
long
way,
namely
in
key
brush
locations,
like
intersections,
in
front
of
Dragon
and
Baron
Nashor
.
This
is
useful
for
map
awareness
of
potential
ganks,
champion
movements,
and/or
attempts
to
kill
an
Epic
Monster.
The
lone
shrub
in
front
of
both
Epic
Monsters
is
an
excellent
place
to
both
reveal
the
river
and
keep
tabs
over
their
presence.
Wards
that
are
placed
on
a
Noxious
Trap
will
cause
the
mushroom
to
explode,
a
damage
free
method
of
removing
them.
Certain
characters
with
attack-timer
refreshing
abilities
can
clear
wards
in
the
moments
after
they
are
placed.
Shyvana
can
use
Twin
Bite
along
with
an
autoattack.
Renekton
can
autoattack
followed
by
Ruthless
Predator
,
or
use
a
Fury-enhanced
cast
of
Ruthless
Predator
by
itself.
Leona
can
attack,
activate
and
use
Shield
of
Daybreak
,
and
immediately
attack
again.
However
the
third
attack
is
not
automatic
and
must
be
ordered
by
the
player.
Katarina
can
attack,
use
Shunpo
(which
briefly
reveals
wards
whether
allied
or
enemy),
and
attack
again.
Rengar
can
attack,
use
Savagery
and
then
follow
up
with
another
autoattack
or
Empowered
Savagery
.
Jayce
can
use
Hyper
Charge
while
in
Cannon
form
to
gain
maximum
attack
speed
for
3
attacks
without
the
need
to
reset
the
attack
timer.
Lee
Sin's
Safeguard
,
Jax's
Leap
Strike
,
and
Katarina's
Shunpo
can
be
used
to
dash
to
allied
wards.
This
can
be
used
to
move
over
walls,
chase
enemies,
or
escape.
