Lore
A
Field
of
Justice
As
a
direct
response
to
the
world's
growing
physical
and
political
instability,
Valoran's
key
magicians
–
including
many
powerful
summoners
–
came
to
the
conclusion
that
conflicts
needed
to
be
resolved
in
a
controllable
and
systemic
way.
They
formed
an
organization
called
the
League
of
Legends
,
whose
purpose
was
to
oversee
the
orderly
resolution
of
political
conflict
in
Valoran.
Housed
in
the
Institute
of
War
,
the
League
would
be
given
the
authority
by
Valoran's
political
entities
to
govern
the
outcomes
of
the
organized
conflict
they
would
administer.
The
League
resolved
that
all
major
political
conflict
would
be
settled
through
the
use
of
specially
prepared
arenas
strategically
located
throughout
Valoran.
Summoners
representing
a
particular
political
allegiance
would
each
call
forth
a
champion
;
the
champions,
leading
mindless
minions
generated
by
novice
summoners
manipulating
a
Nexus
,
would
fight
to
achieve
the
objective
of
the
arena
they
were
in.
The
most
common
victory
condition
of
a
battle
arena
would
be
to
destroy
the
opposing
faction’s
Nexus
.
These
arenas
are
collectively
referred
to
as
"The
Fields
of
Justice".
The
fights
in
the
various
Fields
of
Justice
over
which
the
League
presides
are
not
only
of
great
political
interest
to
Valoran,
but
also
of
great
social
interest.
The
League
magically
transmits
the
sights
and
sounds
of
the
action
as
it
unfolds
to
specially
built
arcane
receivers
located
in
key
settlements
throughout
Valoran.
Watching
a
fight
in
a
Field
of
Justice
is
one
of
the
more
popular
entertainment
activities
Valoran's
denizens
engage
in.
The
Fields
The
Crystal
Scar
-
The
Crystal
Scar
was
once
known
as
the
mining
village
of
Kalamanda,
until
open
war
between
Demacia
and
Noxus
broke
out
over
control
of
its
vast
underground
riches.
Settle
your
disputes
on
this
Field
of
Justice
by
working
with
your
allies
to
seize
capture
points
and
declare
dominion
over
your
enemies!
The
Howling
Abyss
-
The
Howling
Abyss
is
a
bottomless
crevasse
located
in
the
coldest,
cruelest,
part
of
the
Freljord.
Legends
say
that,
long
ago,
a
great
battle
took
place
here
on
the
narrow
bridge
spanning
the
chasm.
No
one
remembers
who
fought
here,
or
why,
but
it
is
said
that
if
you
listen
carefully
to
the
wind
you
can
still
hear
the
cries
of
the
vanquished
tossed
howling
into
the
Abyss.
Summoner's
Rift
-
The
oldest
and
most
venerated
Field
of
Justice
is
known
as
The
Summoner’s
Rift.
This
battleground
is
known
for
the
constant
conflicts
fought
between
two
opposing
groups
of
Summoners.
Traverse
down
one
of
three
different
paths
in
order
to
attack
your
enemy
at
their
weakest
point.
Work
with
your
allies
to
siege
the
enemy
base
and
destroy
their
Nexus!
The
Twisted
Treeline
-
Deep
in
the
Shadow
Isles
lies
a
ruined
city
shattered
by
magical
disaster.
Those
who
venture
inside
the
ruins
and
wander
through
the
Twisted
Treeline
seldom
return,
but
those
who
do
tell
tales
of
horrific
creatures
and
the
vengeful
dead.
