Efficiency
Malady
was
gold
efficient
even
without
its
magic
resist
shred
and
on-hit
damage.

Nashor's
Tooth
Notes
Malady's
magic
resistance
shred
was
able
to
bring
an
enemy's
magic
resistance
below
zero.
The
very
first
auto
attack
did
not
get
the
benefit
of
the
magic
resistance
reduction.
Any
magic
damage
from
the
auto
attack
was
calculated
first,
and
the
debuff
was
applied
after.
This
means
the
full
benefit
of
the
reduction
was
seen
on
the
8th
hit
after
all
7
stacks
had
been
applied.
Malady
was
beneficial
on
champions
that
rely
on
attack
speed
and
on-hit
effects.
Warwick
is
a
great
example
of
such;
his
bonus
magic
damage
and
abilities
that
apply
on-hit
effects
benefit
greatly
from
the
added
magic
reduction
and
magic
damage,
as
well
as
his
basic
attacks
being
supplemented
by
the
AS.
Malady's
passive
was
not
named.
It
was
not
Spellblade,
so
it
stacked
with
Lich
Bane
and
similar
items.
Malady's
own
AP
bonus
granted
extra
2.5
magic
damage
per
auto
attack.
Malady's
on-hit
damage
becomes
as
strong
as
Wit's
End's
at
270
AP.
Trivia
The
Old
Malady,
and
also
the
Oponn's
Razor
Malady
originally
had
a
red
tint
over
a
purple
tint
in
the
icon,
gave
life
steal
,
and
was
built
with
Vampiric
Scepter
instead
of
Amplifying
Tome
.
It
also
did
not
reduce
the
enemy's
magic
resistance,
and
had
the
same
stat
of
a
removed
alpha
item
called
Oponn's
Razor
.
Malady
used
to
be
mentioned
in
Kayle
's
tips
after
its
removal.
