not
have
a

not
you
are
still

The
following
items
grant
Tenacity:
Mercury's
Treads
Moonflair
Spellblade
Spirit
of
the
Ancient
Golem
Zephyr
Notes:
Crowd

stacks
multiplicatively.
Polymorph
is
listed
as
being
reduced
by
Moonflair
Spellblade
and
Zephyr
,
but
not
by
Mercury's
Treads
nor
Spirit
of
the
Ancient
Golem
.
Until
patch
V1.0.0.118
,
Tenacity
was
an
unnamed
effect
unique
to
Mercury's
Treads
.
In
the
aforementioned
patch,
the
effect
was
promoted
into
a
champion
statistic
and
three
additional
items
were
added:
Cloak
and
Dagger
,
Eleisa's
Miracle
and
Moonflair
Spellblade
.
Tenacity
from
multiple
sources
did
not
stack,
similar
to
Enhanced
Movement
.
With
the
Season
Three
item
overhaul
and
the
introduction
of
named
item
effects,
Tenacity
was
reverted
to
an
item
effect.
In
V3.01
,
all
sources
of
crowd
control
reduction
were
changed
to
say
"Tenacity"
and
Tenacity
was
reintroduced
as
a
champion
statistic.
Tenacity
DOES
NOT
reduce
the
strength
of
slows,
only
the
duration.
Until
Season
Three,
Tenacity's
in-game
icon
was
the
same
as
the
icon
used
for
Cho'Gath's
Vorpal
Spikes
and
Baron
Nashor's
passive.
Between
the
introduction
of
season
3
changes
and
V3.01,
it
shared
the
same
icon
as
the
Tenacious
mastery.
As
of
V3.01,
it
no
longer
has
an
icon
in
the
buff
bar.
