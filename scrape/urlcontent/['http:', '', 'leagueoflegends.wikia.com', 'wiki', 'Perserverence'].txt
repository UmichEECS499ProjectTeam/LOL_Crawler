The
subject
of
this
article
was
removed
from
League
of
Legends
in
patch
V1.0.0.152
.
The
information
displayed
is
no
longer
relevant
to
League
of
Legends,
but
exists
here
for
historical
purposes.

Perseverance
was
a
tier
5
utility
mastery
with
3
ranks.
It
was
added
at
the
beginning
of
Season
Two
,
but
soon
replaced
by
the
Strength
of
Spirit
.
Effect
per
rank
Increases
health
and
mana
regeneration
by
3%
(9%
at
rank
3).
Requirements
Requires
16
points
in
Utility.
Strategy
This
mastery
seemed
to
affect
total
and
not
just
base
regeneration,
therefore
it
was
recommended
on
either
very
mana-hungry
characters
or
health-regen
stacking
champions.
