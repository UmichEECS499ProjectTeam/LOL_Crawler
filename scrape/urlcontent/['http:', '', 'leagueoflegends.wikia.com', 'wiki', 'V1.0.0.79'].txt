Important
Keybinding
Change
The
Level
up
spell
hotkey
has
been
changed
to
holding
down
Ctrl
+
pressing
the
spell
hotkey.
It
is
no
longer
Alt.
This
can
be
changed
in
the
keybinding
menu.
Holding
down
Alt
and
pressing
a
spell
hotkey
will
now
cast
the
spell
on
yourself
if
it
is
self-castable,
or
cast
the
spell
under
your
mouse
cursor
if
applicable.
This
is
referred
to
as
"Smart
Casting"
and
can
be
rebound
in
the
key
binding
menu.
New
Framerate
Normalization
Settings
There's
a
new
video
option
available
to
players
called
"Frame
Rate
Cap."
This
allows
players
who
experience
unexpected
drops
in
framerate
to
attempt
to
smooth
out
the
performance.
By
default,
the
option
is
set
to
"Benchmark"
which
means
that
the
framerate
smoothing
is
disabled,
and
the
game
will
run
normally.
The
different
settings
have
the
following
behaviors:
Benchmark
–
this
option
makes
the
game
run
at
its
unaltered
state
with
smoothing
technology
turned
off.
Stable
–
this
attempt
to
detect
and
maintain
a
stable
framerate
above
25
FPS
(frames
per
second).
Players
may
experience
a
slightly
lower
maximum
framerate,
but
fluctuations
should
be
smaller.
High
Framerate
–
this
option
also
detects
the
low
and
high
framerates
and
attempts
to
normalize
the
performance,
but
at
a
higher
rate
than
the
"Stable"
option.
25/30/60/80
–
this
option
allows
the
player
to
control
the
target
framerate
the
smoothing
process
will
attempt
to
achieve.
Note:
These
modes
are
still
being
tweaked
and
evaluated
as
we
attempt
to
improve
the
framerate
of
the
game.
Different
settings
may
produce
different
results
for
different
CPU,
video
card
and
driver
configurations.
PVP.net
v1.07.13
Improved
the
profanity
filter
in
PVP.net
as
well
as
added
an
in-game
filter.
Both
of
these
use
whole
word
filtering
instead
of
partial
word
filtering.
There
is
now
a
shared
option
in
PVP.net
that
will
enable
/
disable
the
filter
for
both
PVP.net
and
the
game.
Optimized
matchmaking
slightly
to
reduce
queue
times
and
prevent
issues
for
users
exiting
the
queue
under
certain
conditions.
Fixed
an
issue
where
it
was
possible
to
be
left
behind
when
an
arranged
team
joins
the
queue.
Fixed
an
issue
with
Logout
that
was
keeping
chat
logged
in,
causing
you
to
still
appear
online
to
friends.
Fixed
an
issue
that
was
causing
some
games
to
go
to
the
"Skip
Waiting
for
Stats"
screen
when
someone
would
leave
after
the
countdown
timer
hit
zero.
Fixed
a
few
issues
where
the
Leaver
Buster's
queue
dodging
messaging
was
being
displayed
incorrectly.
Fixed
an
issue
that
was
occasionally
causing
a
delay
when
fulfilling
purchases
from
the
store
to
an
inventory.
Fixed
an
issue
that
was
causing
presence
inaccuracies
for
friends
in
an
Arranged
Team.
Fixed
an
issue
where
some
friends
would
show
up
as
offline,
but
were
still
able
to
chat.
Fixed
an
issue
that
would
cause
remaining
team
members
to
not
be
able
to
requeue,
if
one
member
of
the
team
had
just
queue
dodged.
Fixed
an
issue
where
logging
out
and
back
in
with
a
different
account
would
cause
invites
to
come
from
the
first
account.
Fixed
an
issue
where
the
"Cancel"
button
wasn't
always
removing
players
from
the
queue.
Fixed
an
issue
that
was
causing
tooltips
to
be
truncated
when
the
Friends
List
was
undocked
from
PVP.net.
Fixed
an
issue
where
if
you
had
chat
rooms
on
auto-join,
you
sometimes
would
not
see
all
of
your
friends
online
when
first
logging
in.
Fixed
an
issue
where
the
doors
in
the
arranged
team
lobby
sometimes
would
not
open.
Fixed
an
issue
where
if
you
logged
out
or
exited
PVP.net
while
in
queue,
it
would
not
always
correctly
remove
you
from
the
queue.
