Trivia
Master
Yi
was
designed
by
Ezreal
.
Yi
(易)
means
"easiness",
"change"
or
"divination"
in
Chinese.
His
name
in
the
Chinese
servers
is
written
as
易
大师
in
Simplified
Chinese,
and
易
大師
in
Traditional
Chinese/Japanese.
Pronounced
in
Chinese
would
be
Yì
Dàshī,
while
in
on'yomi,
it
would
be
I
Daishi
("e"
"die-she").
[1]
Master
Yi's
name
is
a
pun
on
the
word
"mastery".
"Wuju"
is
a
reference
to
two
of
the
developers
at
Riot
Games
.
Namely,
Andy
Woo
and
Jeff
Jew.
"Wuju",
or
"Wuji/Mukyoku"
(無極
lit.
Extremeless),
is
the
grey
field
a
taijitsu
(the
yin-yang
symbol)
is
traditionally
shown
on,
symbolizing
"nothingness".
It
also
nods
to
an
old
sword
style
honed
for
art
in
current
times.
In
the
Chinese
servers,
it
is
written
as
"Wuji/Mukyou"
(无极),
which
means
the
same
thing.
[1]
In
the
Chinese
servers,
his
Wuju
Style's
name
in
Simplified
Chinese
is
written
as
无极剑道
and
in
Traditional
Chinese/Japanese
as
无极剣道.
Pronounced
in
Chinese
is
Wújí
Jiàndào
and
in
Japanese
is
Mukyou
Kendou,
which
both
literally
mean
"Extremeless
Sword
Path";
with
"kendo"
being
a
traditional
Japanese
term
for
swordsmanship
and
fencing
sports
in
Japan,
hinting
that
Wuju
is
a
traditional
sword
style,
despite
the
fact
that
his
pupil
Wukong
uses
a
staff
for
the
art.
[1]
It
bears
similarity
to
"Wushu",
the
collective
name
of
Chinese
martial
arts,
mostly
known
as
Kung-fu
in
western
countries.
Master
Yi
was
one
of
the
champions
chosen
for
the
Ionian
pool
available
during
the
Ionia
vs.
Noxus
match
.
However,
he
was
not
one
of
the
selected
champions.
The
goggles
Master
Yi
wears
(known
as
the
Seven
Lenses
of
Insight)
seem
to
be
an
over-exaggeration
of
trifocals
goggles
with
night
vision,
and
according
to
his
background,
provide
a
similar
effect,
allowing
him
to
"see
across
a
wider
range
of
the
spectrum".
His
goggles
can
also
be
seen
in
the
preview
video
for
the
Mac
version
of
League
of
Legends.
In
addition,
his
sword
can
also
be
seen
in
a
later
part
of
the
video.
His
costume
and
the
goggles
bring
strong
resemble
to
Sam
Fisher
from
Splinter
Cell
game
franchise.
His
new
joke
in
his
rework
"The
goggles?
Just
for
reading!"
references
the
fact
that
his
goggles
provide
no
actual
effect
in
his
gameplay.
One
of
Yi's
new
taunts
"I
will
take
an
eye....as
if
I
don't
have
enough
already."
also
jokes
around
with
the
amount
of
lenses
his
goggles
have.
A
fan
joke
video
give
birth
to
a
popular
troll
build
called
Dunkmaster
Yi,
focusing
on
going
really
fast
via
building
duplicates
of
the
Zeal
item
with
a
Wriggle's
Lantern
,
and
the
catchphrase
"get
dunked!".
Master
Yi
(sharing
with
Pantheon
)
is
the
Champion
with
the
highest
Base
Movement
Speed
in
the
game,
being
355.
Master
Yi's
sword
resembles
a
katana,
but
is
more
of
a
dao
(a
curved
Chinese
blade
that
predates
the
katana's
creation).
In
terms
of
some
of
Yi's
artworks
(and
his
initial
visual
model)
and
his
visual
model
update,
he
appears
to
be
left-handed
and/or
ambidextrous.
Master
Yi's
joke
"The
key
to
immortality?
Not
dying."
hints
to
his
beta
lore
noting
at
his
real
age;
which
he
is
implied
to
be
over
1000
years
old
despite
physically
being
no
more
than
30.
It
is
unknown
if
this
is
still
the
case
with
his
current
lore.
His
age's
implication,
as
well
as
his
ultimate,
Highlander
,
are
possible
references
to
the
film
Highlander
,
where
many
of
the
characters
are
immortal
and
are
easily
hundreds
of
years
old.
The
mechanics
of
his
ultimate
also
nod
to
"the
quickening"
effect.
In
Highlander,
if
an
immortal
killed
another
immortal
through
decapitation,
they
would
gain
their
knowledge
after
an
electrical
and
mostly
violent
surge.
Similarly,
upon
a
kill
or
an
assist,
Yi's
cooldowns
are
refreshed
as
an
explosion
effect
of
energy/ki
emanates
off
of
him
(in
a
manner
similar
to
fireworks),
though
it
is
shown
as
a
small
flash
emanating
from
his
body
ever
since
his
rework.
Also
to
nod
to
the
immortals
of
Highlander
is
the
Chinese
name
of
his
ultimate,
which
is
Gāoyuán
Xiětǒng
(高原血统
in
Simplified
Chinese,
高原血統
in
Traditional
Chinese).
In
Japanese
the
name
is
pronounced
as
Kougen
Kettou,
both
translations
literally
meaning
"Plateau
Lineage".
[1]
Skins
Assassin
Master
Yi
,
Golden
Alistar
and
White
Mage
Veigar
are
the
only
skins
priced
at
390
,
making
them
the
cheapest
skins,
excluding
sale
prices
and
free/promotional
skins.
It
was
also
initially
in
previous
versions
a
mere
black
re-color
of
his
default
skin,
though
it
can
be
implied
that
the
dark
tone
of
the
skin
is
meant
for
covert
blending,
hence
the
name
of
the
skin.
The
reworked
of
this
skin
instead
features
a
more
ninja-like
theme,
such
as
a
face
mask,
a
hoodie,
a
more
katana-like
sword
via
the
design
of
its
hilt,
and
two
kunai
in
the
place
of
Yi's
swordboots.
His
normal
skin
along
with
his
said
Assassin
skin
has
two
swordboots
with
one
on
each
armored
leg,
though
they
have
very
little
if
not
no
use
at
all.
His
movement
animations
shows
such
a
thing
weighs
down
his
running,
but
he
may
have
adjusted
to
this
via
the
skins
without
the
armored
legs.
As
of
his
rework,
in
all
his
skins,
Master
Yi
runs
in
a
more
normal
fashion.
Chosen
Master
Yi
is
a
direct
reference
to
the
Jedi
Knights
of
the
Star
Wars
franchise.
After
his
visual
upgrade
in
2013,
Chosen
Master
Yi
'
s
lightsaber
causes
a
humming
sound
when
attacking.
This
skin's
lightsaber
changes
colors
based
upon
Wuju
Style's
current
state:
blue
(normal),
green
(passive),
red
(active).
This
is
similar
to
the
Jedi
Knight
games
which
had
blue,
yellow,
and
red
lightsaber
stances;
each
altered
the
speed
and
power
of
attacks.
Ionia
Master
Yi
is
probably
Master
Yi's
outfit
while
he
is
at
his
usual
home,
Ionia
,
or
the
outfit
he
wears
in
some
special
occasions
much
like
Blood
Moon
Akali
or
Blood
Moon
Shen
.
His
red
color
scheme
bears
resemblance
to
Sun
Jian
and
the
Kingdom
of
Wu
from
the
Romance
of
the
Three
Kingdoms,
in
the
Dynasty
Warriors
adaptions;
the
tree
in
the
background
also
bears
a
slight
nod
to
Jian
Ye,
the
main
captial
of
Wu
(via
its
playable
stage
version
in
Dynasty
Warriors
4/Shin
Sangokumusou
3).
Headhunter
Master
Yi's
clothing
bears
many
resemblances
with
the
Predator
species
from
the
Predator
and
Alien
vs
Predator
franchises.
The
skin's
helmet
and
goggles
also
look
very
similar
to
the
game
Shinobi's
main
character
Hotsuma
,
who
would
dash
to
his
enemy
similar
to
Master
Yi's
Alpha
Strike
.
In
his
Chinese
artwork,
there
is
the
shadowy
form
of
Cho'Gath
behind
him,
who
vaguely
resembles
the
Aliens
.
His
sword
pre-work
also
longer
than
the
dao
in
his
other
skins,
though
with
no
effect
on
his
auto
attack
range.
The
blade
is
also
flipped
to
the
other
side
in
his
idle
stance,
thus
causing
Yi
during
his
dance,
laugh
and
death
to
hold
it
with
blade
flipped
the
other
way
with
his
right
hand
(all
other
skins
barring
Chosen
would
show
the
opposite).
This
was
notably
fixed
in
his
rework
with
the
blade
being
a
more
proper
size
in
relevance
to
Yi's
other
skins,
and
having
it
being
held
properly.
Relations
Master
Yi's
goggles
were
made
and
given
to
him
by
Heimerdinger
.
Master
Yi's
entire
kinfolk
were
killed
with
chemical
inventions
created
by
Singed
.
Master
Yi
seeks
the
end
of
Noxus'
predations.
Master
Yi
often
spends
his
time
meditating
and
training
near
the
Great
Barrier,
south
of
the
Institute
of
War
.
Master
Yi
tutored
Wukong
in
the
art
of
Wuju.
They
seem
to
share
similar
quotes.
