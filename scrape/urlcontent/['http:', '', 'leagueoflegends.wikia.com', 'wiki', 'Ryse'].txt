Ability
Details
Desperate
Power
is
a

area
of
effect
around
their
targets.

effects

an
area

Desperate
Power
has
no
cast
time
and

applies
spell
effects
as
a
single
target
ability.
The
bonus
damage
is
not
dealt
to
the
primary
target
of
a
spell.
If
Desperate
Power
is
cast
while
the
projectile
of
Overload
or
Spell
Flux
is
in
flight,
the
ability
will
still
gain
the
increased
spell
vamp
and
bonus
area
of
effect
damage
upon
reaching
its
target.
