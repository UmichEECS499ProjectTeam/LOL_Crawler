a
brief
instance
of
sight

he
will
throw
it
the

distance
units

direction
of
cast.
If

is
a
self-targeted
buff
.
Additional
Information:
Vicious
Strikes
will
increase
all
healing
effects
targeted
at
Olaf.
This
will
stack
additively
with
Spirit
Visage
.
However,
it
is
worth
noting
that
Spirit
Visage
will
not
increase
healing
effects
sourced
from
other
champions
(such
as
an
allied
Astral
Blessing
),
while
Vicious
Strikes
will
.

health
Active:
Olaf
attacks
with
such
force
that
it
deals
true
damage
to
his
target.
The
ability's
cost
is
equal
to
30%
of
the
damage
dealt
and
the
cost
is
refunded
if
Reckless
Swing
kills
the
target.
Olaf's
basic
attacks
will
reduce
the
cooldown
of
Reckless
Swing
by
1
second.

Ability
Details
Reckless
Swing
is
a
single
target
ability.
Applies
spell
effects
as
a
single
target
ability.
Spell
vamp
is
fully
applied.
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
will
apply
a
35%
slow.
True
damage
ignores
all
forms
of
damage
reduction,
except
invulnerability
.
Spell
shields
will
block
the
ability
(Olaf
will
still
pay
the
cost).
Additional
Information:
Unlike
Olaf's
other
abilities,
Reckless
Swing
costs
health.
He
is
one
of
a
select
few
champions
that
utilize
multiple
cost
types.
As
with
all
activated
health-cost
abilities,
Reckless
Swing
can
be
cast
at
any
health
value
but
will
not
reduce
Olaf's
health
below
1.
This
makes
Reckless
Swing
effectively
free-to-cast
at
1
health.
Health
cost
refund
on
the
ability
is
considered
a
heal,
therefore
it
is
affected
by
increased
healing
from
Olaf's
Vicious
Strikes
and
Spirit
Visage
.
Kayle's
Intervention
will
not
mitigate
Reckless
Swing's
cost.
Reckless
Swing
will
cancel
if
Olaf
loses
sight
of
his
target
during
the
cast
time,
as
with
many
of
the
game's
older
and
non-updated
champions.

Olaf
instantly
removes
all
crowd
control
effects
from
himself
and
becomes
immune
to
them
for
6
seconds.
During
this
time,
he
loses
the
passive
bonus
but
gains
bonus
attack
damage.

Ability
Details
Ragnarok
is
a
self-targeted
ability
that
also
passively
grants
a
defensive
buff
.
Additional
Information:
Ragnarok
can
be
cast
while
under
the
effects
of
any
form
of
crowd
control
.
It
is
worth
noting
that—while
it
can
be
activated—Ragnorak
will
not
remove
airborne
crowd
control
effects.
However,
it
will
ignore
them
once
active.
Ragnarok
will
not
prevent
the
application
of
the
Sejuani's
"Frost"
debuff,
as
it
not
a
crowd
control
effect
prior
to
being
detonated
by
Permafrost
.
As
of
V3.13
,
all
attack
speed
reduction
is
treated
as
a
slow
and
will
also
be
ignored.
Abilities
with
conditional
effects
are
usually
composed
of
multiple
debuffs,
and
ignoring
the
crowd
control
debuff
will
not
ignore
the
conditional
effects.
To
name
a
few:
Olaf
will
still
have
his
attack
damage
reduced
by
Mocking
Shout
and
Chomp
.
