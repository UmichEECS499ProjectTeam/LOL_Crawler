Lore
Bilgewater,
over
the
years,
has
become
a
vital
stop
for
trade
ships
traveling
near
the
Blue
Flame
Island.
While
this
increased
the
nation's
wealth
and
influence
over
Valoran,
it
has
also
made
the
city-state
a
major
refuge
for
piracy,
and
the
island
itself
a
tempting
target
for
pirate
raids.
Rum
is
the
city's
major
export,
which
is
made
in
the
various
pubs
and
taverns
down
the
Fleet
Street.
Before
sailing
into
the
port,
onlookers
can
see
the
image
of
a
white
skull
on
the
large
rock
behind
the
city.
Culture
The
native
inhabitants
of
Bilgewater
are
rugged
seafaring
folk
and
many,
naturally,
are
also
pirates.
While
the
League
can
usually
keep
vessels
that
remain
within
protected
waters
safe,
they
have
little
jurisdiction
over
what
occurs
in
the
open
seas.
Sailors
intrepid
enough
to
venture
out
there
are
free
to
decide
their
own
fate
and
fortune.
Many
Bilgewater
pirates
also
sail
to
other
nations
and
are
known
for
their
raids
on
settlements.
The
port-city
is
the
home
to
League
Champion
Gangplank,
the
Saltwater
Scourge
.
He
arose
to
represent
his
nation,
though
his
true
motives,
as
he
is
a
pirate,
are
questionable.
Gangplank
and
Miss
Fortune,
the
Bounty
Hunter
,
often
bicker
over
their
city-state's
future
direction.
Both
are
striving
to
unite
the
people
of
Bilgewater
in
order
to
turn
them
into
a
strong
and
independent
society.
Bilgewater
is
a
relatively
lawless
city-state,
particularly
in
the
pirate-run
slums.
The
majority
of
the
city's
denizens
carry
a
variety
of
weapons,
which
range
from
cutlasses
to
pistols,
in
order
to
protect
themselves
at
all
times.
Traditionally,
the
Bilgewater
warriors
coat
their
weapons
with
the
remains
of
their
drinks
the
night
before
a
battle
or
raid.
This
has
the
effect
of
increasing
the
pain
of
wounds
caused
and
often
spreads
diseases
such
as
gangrene,
inhibiting
their
enemies'
ability
to
fight
back.
Many
of
their
larger
ironclad
ships
are
also
outfitted
with
multiple
cannons
that
can
strike
targets
over
long
distances.
Relations
with
Bandle
City
Ties
between
Bandle
City
and
Bilgewater
have
always
been
a
little
tense,
mainly
due
to
the
occasional
pirate
assaults
on
yordle
vessels.
Relations
with
Ionia
During
Noxus'
hostilities
on
Ionian
soil,
many
pirates
from
Bilgewater
sailed
to
the
island
nation.
For
years
they
ruthlessly
pillaged
the
settlements
along
the
island's
coastlines
and
fought
naval
battles
with
Ionian
vessels
when
engaged.
Even
after
the
war,
many
Ionians
still
feel
deep
enmity
towards
Bilgewater
due
to
their
denizens'
actions.
Relations
with
Noxus
While
the
two
nations
have
no
true
alliance,
Bilgewater
and
Noxus
are
on
relatively
beneficial
terms
with
one
another.
Bilgewatian
pirates
on
occasion
will
assist
the
Noxian
military,
should
they
see
the
endeavor
profitable.
Though
the
League
eventually
put
a
stop
to
Noxus'
military
campaigns,
Katarina,
the
Sinister
Blade
,
is
a
mainstay
down
at
Bilgewater's
Fleet
Street.
She
can
often
be
seen
poking
her
head
into
the
pubs
and
taverns
in
search
of
sailors
down
on
their
luck,
offering
an
even
share
of
the
plunder
to
those
willing
to
sail
under
her
command.
Bilgewater
Days
On
September
19th,
129
years
before
the
League,
the
port
city
of
Bilgewater
was
officially
founded,
creating
a
haven
and
destination
to
pirates
and
seafarers
everywhere.
What
started
off
as
a
one-day
celebration
of
Bilgewater's
origin
became
a
weekend,
and
due
to
the
raucous
nature
of
the
town's
inhabitants,
celebration
spread
through
the
entire
month.
September
has
come
to
embody
sailors
enjoying
the
end
of
the
temperate
season,
drinking
the
last
of
the
summer
ales
and
participating
in
unruly
games
to
prove
their
worth
as
the
fiercest
pirate
in
Valoran.
[1]
A
sampling
of
the
festivities
include:
Lady
Luck
A
continuous
gambling
tournament
where
skill
is
just
as
highly
prized
as
being
quickest
to
draw
the
knife
in
your
boot.
A
vast
assortment
of
games
and
competitions
await,
with
gold
Valors
passing
hands
after
every
blackjack
and
snake
eyes
on
the
table.
Lady
Luck
can
be
a
fickle
mistress,
easily
swayed
by
a
card
up
your
sleeve
and
the
words
"all
or
nothin'".
Drink
The
Water!
An
indisputable
challenge,
a
pirate
orders
the
Bilgewater
Special,
which
is
a
foul,
unidentifiable
mix
of
liquor
from
behind
the
bar,
with
each
pirate
mixing
in
a
bit
of
whatever
they
can
find
around
the
table
or
in
their
pockets.
The
brave
one
to
drink
it
all
gets
a
pat
on
the
back,
all
the
Valors
that
can
fit
into
the
empty
mug,
and
an
evening's
worth
of
indigestion.
The
Ruckus
Armed
only
with
a
wooden
club
or
an
abandoned
peg
leg,
pirates
leap
aboard
a
ship
in
a
King
Of
The
Hill
competition
to
see
who
can
stay
atop
the
Crow's
Nest
longest,
and
is
crowned
the
Captain
of
The
Ruckus
for
the
year.
Beard
protection
is
accepted,
but
shoes
are
prohibited.
Brands
of
Rum
The
relative
peace
the
League
has
kept
over
Valoran
has
led
to
an
increase
in
trade
and
the
desire
for
worldly
imports.
The
demand
for
Bilgewater's
famous
rums
is
especially
high.
Captain
Morgan
Rackham
gives
a
few
samples:
Rapture
Rum
If
you've
got
a
bit
of
jink
to
spare
and
don't
mind
paying
for
a
bit
of
celebrity,
you
can
head
on
over
to
Fortune's
Favor
on
Fleet
Street
for
a
bit
of
Miss
Fortune's
private
stock.
Rapture
is
clear
as
diamonds,
with
a
pleasantly
clean
aroma
of
cut
cane.
To
shake
things
up,
Miss
Fortune
adds
a
hint
of
pepper
and
hot
cinnamon
to
keep
you
warm
on
deck
during
stormy
days
at
sea.
To
be
enjoyed
with
your
favorite
tropical
fruit,
Miss
Fortune's
Rapture
Rum
is
every
bit
as
much
the
exotic
beauty
that
she
is!
Gangplank's
Black
Pearl
Rum
Let
me
ask
you
a
question,
sailor.
Have
you
ever
chewed
rum?
No?!
Well
then
you've
probably
never
run
afoul
of
Gangplank
and
his
fabled
Black
Pearl.
Aged
in
charred
oak
casks
and
infused
with
some
of
the
richest
spices
that
Valoran
has
to
offer,
this
rum
comes
out
blacker
than
pitch
and
about
as
thick.
Gangplank's
Black
Pearl
is
a
draught
for
the
true
rum
enthusiast,
only.
The
rest
of
you
blokes
are
just
going
to
wind
up
feeling
barmy
and
running
for
the
deck
rails.
So
be
careful!
I've
seen
a
bit
of
the
black
stuff
lay
out
even
the
roughest
blighter
with
nary
a
hint
of
warning.
Myron's
Dark
Rum
This
rum
is
the
trademark
drink
of
Myron's
Murderhole,
one
of
the
most
famous
and
historic
bars
in
all
of
Bilgewater.
Dark
in
color
with
the
aroma
of
woody
molasses,
this
infamous
spirit
is
a
veritable
staple
of
Bilgewater
sailors
on
the
high
seas.
Richer
than
its
lighter
relatives,
this
dark
beauty
finishes
with
an
uncanny
sweetness
that's
just
perfect
for
taking
the
edge
off.
Enjoy
with
hot
water,
or
even
straight
from
the
bottle.
Either
way,
Myron's
Dark
will
keep
you
warmer
than
a
pea
coat
on
a
blustery
day.
Mount
Atin
Eclipse
Rum
This
rum
is
characteristically
served
at
Plankwalkin'
Pete's,
a
newfangled
bar
run
dockside
by
a
barmy
lad
with
a
peg
leg.
Light
amber
in
color,
Mount
Atin
will
assail
your
senses
with
the
aroma
of
sweet
grass,
molasses,
nutmeg,
and
just
a
hint
of
citrus.
A
bit
dry
on
its
own,
your
typical
dose
comes
served
with
tonic
and
a
lime,
so
after
a
glass
or
two
you're
well
on
your
way
to
warding
off
both
scurvy
and
malaria.
History
Piracy
Strikes
Bandle
City
Merchants
The
pirate
Tiresias
Ellington
and
his
crew
boarded
a
Bandle
City
ship
and
sacked
the
vessel
of
its
cargo.
This
particular
shipment
was
on
its
way
to
a
celebration,
a
commemoration
to
Poppy,
the
Iron
Ambassador
,
and
her
appointment
to
service
as
envoy
between
Demacia
and
the
yordles
.
Bandle
City
appealed
to
the
League
to
solicit
reparations
from
Bilgewater
for
the
loss
of
the
goods,
along
with
spoiling
their
anniversary
plans.
Bilgewater's
stance
was
that
they
were
not
responsible
for
the
actions
of
a
few
independent
sailors.
GrugMug
Grog
Slog
The
famed
Bilgewater
GrugMug
Grog
Slog
was
a
yearly
competition
amongst
privateers
looking
to
prove
their
mettle
as
the
hardest
drinkers
on
the
high
seas.
Both
grog-drinkers
and
grog-crafters
alike
convened
at
the
GrugMug
Tavern
to
crown
the
year's
best
"Scab"
and
"Glug".
The
Scab
was
awarded
to
the
creator
of
the
strongest,
most
corrosive
grog,
and
the
Glug
was
awarded
to
the
hearty
soul
that
can
drink
the
most
of
it
before
requesting
medical
attention.
Historically,
Gangplank
had
won
the
Scab
title
for
15
years,
ever
since
he
joined
his
father
on
his
ship,
the
Dead
Pool.
The
most
recent
GrugMug
Grog
Slog
event
concluded
after
an
exhausting
6
hour
final
between
Gangplank
and
Sarah
Fortune.
In
the
end,
Scab
title
was
awarded
to
Miss
Fortune
in
an
unexpected
upset
after
several
tense
stages
of
caustic
tests
and
analysis.
The
panel
of
judges
declared
her
the
winner
when
her
concoction
melted
completely
through
the
pewter
mug,
table,
and
the
floor.
Gangplank's
recipe
stopped
just
short
of
eating
through
the
floor,
instead
pooling
in
a
steamy
puddle
upon
the
resin-coated
floorboards.
[2]
Attack
of
the
Sea
Fizz,
the
Tidal
Trickster
After
wandering
the
ocean
for
many
years
the
fish-like
creature
known
as
Fizz
discovered
the
port
of
Bilgewater.
He
was
fascinated
with
the
existence
of
life
above
the
water
and
could
not
resist
exploring
the
island.
In
his
endless
curiosity,
Fizz
inadvertently
meddled
in
the
affairs
of
the
humans
who
lived
there,
and
his
presence
did
not
go
unnoticed.
His
mischief
angered
many
residents
who
eventually
sought
to
capture
or
kill
him.
Fizz
found
himself
cornered,
and
he
prepared
to
return
to
the
sea
despite
the
fondness
he'd
come
to
hold
for
Bilgewater.
As
he
stood
at
the
docks,
a
massive
dragon-shark
attacked
the
port.
Fizz
defeated
the
beast,
using
his
resourcefulness
and
knowledge
of
the
creature's
weaknesses
to
his
advantage.
Having
earned
the
gratitude
and
respect
of
the
humans,
Fizz
decided
to
stay
in
Bilgewater.
The
Titan
of
the
Depths
Nautilus,
the
Titan
of
the
Depths
A
gigantic
man
in
an
iron
diver
suit
appeared
upon
the
shores
of
Bilgewater.
Referring
to
himself
as
Nautilus
,
he
searched
for
the
men
who
had
condemned
him
to
die
in
the
sea
depths.
Terrified
sailors
who’d
heard
his
tale
directed
Nautilus
back
to
the
Institute,
but
the
summoners
refused
to
relinquish
the
names
of
the
other
men
from
his
expedition.
By
then
Nautilus
had
learned
about
the
League
of
Legends
and
there
he
saw
an
opportunity
to
discover
and
punish
those
responsible
for
the
time
and
life
he
lost.
