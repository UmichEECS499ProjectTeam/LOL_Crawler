Example
Smite
is
a
targeted
summoner
spell
that
deals
true
damage
to
a
monster
or
enemy
minion
.
It
is
available
on
Summoner's
Rift
,
the
Twisted
Treeline
,
and
the
Crystal
Scar
.
Strategy
Smite
is
generally
used
for
jungling
.
Aside
from
decreasing
a
jungler's
clear
time,
its
high
damage
provides
a
strategic
last-hit
advantage
at
high-priority
buffs
like
Dragon
and
Baron
Nashor
.
Smite
can
also
be
used
to
push
a
lane
more
quickly.
When
doing
so,
it's
generally
best
to
save
Smite
for
cannon
minions
.
Smite
deals
true
damage,
so
it
will
always
deal
the
stated
amount;
it
cannot
be
reduced
or
amplified
in
any
way.
Smite
deals
damage
to
pets,
such
as
Tibbers
and
Malzahar's
Voidlings
.
Smite
damages
bloblets
from
Zac's
Cell
Division
,
so
it
can
be
used
to
finish
him
off.
This
is
the
only
occasion
where
Smite
can
kill
a
champion.
Smite
procs
spell
vamp,
so
it
is
a
good
strategy
for
junglers
like
Lee
Sin
to
use
their
spell
vamp-granting
abilities
(
Lee
Sin's
Iron
Will
)
before
casting
Smite
.
Smite
heals
Hecarim
while
his
Spirit
of
Dread
is
activated.
