Lore
The
Rune
Wars
Until
only
twenty
years
ago,
Runeterra
was
on
a
collision
course
with
disaster.
As
quickly
as
Runeterra’s
denizens
would
band
together
in
ancient
times
as
tribes,
opposing
tribes
would
war
to
settle
their
disputes.
No
matter
the
era,
the
preferred
choice
of
warfare
has
always
been
magical.
Armies
would
be
enhanced
or
decimated
by
spell
and
rune
alike.
Champions
made
the
most
of
magical
items
forged
for
them
as
they
led
or
supported
armies.
Summoners
–
often
the
de
facto
leaders
of
Valoran’s
political
forces
–
would
unleash
mighty
magical
powers
directly
against
foes
and
their
holdings
with
little
regard
for
consequence.
With
such
an
abundance
of
raw
magical
power
at
their
disposal,
there
was
little
motivation
for
summoners
to
explore
more
environmentally-friendly
forms
of
warfare.
Within
the
last
two
hundred
years,
however,
the
dangers
of
unchecked
magical
warfare
began
to
expose
the
fragility
of
Runeterra
to
everyone
residing
in
Valoran
.
The
last
two
Rune
Wars
drastically
altered
the
geophysical
landscape
of
Valoran,
even
after
magical
energy
was
focused
on
restoring
it.
Violent
earthquakes
and
horrific
magically-fueled
storms
made
life
on
Valoran
challenging,
even
before
factoring
in
the
horror
of
warfare
on
the
populace.
It
was
theorized
that
another
unchecked
Rune
War
would
tear
the
world
asunder.
The
League
of
Legends
As
a
direct
response
to
the
world’s
growing
physical
and
political
instability,
Valoran’s
key
magicians
–
including
many
powerful
summoners
–
came
to
the
conclusion
that
conflicts
needed
to
be
resolved
in
a
controllable
and
systematic
way.
They
formed
an
organization
called
the
League
of
Legends,
whose
purpose
was
to
oversee
the
orderly
resolution
of
political
conflict
in
Valoran.
Housed
in
the
Institute
of
War,
the
League
would
be
given
the
authority
by
Valoran’s
political
entities
to
govern
the
outcomes
of
the
organized
conflict
they
would
administer.
The
League
resolved
that
all
major
political
conflict
would
be
settled
through
the
use
of
specially
prepared
arenas
strategically
located
throughout
Valoran.
Summoners
representing
a
particular
political
allegiance
would
each
call
forth
a
champion;
the
champions,
leading
mindless
minions
generated
by
novice
summoners
manipulating
a
nexus,
would
fight
to
achieve
the
objective
of
the
arena
they
were
in.
The
most
common
victory
condition
of
a
battle
arena
would
be
to
destroy
the
opposing
faction’s
nexus
.
These
arenas
are
collectively
referred
to
as
the
Fields
of
Justice
.
While
all
major
political
conflicts
were
being
funneled
through
the
League
of
Legends,
physical
conflicts
between
warring
political
entities
were
not
completely
eliminated.
For
example
–
the
strategic
choice
of
the
League
to
build
the
Institute
of
War
directly
between
the
constantly
warring
city-states
of
Demacia
and
Noxus
stopped
almost
all
direct
confrontation
between
them,
though
military
skirmishes
continue
to
break
out.
Instead,
the
warlike
Noxian
High
Command
has
turned
its
ambitions
of
conquest
offshore.
Even
still,
all
political
entities
abide
by
the
governance
of
the
League
of
Legends.
No
wise
regent
would
be
foolish
enough
to
rail
against
a
vast
cabal
of
immensely
powerful
magicians,
summoners,
and
champions.
The
fights
in
the
various
Fields
of
Justice
over
which
the
League
presides
are
not
only
of
great
political
interest
to
Valoran,
but
also
of
great
social
interest.
The
League
magically
transmits
the
sights
and
sounds
of
the
action
as
it
unfolds
to
specially
built
arcane
receivers
located
in
key
settlements
throughout
Valoran.
Watching
a
fight
in
a
Field
of
Justice
is
one
of
the
more
popular
entertainment
activities
Valoran’s
denizens
engage
in.
Structure
The
League
of
Legends
is
supervised
by
a
council
of
three
powerful
summoners,
known
as
the
High
Council
of
Equity.
Each
summoner
has
been
on
the
Council
of
Equity
since
the
inception
of
the
League
of
Legends
except
for
its
newest
High
Councilor,
Heywan
Relivash;
High
Councilor
Relivash's
ascension
took
place
five
years
ago
after
the
mysterious
disappearance
of
the
previous
High
Councilor,
Reginald
Ashram.
However,
after
a
scandal
involving
High
Councilor
Heywan
Relivash,
he
has
been
stripped
of
his
position,
was
imprisoned,
and
has
been
replaced
by
Vessaria
Kolminye.
The
Council
of
Equity
is
responsible
not
only
for
the
leadership
and
guidance
of
the
League,
but
also
to
act
as
the
highest
court
of
appeal
for
adjudication
of
Valoran's
political
entities.
The
structure
of
the
League
is
focused
around
internal
organizations
that
lead
their
various
goals.
Each
city-state
is
assigned
an
Emissary
of
the
League
,
a
diplomat
who
serves
as
an
on-location
political
representative
to
enact
the
will
of
the
League.
The
Adjudicators
are
the
arbiters
assigned
to
a
given
match
in
the
Fields
of
Justice.
The
Council
is
the
body
of
high-ranking
summoners
which
rules
over
political
outcomes
once
a
battle
arena
match
has
been
resolved.
City-States
The
League
of
Legends
recognizes
settlements
with
substantial
influence
on
Valoran
as
city-states.
These
nations
are
afforded
a
great
deal
of
rights
and
protections
within
the
League,
such
as
being
allotted
one
League
Assembly
chair.
The
chosen
emissaries
are
entitled
to
reside
at
the
Institute
of
War
and
cast
votes
in
League
Assemblies
on
their
city-state's
behalf.
They
may
also
appeal
to
the
League
for
general
arbitration
of
political
affairs.
Any
settlement
can
apply
for
membership
in
the
League
and
ascend
to
city-state
status.
However,
they
must
fulfill
certain
League
requirements:
the
settlement's
population
must
be
of
sufficient
size,
it
must
have
a
defined
governmental
structure,
and
it
must
have
a
means
to
police
itself.
There
are
currently
eight
city-states
recognized
by
the
League:
