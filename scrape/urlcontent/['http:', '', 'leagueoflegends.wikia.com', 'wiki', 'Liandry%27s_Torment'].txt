Strategy
Liandry's
Torment
is
probably
best
for
ability
power
champions
that
either
can
deal
percent
health
magic
damage
like
Amumu
,
Brand
,
Elise
,
Evelynn
,
Fizz
,
Poppy
,
Malzahar
Mordekaiser
or
Sejuani
or
have
damage
over
time
abilities
like
Amumu
,
Brand
,
Cassiopeia
,
Dr.
Mundo
,
Fiddlesticks
,
Gangplank
,
Malzahar
,
Rumble
,
Singed
,
Swain
or
Teemo
.
This
item
has
synergy
with
items
with
crowd
control
effects,
like
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
or
Iceborn
Gauntlet
,
because
the
item
will
apply
the
slow
debuff
and
Liandry's
Torment
which
will
deal
double
damage.
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
will
slow
champions
on-spell-hit
but
the
slow
only
lasts
1.
5
seconds
while
the
DoT
occurs
over
3
seconds,
so
only
first
half
of
DoT
will
be
doubled.
Deathfire
Grasp
deals
percent
magic
damage
based
on
maximum
health,
while
Liandry's
Torment
deals
percent
magic
damage
based
on
current
health,
which
might
intuitively
seem
to
not
synergize
well
together.
However,
because
Deathfire
Grasp
's
damage
is
reduced
by
the
enemy's
magic
resist,
its
15%
damage
amplification
will
still
result
in
an
overall
increase
to
Liandry's
Torment
's
damage.
Liandry's
Torment
will
only
have
its
maximum
damage
contribution
mitigated
if
Deathfire
Grasp
's
active
is
used
when
the
opponent's
current
%
health
is
below
100%
-
%
damage
reduction
from
resists
and
other
factors.
For
example,
if
an
opponent
has
an
effective
40%
magic
damage
reduction,
it
is
efficient
to
use
Deathfire
Grasp
's
active
while
the
opponent's
current
health
is
above
60%
(100%
-
40%
=
60%).
Ultimately,
because
Liandry's
Torment
is
based
on
current
health,
its
contribution
becomes
smaller
as
the
opponent
loses
health;
therefore,
using
Deathfire
Grasp
's
active
on
an
opponent
with
a
%
current
health
lower
than
this
rule
still
generally
results
in
a
very
small
loss
in
efficiency.
In
practical
application,
any
potential
anti-synergy
between
the
two
items
can
be
disregarded
as
negligible.
Notes
Spell
damage
is
not
specific
about
damage
type,
both
physical
and
magic
damage
spells
work.
Most
abilities
which
apply
On-hit
effects
such
as
Infinite
Duress
and
Toxic
Shot
will
not
trigger
Liandry's
Torment
.
Also
excluded
are
items
with
on-hit
effects
such
as
Wit's
End
and
Nashor's
Tooth
.
There
is
a
selection
of
abilities
that
apply
on-hit
effects
that
are
still
classified
as
spells
and
will
trigger
Liandry's
Torment
.
These
abilities
are
generally
area
of
effect
and
will
trigger
spell
vamp
.
For
example,
Righteous
Fury
and
Vorpal
Spikes
.
Certain
damage
dealing
item
actives
will
also
work,
such
as
Bilgewater
Cutlass
,
Hextech
Gunblade
and
Deathfire
Grasp
.
This
item's
passive
will
not
work
with
item
passives
which
deal
magic
damage
such
as
Thornmail
,
Sunfire
Cape
and
itself.
(tested

Mechanic
Liandry's
Torment
ticks
will
tick
6
times
at
half
second
intervals.
Each
tick
does
1%
of
enemy
current
health
as
magic
damage.
Damage
from
each
tick
is
calculated
individually.
This
effect
checks
on
every
tick
if
the
enemy
movement
is
impaired
and
will
deal
double
the
magic
damage
(2%)
if
true.
Trivia
The
item
was
referred
to
as
Liandry's
Lament
in
several
Riot
posts,
and
is
occasionally
referred
to
as
such.
The
item
was
originally
going
to
be
called
Zephyr's
Lament,
but
was
later
changed
to
Liandry's
Torment.
If
a
player
checks
the
"death
recap"
after
dying,
if
they
were
dealt
damage
by
Liandry's
Torment,
the
damage
from
this
item
has
no
icon
and
is
refered
as
"zephyrslamentburn"
The
item
was
named
after
LiaNdrY
,
the
leader
of
unofficial
Russian
client
development
team.
