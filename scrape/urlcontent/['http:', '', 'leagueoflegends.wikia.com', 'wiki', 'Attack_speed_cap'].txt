Attack
speed
(often
shortened
as
AS
or
ASPD
)
is
the
frequency
at
which
a
champion
performs
basic
attacks
and
are
displayed
as
"attacks
per
second".
Attack
speed
caps
at
2.
5
attacks
per
second,
or
1
attack
every
two
fifths
of
a
second
(0.
4
seconds).
Attack
speed
bonuses
works
by
adding
a
percentage
of
a
champion's
base
attack
speed
to
his
or
her
"base
attack
speed."
Champions
with
a
low
base
attack
speed
will
receive
less
of
an
attack
speed
boost
from
the
bonus
than
champions
with
a
high
base
attack
speed,
but
the
proportional
increase
in
DPS
will
remain
the
same
for
both.
One's
attack
speed
can
be
increased
via
leveling
up,
items
,
runes
,
masteries
,
buffs
,
and
abilities
.
One's
attack
speed
can
only
be
decreased
by
items
,
abilities,
and
the
Dragon
.

Calculations
Base
attack
speed
Every
champion's
base
attack
speed
(
AS
base
)
is
calculated
using
a
hidden
variable
called
attack
speed
offset,
which
ranges
from
−0.
10
to
0.
08
[1]
.
(
AS
base
)
is
the
total
number
shown
at
level
1
without
runes,
masteries,
etc.
It
is
represented
this
way
throughout
the
wiki.
$${\it
AS}_{\rm
base}
=
{1
\over
1.6
*
(1
+
{\it
attack\
speed\
offset})}$$
$${\it
AS}
=
{1
\over
1.6
*
(1
+
{\it
attack\
speed\
offset})}*
\Bigl(1
+
{\it
AS}_{\rm
bonuses}
+
{{\it
AS}_{\rm
per\
lvl}*({\it
level}-1)
\over
100}\Bigr)$$
Bonus
attack
speed
sources
Champions
gain
AS%
at
each
level,
not
including
level
1.
This
amount
ranges
from
roughly
0%
to
4%
and
depends
on
the
champion.
Items
Champion
abilities
The

The
Frenzy

Attack
Speed

Bonus
AS%
stacks
additively
.
Example:
Stinger
grants
+40%
attack
speed
and
Nashor's
Tooth
grants
+50%
attack
speed,
so
the
champion
gains
+90%
in
total.
Notes:
Final
attack
speed
cannot
go
above
the
cap
of
2.
5
attacks
per
second.
Many
in-game
tooltip
percentages
(such
as
runes)
have
been
rounded,
so
results
may
be
slightly
different
unless
the
precise
numbers
are
known.
Example
Calculating
base
attack
speed:
Twisted
Fate's
attack
delay
is
−0.04.
\({1
\over
1.6
*
(1
-
0.04)}
=
{1
\over
1.6
*
0.96}
=
0.651041\overline6\).
This
is
Twisted
Fate's
base
attack
speed,
seen
at
level
1
(without
runes,
masteries,
etc).
The
number
seen
in
game
is
rounded
to
3
decimal
places:
0.651.
Calculating
"bonus
attack
speed":
Every
time
Twisted
Fate
levels
up,
he
gains
3.
22\
%
as
bonus
AS%.
At
level
18
he
has
gained
\(3.22\%
\times
17
=
54.74\%\)
as
bonus
AS%.
At
18
he
has
maxed
Stacked
Deck
increasing
his
attack
speed
by
30%.
Let's
say
he
has
the
Fury
mastery
up
to
5%.
Let's
also
say
he
has
Phantom
Dancer
:
+50%.
All
together
he
has:
\(54.74\%
+
30\%
+
5\%
+
50\%
=
139.74\%\)
bonus
AS%
or
1.
3974
bonus
AS
as
a
decimal.
Final
calculation:
\(\begin{align}
&
{1
\over
1.6
*
0.96}\times
239.74\%
\\
=&
0.651041\overline6
\times
239.74\%
\\
\approx
&
1.56081
\end{align}\)
In
game,
the
number
will
be
shown
as:
1.561.

Notes
All
percentages
listed
in
a
champion
's
attack
speed
statistic
are
approximations.
Attack
speed
reduction
duration
is
not
affected
by
crowd
control
reduction
.
However
if
attack
speed
reduction
is
in
one
ability
with
crowd
control
like
Nunu's
Ice
Blast
,
then
the
crowd
control
reduction
reduces
its
duration.
So
attack
speed
reduction
is
reduced
by
the
effect
only
along
with
other
crowd
control.
This
has
been
changed
with
Patch
3.13,
as
Attack
Speed
Reductions
are
now
counted
as
Slows.
