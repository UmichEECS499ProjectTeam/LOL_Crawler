Trivia
Viktor
was
designed
by
Hephastopheles
.
[1]
Viktor's
robotic
hand
can
be
seen
in
the
video
for
the
Mac
Version
of
League
of
Legends.
Viktor
is
voiced
by
Owen
Thomas
,
who
also
voices
Twisted
Fate
.
Viktor
was
the
last
champion
released
in
2011.
Viktor's
character
concept
shares
similarities
with
the
Deus
Ex
series,
as
the
theme
of
the
series
deals
with
Transhumanism
and
the
use
of
human
enhancement
technologies
.
Viktor
bears
some
similarities
to
the
villain
Victor
von
Doom
from
Marvel
comics
.
Viktor
also
shares
similarities
with
the
tech-priests
,
from
the
Warhammer
40,000
franchise,
in
ideology
and
appearance.
Viktor's
dance
is
a
reference
to
the
Melbourne
Shuffle
,
a
dance
originating
from
Australia.
A
side-by-side
comparison
can
be
seen
here
.
The
codename
"Hexmage"
used
internally
by
Riot
refers
to
Viktor.
[2]
Quotes
Viktor
shares
a
quote
with
Jayce
:
"Pave
the
way."
Skins
Full
Machine
Viktor
bears
some
resemblance
to
the
Cybermen
from
the
Dr
Who
series.
Both
share
similar
goals,
as
the
Cybermen
seek
to
make
all
beings
the
same
as
them,
cold
and
without
emotions.
It
also
bears
resemblance
to
the
Toa
Nuva
,
from
the
Bionicle
franchise.
Prototype
Viktor
bears
some
resemblance
to
The
Doctor
from
the
G.I.
Joe:
The
Rise
of
Cobra
movie.
Creator
Viktor
depicts
him
as
the
maker
and
leader
of
the
Battlecast
line.
The
splash
art
features
Battlecast
Prime
Cho'Gath
and
Battlecast
Urgot
.
In
addition,
a
floating
figure
with
a
glowing
eye
is
visible
in
the
skin's
background.
This
was
later
revealed
to
be
Battlecast
Vel'Koz
.
[3]
There
are
also
several
hints
at
future
Battlecast
skins;
Battlecast
Skarner
'
s
face
can
be
seen
below
Cho'Gath's,
with
his
stinger
just
above
his
body.
Battlecast
Kog'Maw
can
be
seen
behind
Urgot.
It
should
also
be
noted,
however,
that
the
jaw
displayed
on
the
supposed
Battlecast
Skarner
appears
more
like
Omen,
the
cancelled
champion.
Relations
Viktor
led
the
team
that
constructed
Blitzcrank
,
the
first
steam
automaton
which
obtained
sentience.
Unfortunately
Viktor's
triumph
was
usurped
by
Professor
Stanwick,
who
stole
credit
for
Blitzcrank's
creation.
Viktor's
research
was
later
used
to
reconstruct
and
revive
Urgot
.
Viktor
views
Jayce
,
the
charismatic
inventor
from
Piltover
,
as
an
obstacle
to
his
"glorious
evolution".
One
that
he
must
overcome.
Viktor
defeated
Jayce
and
stole
a
powerful
arcane
crystal
to
power
his
creations.
Jayce
later
created
the
Mercury
Hammer
and
counter
assaulted
Viktor's
laboratory,
destroying
Viktor's
prototype
weapons.
Viktor
is
the
leader
of
the
Evolution
,
seeking
to
replace
organic
life
with
machine-augmented
bodies.
The
Battlecast
line
of
skins
show
the
results
of
his
victory,
warping
the
League's
champions
to
suit
his
vision.
