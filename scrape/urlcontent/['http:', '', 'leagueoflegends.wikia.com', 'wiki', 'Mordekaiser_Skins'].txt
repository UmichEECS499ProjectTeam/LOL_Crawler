Trivia
Mordekaiser
was
designed
by
Coronach
.
Mordekaiser
is
one
of
five
champions
voiced
by
Adam
Harrington,
the
other
four
being
Karthus
,
Ryze
,
Kassadin
,
and
Shaco
.
Morderkaiser
is
possibly
inspired
by
the
Four
Horsemen
of
the
Apocalypse
,
particularly
the
rider
symbolizing
Conquest.
Or,
given
his
strong
connections
to
sickness
and
malady,
Pestilence.
(The
other
horsemen
theme
champions
to
have
been
realesed
so
far
are
Karthus
,
Thresh
and
Hecarim
.)
Mordekaiser
is
the
only
champion
in
the
League
of
Legends
to
not
having
any
crowd
control
and
mobility
that
can
help
him
escape
in
one
kit.
Every
one
of
Mordekaiser's
abilities
is
in
reference
to
a
heavy
metal
song:
Children
of
the
Grave
/
Iron
Man
are
both
songs
by
Black
Sabbath
.
The
buff
to
the
prisoner
from
Children
of
the
Grave
used
to
be
called
The
Prisoner
,
an
Iron
Maiden
song;
however,
now,
it
is
simply
called
"Children
of
the
Grave
buff."
Mace
of
Spades
refers
to
the
song
Ace
of
Spades
,
by
Motörhead
from
the
eponymous
album,
Ace
of
Spades.
Mace
of
Spades
is
translated
to
"Morgenstern"
in
the
German
and
french
versions
of
the
game.
"Morgenstern"
is
in
German
the
name
of
the
weapon
he
uses.
Morgenstern
is
also
a
song
by
Rammstein
.
Translated
back
to
English,
Morgenstern
means
"
morning
star
",
a
category
of
spiked,
medieval
mace-like
weapons.
Siphon
of
Destruction
refers
to
the
song
Symphony
of
Destruction
,
by
Megadeth
.
Creeping
Death
is
a
song
by
Metallica
from
the
album
Ride
the
Lightning
.
Creeping
Death
is
translated
to
"Metallische
Luft"
in
the
German
version
of
the
game,
which
translates
back
to
Metallic
Air
,
also
a
reference
to
Metallica.
Mordekaiser
is
one
of
the
five
champions
who
use
health
as
a
primary
resource
for
casting
spells.
The
other
four
champions
are
Aatrox
,
Dr.
Mundo
,
Vladimir
and
Zac
.
Mordekaiser's
name
is
derived
from
the
online
identity
of
Yun
"Stich"
Lam,
the
girlfriend
of
a
Riot
designer,
Colt
'Ezreal'
Hallam
.
[1]
"Mordekaiser"
means
"Murder
Emperor"
when
translated
from
German.
Currently
Children
of
the
Grave
applies
the
longest
damage
over
time
debuff
in
the
game.
The
meme
of
"Mordekaiser
es
#1,
huehuehue"
originates
from
a
NA
League
of
Legends
user
who
made
the
"Brasil
5v5
tier
list"
.
This
was
later
popularized
by
McRoosterDota's
video
The
the
Mac
Debut
Video,
there
is
a
child's
drawing
of
Mordekaiser
standing
next
to
a
burning
house
with
"I
♥
My
Daddy"
written
at
the
top.
His
mace
can
also
be
seen
alongside
Caitlyn's
rifle.
Quotes
Mordekaiser's
quotes
are
also
metal
references.
"Misery
loves
company"
is
a
song
of
that
name
by
Anthrax
,
as
well
as
Bon
Jovi
and
Nirvana
.
He
also
shares
this
quote
with
Evelynn
and
the
western
altar
.
It
also
is
a
line
in
Metallica's
My
Friend
of
Misery
and
Home
of
the
Blues
by
Johnny
Cash.
His
quote
,
"No
pain,
no
drain!"
is
a
direct
reference
to
his
own
mechanic
,
as
he
will
not
"drain"
any
shield
for
Iron
Man
if
he
doesn't
hit
anything
(the
"pain")
It's
also
a
reference
to
the
song
"No
pain,
no
Gain"
,
by
the
German
metal
band
Scorpions
Mordekaiser
breaks
the
fourth
wall
on
occasion,
saying
"You
only
need
to
click
once,
fool!"
when
he
is
ordered
to
move.
"So
be
it...
Summoner."
Is
a
direct
reference
to
Return
of
the
Jedi
from
the
Star
Wars
saga
when
the
Emperor
says
to
Luke
Skywalker:
"So
be
it...
Jedi."
Mordekaiser's
quote,
"Time
to
shred"
is
a
reference
to
Shredding,
a
type
of
guitar
play
:
consists
of
performing
a
very
fast
and
hard
melody
solo
,
which
is
particularly
common
in
Heavy
Metal.
Mordekaiser
shares
the
same
quote
with
Evelynn
:
"If
I
must."
Mordekaiser
shares
a
quote
with
Renekton
:
"Carnage!"
Mordekaiser's
quote
"For
great...torment!"
is
similar
to
Heimerdinger
's
quote
"For
great
science!".
Skins
Mordekaiser
shares
a
Pentakill
skin
theme
with
Karthus
,
Sona
,
Yorick
and
Olaf
.
Dragon
Knight
from
Dota
2
shares
a
similar
color
scheme
with
Dragon
Knight
Mordekaiser.
Lord
Mordekaiser
originally
had
a
spike
on
its
belt,
which
was
removed
for
suggestiveness.
This
could
still
be
seen
during
the
loading
screen
for
a
couple
patches,
but
has
since
been
corrected.
The
skin
in
question
may
have
been
a
reference
to
William
Murderface's
codpiece
from
the
television
show
Metalocalypse.
Lord
Mordekaiser
skin
resembles
Lord
Sauron
from
Lord
of
the
Rings
franchise.
To
be
specific,
it
also
resembles
the
other
Dark
Lord
from
Tolkien
works,
Melkor/Morgoth
from
The
Silmarillion,
Sauron's
master
and
the
first
Dark
Lord.
It
also
resembles
the
first
Overlord
from
the
Overlord
videogame
franchise.
It
also
resembles
the
Chaos
Space
Marines
in
Warhammer
40000
Universe
(the
Chinese
image
is
very
similar
to
Dawn
of
War
2:
Chaos
Rising
cover).
Relations
Mordekaiser
originally
came
from
the
Shadow
Isles
but
is
currently
stalking
the
slums
of
Noxus
.
Mordekaiser
is
in
the
metal
band
Pentakill
with
Karthus
,
Olaf
,
Sona
and
Yorick
.
According
to
the
Journal,
the
band
is
said
to
be
successful
across
Valoran
.
The
altars
on
the
Twisted
Treeline
suggest
:
"I
serve
you,
because
I
must,
Mordekaiser.
"-Western
Altar,
"
I
serve
you
gladly,
Mordekaiser
."
-Eastern
altar
,
Mordekaiser
had(s)
some
high
rank
in
the
Shadow
Isles,
fortunately
evidenced
by
his
old
lore
which
said
that
he
was
an
undead
general.
"
Mordekaiser
is
not
to
be
trusted,
Hecarim!"
-Western
Altar,
taking
in
count
that
Hecarim
fights
for
the
Shadow
Isles,
Mordekaiser
actual
goals
aren't
linked
to
the
Isles,
but
to
his
personal
benefits.
"Are
you
also
a
prisoner
Mordekaiser"
-Western
altar,
likely
means
that
Mordekaiser
affiliation
to
the
Shadow
Isles
is
forced,
and
he
fights
this
by
following
his
personal
objectives,
not
of
the
Isles.
Apart
from
the
altars,
this
quote
(from
his
old
lore)
"
The
common
perception
is
that
the
encompassing
armor
protects
him,
I
fear
that
–
for
the
fragile
time
being
–
it
actually
protects
us
.
"―
Rozuel
Fecirem
,
somewhat
confirm
the
Western
Altar
quote,
as
his
armor
might
be
his
prison.
Mordekaiser
and
Hecarim
know
each
other,
and
are
stated
to
have
similar
beliefs,
but
disagree
when
it
comes
to
how
they
achieve
their
goals.
