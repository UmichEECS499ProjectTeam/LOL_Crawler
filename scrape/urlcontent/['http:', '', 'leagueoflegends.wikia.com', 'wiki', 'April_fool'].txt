Urf
Urf
Day
commemorates
a
tragic
event
in
the
League
of
Legends
history.
On
that
fateful
day,
April
1st
2010,
a
dear
friend
was
senselessly
taken
before
his
time.
This
friend,
of
course,
was
Urf,
the
Manatee
.
Contents
[

Lore
Despite
the
traditionally
peaceful
ways
of
his
people,
Urf,
the
Manatee,
idolized
the
strength
and
prowess
of
Champions
in
the
League
of
Legends
and
strived
to
become
one.
Of
all
the
League's
Champions,
there
was
none
that
Urf
admired
more
than
Jax,
the
Armsmaster
.
Since
the
introduction
of
the
arena,
no
man
has
forced
the
League
of
Legends
to
revise
their
regulations
more
often
than
Jax,
and
the
self-proclaimed
Grandmaster
at
Arms
rattled
off
a
streak
of
152
consecutive
wins.
In
order
to
compensate
for
the
extreme
power
of
this
Champion,
the
League
created
special
sanctions
for
Jax:
He
is
only
allowed
to
fight
with
weapons
the
League
deems
suitable.
For
now,
that
list
includes
a
lamppost,
a
chicken's
foot,
a
spatula,
a
fishing
rod
and
a
cardboard
tube.
In
his
admiration
and
pursuit
to
become
a
weapons
master
like
Jax,
Urf
has
equipped
himself
with
the
two
great
symbols
of
his
Manatee
heritage
as
his
weapons:
a
fish
(to
symbolize
the
bounty
and
providence
of
the
sea)
and
spatula
(to
pay
homage
to
his
people's
age-long
pursuit
for
culinary
mastery).
Urf
now
begins
his
aquatic
journey
as
the
League's
first
Manatee
Champion,
hoping
one
day
he
will
have
the
opportunity
to
cross
fish
and
spatula
with
chicken's
foot
and
lamppost.
Urf
Day
2010
Happy
Urf
Day,
Everyone!
The
Remains
of
Urf
Unfortunately,
today,
the
story
of
Urf
Day
took
a
tragic
turn,
for
as
Urf
was
swimming
along,
dutifully
guarding
the
river
in
the
Summoner's
Rift
,
he
met
with
a
tragic
demise.
Eye-witness
accounts
have
been
unreliable
at
best,
but
everyone
seems
to
agree
that
just
before
it
happened
a
blue
streak
was
seen
darting
out
of
the
nearby
jungle.
A
great
clamor
ensued,
followed
by
the
doleful
screams
of
a
manatee
done
wrong.
In
the
end,
all
that
was
left
of
this
brave
prince
amongst
sea
cows
was
his
skin...
and
even
that
was
stolen
by
this
most
nefarious
of
perpetrators.
Now
any
good
story
needs
a
moral.
So
if
there's
anything
that
the
story
of
Urf
Day
and
the
story
of
the
Big
Bad
Wolf
have
in
common,
it's
this:
deep
within
every
wolf,
there
is
a
cunning
master
of
disguise
just
waiting
to
get
out.
Take
Warwick
,
for
instance;
a
giant,
bloodthirsty
werewolf
able
to
cunningly
adapt
by
blending
into
even
the
most
innocent
of
surroundings.
He
could
be
anywhere
at
any
time...
behind
a
rock,
in
the
brush,
in
the
jungle,
or
cleverly
masquerading
as
a
lovable,
spatula-wielding
manatee.

Urf
Memorial
Contest
Winners
are
in!
Urf
Day
Proceeds
go
to
Save
the
Manatees!
Announced
by
ByronicHero
:
Well,
summoners,
your
long
wait
is
over.
The
committee
of
Riot
has
met,
and
we
have
rendered
a
decision.
But
before
we
announce
the
results,
there
are
a
few
caveats,
and
I'd
like
to
say
a
few
words
about
Urf.
So,
we
had
originally
announced
our
intention
to
issue
one
winner
of
the
memorial
contest.
Little
did
we
know,
however,
that
in
a
little
more
than
24
hours,
we
would
have
received
over
800
contest
entries,
including
398
poems,
130
pieces
of
artwork,
74
memorial
videos,
20
recorded
songs,
and
150
other
entries,
including
flash
games,
eulogies
and
short
stories.
Over
the
course
of
the
day,
a
record
breaking
number
of
people
visited
the
League
of
Legends
forums
to
pay
their
respects
to
the
passing
of
Urf.
If
he
were
still
with
us,
this
noble
manatee
would
be
truly
moved
by
the
unparalleled
outpouring
of
affection
he
received.
Urf
Proceeds
to
Benefit
Manatee
Conservation
While
we
knew
that
Urf
was
pretty
fantastic,
there
was
no
way
for
us
to
possibly
foresee
the
level
of
community
response
Urf's
death
would
garner.
You
were
moved
by
the
tragedy
of
the
event,
and
so
were
we.
We
were
so
moved,
in
fact,
that
we
wanted
to
guarantee
that
Urf
would
live
on
in
the
hearts
and
minds
of
everyone
as
a
champion
of
all
manatees.
And
so,
to
help
ensure
that
no
sea
cow
shall
have
to
suffer
the
same
fate
as
our
poor,
beloved
Urf,
all
the
proceeds
generated
by
the
sales
of
Urf’s
skin
on
Urf
Day
have
been
donated
to
the
Save
the
Manatee
Club.
And
given
that
over
15,000
Runeterrans
chose
to
celebrate
the
memory
of
this
majestic
marine
mamal
in
style
by
sporting
their
very
own
Urf
suit,
that’s
no
pocket
change!
Even
in
death,
Urf’s
indomitable
spirit
endures
to
help
his
fellow
sea
cows
in
their
hour
of
need!

you’re

the
Manatee

And
the
winners
of
the
Urf
the
Manatee
Memorial
Contest
are…
And
so,
without
further
ado,
allow
me
to
present
the
winners
of
the
Urf
the
Manatee
Memorial
Contest.
Now,
brace
yourselves,
because
there’s
a
lot
more
than
one
of
them.
There
were
so
many
people
whose
efforts
we
wanted
to
recognize
that
we
created
six
different
categories
and
selected
winners
from
each.
These
winners
fall
into
three
reward
tiers.
Grand
prize
winners
will
receive
5,000
Riot
Points
along
with
the
obligatory
“Friend
of
Urf”
forum
title,
Runner
Up
winners
will
receive
2,800
Riot
Points
and,
naturally,
a
“Friend
of
Urf”
forum
title,
and
Honorable
Mentions
will
have
to
content
themselves
with
just
receiving
their
“Friend
of
Urf”
forum
title.
Can
I
get
a
drum
roll,
please?

Lee
Sin's
Urf
Day
Splash
Art
On
March
21st
2011,
Lee
Sin,
the
Blind
Monk
,
was
re-confirmed
on
the
official
League
of
Legends
website
through
a
Champion
Sneak
Peek
.
On
March
22nd,
Riot
Games
released
art
via
their
YouTube
channel
which
includes
Urf,
The
Manatee
.
On
March
24th,
the
"A
new
champion
approaches"
article,
official
screenshots
of
Lee
Sin
can
be
seen.
Interestingly,
in
the
screenshots
the
deceased
champion
Urf,
The
Manatee,
can
be
seen
as
well.
On
March
28th,
Lee
Sin's
Champion
Spotlight
came
out,
but
it
was
an
Urf
Day
related
video,
furthering
the
belief
that
he
wouldn't
actually
be
released.
However,
the
video
stated
that
he
wouldn't
be
released
with
the
V1.0.0.114
patch,
but
rather
on
April
1st
because
he
had
"not
been
buffed
enough".
On
March
31st,
Lee
Sin's
actual
Champion
Spotlight
was
released,
once
again
stating
that
he
would
be
released
on
April
1st.
On
April
1st,
Lee
Sin
was
actually
released
and
became
available
to
buy
in
the
Store.

Urf
Day
2012
Urf
Day
2012
is
Coming!
Announced
by
NeeksNaman
:
Summoners!
Those
of
you
who
are
veteran
members
of
the
League
know
that
April
1st
marks
the
commemoration
of
a
tragic
event
in
League
of
Legends
history.
On
that
fateful
day
in
2010,
a
dear
friend
was
senselessly
taken
from
all
of
us
before
his
time.
I’m
talking,
of
course,
about
Urf
the
Manatee.
The
Sad
Tale
of
Urf
the
Manatee
On
the
very
eve
of
what
would
have
been
his
triumphant
induction
into
the
League
of
Legends
,
this
brave
prince
amongst
sea
cows
met
with
a
most
cruel
fate
at
the
hands
of
a
diabolical
werewolf!
On
his
journey
from
the
sea
Urf
was
ambushed
by
Warwick,
the
Blood
Hunter.
An
epic
struggle
ensued,
but
in
the
end
it
was
wolf
that
triumphed
over
manatee,
carrying
off
his
aquatic
adversary’s
skin
as
a
trophy!
In
the
wake
of
this
most
odious
misdeed,
summoners
of
the
League
banded
together
to
support
one
another
during
this
trying
time.
The
outpouring
of
affection
for
this
brave,
young
manatee
was
tremendous,
and
hundreds
of
summoners
put
their
creative
talent
to
work
memorializing
his
awful
fate
.
The
Urf
Warwick
skin
also
became
one
of
the
best-selling
skins
in
the
League
history,
with
the
proceeds
going
to
benefit
the
Save
the
Manatee
Club
in
memory
of
this
paragon
of
sea
cow
glory.
Now
that
Urf
Day
is
drawing
closer,
we
will
once
again
join
together
in
the
tradition
of
honoring
this
brave,
young
manatee.
Put
your
creative
talents
to
work
memorializing
the
sacrifice
of
Urf,
the
Manatee,
and
you
could
win
an
IP
boost!
For
inspiration,
here
are
some
of
the
most
tearful
tributes
from
the
previous
year
.
Urf’s
Triumphant
Return!
Lost,
but
never
forgotten,
summoners
of
the
League
had
suspected
that
this
might
be
the
end
for
Urf,
the
Manatee,
until
the
end
of
March
2011
–
when
he
teamed
up
with
Corki,
the
Daring
Bombardier,
forming
the
duo
of
Urfrider
Corki!
Through
the
magic
of
GANK
Industries,
Urf
and
Corki
were
able
to
join
forces
and
return
to
the
Fields
of
Justice
much
to
the
delight
of
manatee
enthusiasts
everywhere!
But
with
the
eve
of
Urf
Day
2012
fast
approaching,
all
the
denizens
of
Valoran
have
gathered
together
in
anticipation.
After
his
unexpected
revival
in
2011,
where
could
Urf,
the
Manatee,
be
popping
up
next?
[4]
Pay
Tribute
in
the
Urf
Remembrance
Contest!
Announced
by
Nikasaur
:
Summoners!
As
we
all
know,
Urf
the
Manatee
had
the
heart
of
a
champion.
Unfortunately,
he
had
the
skin
of
a
manatee,
which
some
nefarious
evil-doer
ripped
away
in
the
most
heinous
crime
ever
witnessed
in
the
League
of
Legends.
But
we
do
not
dwell
on
the
abrupt
messiness
of
Urf’s
death;
instead,
we
choose
to
celebrate
the
brilliance
of
his
life…
Celebrate
the
life
of
Urf
the
Manatee
using
video,
photos,
art,
writing
or
any
other
methods
of
expression.
From
March
30th
until
April
2nd
PST,
we’re
hosting
a
contest
celebrating
all
things
Urf.
We’ve
seen
some
incredible
memorials
of
Urf
in
the
past
–
everything
from
baked
goods
to
hoodies
to
cartoons
–
and
we
know
you’ve
got
what
it
takes
to
add
to
that
proud
legacy.
This
must
be
your
own
work!
Don’t
use
anyone
else’s
stuff!
Keep
it
classy,
nothing
inappropriate.
You
can
enter
as
many
times
as
you
like,
but
you
can
only
win
once.
Post
your
submissions
in
the
thread
below,
and
our
Urf
Remembrance
Committee
will
evaluate
all
entries
for
creativity
and
general
appeal.
On
April
2nd,
we’ll
announce
the
winners,
who
will
each
receive
a
10-win
IP
boost
(approximate
value
$5
USD)
and
maybe
even
a
new
surprise
skin!
You
can
find
the
official
rules
here
.
This
Urf
Day,
help
us
remember
the
great
sea
cow
he
was
and
how
much
he
brought
to
all
of
us.
The
League
won’t
be
the
same
without
him…
but
you
can
help
us
ensure
that
he’ll
never
be
forgotten.
