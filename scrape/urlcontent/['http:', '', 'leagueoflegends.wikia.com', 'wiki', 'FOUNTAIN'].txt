The
Nexus
is
the
primary
objective
for
each
map.
In
order
to
win
a
match
a
team
has
to
destroy
the
opposing
team's
Nexus.
The
Blue
team's
Nexus
Contents
[
show
]
Classic
Mode
and
ARAM
In
those
maps,
the
Nexus
is
the
source
of
the
minion
waves
on
the
Twisted
Treeline
,
Howling
Abyss
and
Summoner's
Rift
.
The
Nexus
is
always
protected
by
towers:
one
tower
on
the
Twisted
Treeline,
and
two
on
either
Summoner's
Rift
or
Howling
Abyss.
The
Nexus
turrets
are
untargetable
unless
one
or
more
of
a
team's
inhibitors
are
destroyed,
and
will
remain
vulnerable
until
all
of
the
inhibitors
are
up.
Those
turrets
are
also
able
to
regenerate
health
slowly.
While
the
Nexus
has
no
armor
or
magic
resistance
,
it
does
have
5500
health
and
25
health
regeneration
per
5
seconds.
In
addition
to
being
able
to
regain
health,
the
Nexus
is
not
able
to
be
targeted
until
both
of
its
towers
have
been
destroyed.
In
addition,
you
may
not
target
a
nexus
if
all
three
inhibitors
are
up.
Dominion
Mode
In
Dominion
,
the
Nexus
is
untargetable,
but
its
health
can
be
reduced
under
three
circumstances:
Holding
more
capture
points
than
the
opposing
team.
Slaying
an
enemy
champion
(reduces
the
health
of
the
opposing
team's
nexus
by
a
flat
amount
of
2).
Capturing
a
point,
which
reduces
the
opposing
team's
nexus
by
a
flat
amount
of
how
many
points
the
dominating
team
is
holding
over
the
opposing
team.
An
example
is:
If
X
team
has
3
points
captured
and
Y
team
has
2
points
captured,
then
the
Nexus
for
Y
team
loses
1
(3-2)
health
every
second.
When
a
Nexus
has
100
health
or
less,
it
can
then
only
be
damaged
by
capturing
more
points
than
the
opposing
team.
The
health
of
both
the
allied
and
enemy
Nexuses
is
reported
with
voiceover
when
reduced
to
75%,
50%
and
25%
health.
When
losing
health,
either
side's
nexus
has
what
appears
to
be
a
laser
shooting
into
it.

Trivia
Nocturne,
the
Eternal
Nightmare
,
is
currently
bound
to
a
Nexus
fragment,
trapping
him
in
the
physical
world.
Gragas,
the
Rabble
Rouser
gained
his
massive
size
and
affinity
for
magic
by
drinking
a
brew
endowed
with
the
magic
of
a
Nexus.
Destroying
the
Nexus
awards
50
gold
,
though
this
is
pointless
(as
the
game
ends
after
its
destruction).
In
Dominion
mode,
a
special
track
will
begin
to
play
when
both
of
the
team's
Nexuses
are
at
70
health
or
less.
This
hidden
track
is
similar
to
the
late-game
track,
but
more
'intense'.
Xerath,
the
Magus
Ascendant
requires
the
magic
of
Valoran's
Nexuses
in
order
to
free
himself
of
his
prison.
