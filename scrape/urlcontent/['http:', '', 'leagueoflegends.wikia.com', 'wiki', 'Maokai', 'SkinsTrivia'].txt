Trivia
During
his
Art
Spotlight,
a
tab
for
Jarvan
IV
can
faintly
be
seen
at
the
top.
Later
during
the
Art
Spotlight,
a
tab
is
seen
titled
"blindmonk",
which
refers
to
Lee
Sin
.
Maokai
was
designed
by
Volty
.
Maokai
is
an
anagram
for
"I
Am
Oak".
Maokai
was
named
after
an
artist
at
Riot
whose
real
name
is
Maokai.
[1]
Maokai's
look,
sounds,
and
attitude
can
be
linked
to
the
Ents
in
The
Lord
of
the
Rings
saga.
Maokai
is
the
first
champion
to
be
"born"
on
the
Fields
of
Justice
.
Although
design-wise
there
is
no
clue
that
Maokai
is
an
Oriental
character
like
Xin
Zhao
.
His
name
follows
the
Mandarin
pinyin
scheme
like
Xin
Zhao
(while
Lee
Sin's
name
is
of
different
scheme).
The
official
Chinese
vendor
translates
his
name
as
茂凯
which
literally
means
"lush
(vegetation)-triumphant".
Maokai
was
originally
intended
to
be
just
a
Support/Tank
when
he
was
first
released
however
it
was
realized
that
Maokai
made
a
better
Jungler
with
strong
ganking
capabilities.
The
rune
spiral
that
is
on
Maokais'
ult
is
the
same
rune
that
is
attached
to
Xerath's
chest.
His
/dance
is
a
reference
to
the
Harlem
Globetrotters.
Maokai's
ability
Sapling
Toss
is
a
direct
refrence
to
the
game
Pikmin
from
the
toss
to
the
sapling's
sounds.
Maokai
shares
a
place
with
Poppy
in
having
the
highest
base
armor
of
any
champion
at
level
18
(90
armor).
Skins
Totemic
Maokai
is
based
on
a
totem
,
which
is
an
animal
or
other
natural
figure
that
spiritually
represents
a
group
of
related
people
such
as
a
clan.
Festive
Maokai
was
only
available
during
the
Snowdown
Showdown
of
2011.
Festive
Maokai
is
based
on
the
Christmas
tree
.
In
the
picture
frame
on
Festive
Maokai's
artwork,
the
Snowdown
Showdown
art
for
2011
can
be
seen
Haunted
Maokai
was
only
avaliable
during
the
Harrowing
of
2012.
Haunted
Maokai
resembles
part
of
a
reanimated
Graveyard
.
Haunted
Maokai
and
Zombie
Brand
are
the
first
skins
that
have
animation
on
respawn.
Relations
Maokai
is
a
tree
from
the
Twisted
Treeline
that
has
become
animated.
He
despises
the
existence
that
was
thrust
upon
him
as
he
felt
it
was
a
corruption
of
nature
and
so
fights
as
a
soldier
of
nature.
Maokai
despises
humans
and
their
chaotic
use
of
magic.
Although
Maokai
and
Malphite
have
different
attitudes
regarding
their
being
brought
to
life,
Malphite
stated
that
he
is
"...proud
to
call
the
Twisted
Treant
my
ally",
suggesting
that
these
two
elemental
champions
get
along
quite
well
despite
their
differences.
According
to
League
of
Legends
Beta
site
Maokai
is
rival
with
Zyra
,
probably
because
of
difference
in
their
attitude
towards
humans
and
human
world.
