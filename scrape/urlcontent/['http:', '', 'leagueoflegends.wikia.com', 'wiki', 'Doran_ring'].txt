Background
They
say
Effrem
E.
Doran
was
born
with
a
hammer
in
his
hands
and
a
forge
in
his
heart.
Every
object
he
touched,
he
found
ways
to
improve,
and
he
knew
that
he
was
destined
to
be
a
brilliant
artificer.
At
the
age
of
15,
he
was
invited
to
the
League
with
an
offer
to
assume
the
role
of
Master
Artificer,
a
dream
come
true
and
an
unprecedented
honor
for
one
so
young.
However,
fate
had
other
plans.
En
route,
his
carriage
broke
an
axle.
When
he
leaned
down
to
inspect
it,
he
was
kicked
in
the
head
by
his
donkey,
a
stern
blow.
He
stumbled
back
onto
the
wagon,
but
when
he
arrived
at
the
Institute
of
War
he
was
a
different
boy.
The
kick
had
rendered
his
mind
soft,
but
it
hadn’t
robbed
him
of
his
passion.
He
still
wanted
nothing
other
than
to
craft,
but
where
once
he
may
have
created
singular
masterpieces,
he
now
crafted…somewhat
simpler
items,
and
many
of
them.
He
is
a
kind,
goofy,
good-hearted
soul,
and
he
takes
pride
in
the
work
he
does.
His
items
are
daily
selected
by
champions
on
the
Fields
of
Justice
,
and
he
has
a
permanent
home
at
the
Institute
of
War.
Doran's
Blade
,
Doran's
Shield
and
Doran's
Ring
are
some
of
the
more
famous
crafts.
