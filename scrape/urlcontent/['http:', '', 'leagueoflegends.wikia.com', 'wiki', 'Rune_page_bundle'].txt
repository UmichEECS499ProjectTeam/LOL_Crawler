Runebook
without
Runes
The
Runebook
is
a
tome
in
which
all
of
your
runes
are
kept.
Before
the
battle,
you
can
distribute
your
runes
into
4
sets
from
which
you
can
choose
before
battle
to
best
suit
your
champion
.

Rune
Pages
The
Runebook
is
divided
into
several
sections,
called
rune
pages,
which
contain
all
your
rune
slots.
You
may
distribute
your
runes
across
these
pages
as
you
wish,
but
each
page's
rune-use
is
independent
of
the
other
pages.
This
means
that
you
can
put
a
rune
into
a
slot
on
page
1,
and
then
put
that
very
same
rune
into
a
slot
on
page
2.
With
the
variety
of
runes
available,
this
allows
you
to
create
different
rune
setups
based
on
the
champion
or
build
you
are
using.
For
example,
page
1
could
have
your
bruiser
runes,
and
page
2
could
have
your
caster
runes.
Changing
a
rune
page's
title
You
can
change
the
title
from
the
default
"Page
1"
or
"Page
2"
to
something
like
"Caster"
so
that
you
don't
have
to
look
at
the
stats,
saving
time
for
you
in
Champion
Select.
You
can
do
this
by
clicking
on
the
title,
then
typing
in
what
you
would
like
to
call
the
page.
Slots
Rune
Unlock
Levels
At
first,
your
rune
pages
begin
with
only
one
slot
(a
red
one,
for
Marks
).
As
your
Summoner
gains
levels,
you
unlock
more
and
more
rune
slots
of
all
kinds
(whether
marks
,
seals
,
glyphs
,
or
quintessences
).
A
page
can
hold
a
maximum
of
30
runes
(if
you
have
unlocked
all
the
slots).
This
is
subdivided
into
9
mark
slots,
9
seal
slots,
9
glyph
slots,
and
3
quintessence
slots.
The
order
in
which
you
unlock
slots
is
always
Mark,
Seal,
Glyph.
This
repeats
3
times,
and
then
on
every
10th
level
a
quintessence
slot
is
unlocked
(thus
you
open
quintessences
at
10,
20,
and
30).
Also
on
every
10th
level,
you
gain
access
to
using
a
higher
tier
rune.
At
level
10
you
gain
access
to
the
use
of
Tier
2
runes
and
at
level
20
access
to
use
Tier
3
runes.
Purchasing
pages
Further
Rune
Pages
can
be
purchased
with
IP
in
the
Riot
Store
under
the
"Other"
section.
However,
you
can
only
buy
up
to
18
extra
rune
pages
for
a
total
of
20
rune
pages.
As
such,
you
cannot
purchase
a
7
Rune
Page
Bundle
without
filling
out
a
support
ticket
if
you
already
have
14
or
more
rune
pages.

Rune
Combiner
Here
you
can
sacrifice
runes
for
a
chance
at
a
better
rune!
Sacrifice
2
runes
for
a
rune
of
the
same
Value.
Sacrifice
5
runes
for
a
rune
of
higher
value.
―In-game
instructions
The
Rune
Combiner
can
be
accessed
via
the
♻
(recycling
symbol)
button
in
the
bottom-right
corner
of
the
Runebook.
Only
unused
runes
will
show
up
on
the
list
of
runes
to
combine.
As
there
are
no
tier
4
runes,
only
two
tier
3
runes
can
be
sacrificed.
Runes
of
different
tier
cannot
be
combined.
The
Rune
Combiner
can
produce
runes
of
which
you
already
own
9
(thus
making
the
new
rune
useless
unless
used
for
another
rune
combination)
If
the
10th
rune
doesn't
show
up,
remove
all
of
the
same
runes
from
all
of
your
rune
pages
then
it
will
show
up
in
the
Rune
Combiner.
Certain
runes
do
not
appear
to
be
available
via
the
rune
combiner
(armor
penetration,
magic
penetration,
hybrid
penetration
and
perhaps
others).
As
these
are
some
of
the
most
valuable
of
the
runes,
and
in
IP
terms
most
expensive,
the
expected
value
of
runes
given
by
the
combiner
is
quite
low,
as
the
probability
is
quite
higher
of
receiving
secondary
runes
and
other
runes
of
questionable
value.
In
addition,
some
reports
indicate
that
certain
runes
are
considerably
more
likely
to
appear
than
others,
though
this
has
not
been
verified
(seals
of
armor,
marks
of
scaling
attack
damage,
etc.).
