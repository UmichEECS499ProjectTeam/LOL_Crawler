The
Mogron

is
the
barrier
between
North

South
Valoran
,
in
the
middle
of
The
Great
Barrier
.
In
the
The
Journal
of
Justice:
Volume
1,
Issue
01
,
it
was
somewhat
revealed
that
Mogron
Pass
will
be
an
upcoming
Field
of
Justice
.
In
that
Journal
of
Justice
issue,
there
are
hints
about
two
nexus
with
considerable
magic
potency
that
have
been
discovered.
The
League
has
since
announced
plans
to
send
a
research
team
of
summoners
and
other
magicians
to
Kalamanda
to
inspect
the
nexuses
for
potential
future
management
and
use
by
the
League.
