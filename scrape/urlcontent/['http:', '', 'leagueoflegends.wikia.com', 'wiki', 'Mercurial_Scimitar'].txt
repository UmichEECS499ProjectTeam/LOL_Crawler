Mercurial
Scimitar
works
best
as
a
late
game
upgrade
for
AD
carries
from
Quicksilver
Sash
.
Mercurial
Scimitar
is
a
great
escaping
tool,
but
in
order
to
utilize
the
movement
buff
and
the
removal
of
crowd
control,
the
active
is
best
combined
with
blink
abilities
such
as
Flash
.
Mercurial
Scimitar
is
the
most
defensive
item
choice
out
of
all
the
possible
upgrades
for
B.
F.
Sword
.
If
Quicksilver
Sash
is
on
cooldown
and
you
upgrade
it
into
Mercurial
Scimitar
,
you
recover
the
ability
to
use
the
active
again.
Mercurial
Scimitar
can
remove
Grievous
Wound
,
unlike
Cleanse
.
