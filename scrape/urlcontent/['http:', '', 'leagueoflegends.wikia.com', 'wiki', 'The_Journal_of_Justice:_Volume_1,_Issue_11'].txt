Ionia’s
Fight
for
Freedom
Grudge
match
against
Noxus
coming
this
Friday;
summoners
and
spoils
announced
Auras
Lam
reporting
from
The
Institute
of
War
The
stage
is
set
for
the
most
hotly
anticipated
League
battle
of
the
year.
The
city-state
of
Noxus
,
having
enjoyed
the
spoils
of
Ionian
soil
for
the
last
7
years,
has
offered
Ionia
the
chance
to
re-claim
their
land
.
The
stakes
have
never
been
higher.
With
the
Noxian
occupation,
the
inhabitants
of
the
three
wealthiest
provinces
of
Ionia
have
been
forced
to
settle
into
the
Noxian
way
of
life,
however
grudgingly
so.
Ionia
has
excluded
representatives
from
these
captured
provinces
from
the
Convergence
of
Elders
as
a
means
to
prevent
political
corruption.
However,
by
agreeing
to
the
match
as
a
means
to
reclaim
their
land,
Ionia's
government
must
allow
the
inclusion
of
proper
representatives
from
the
provinces
of
Galrin,
Navori,
and
Shon-Xan
in
the
case
of
a
loss.
Should
Noxians
be
appointed
as
the
representatives,
the
Ionian
government
will
be
vulnerable
to
undesirable
influence.
Working
in
conjunction
with
the
city-states,
the
League
sought
out
summoners
of
the
highest
pedigree,
some
having
been
vocal
during
the
Ionian
protest.
The
Noxian
team,
represented
by
summoners
Vorath,
Edwy,
Roku,
Poisonidon,
and
Friend,
have
issued
the
following
statement:
"Summoners,
citizens,
champions
of
the
League.
We
gather
here
this
day
to
adjudicate,
by
trial
of
arms,
the
Noxian
expansion
into
the
fertile
Ionian
provinces.
It
must
not
be
that
our
hearts
burgeon
with
treacherous
emotion
in
these
trying
times.
Rather,
we
must
maintain
a
steely
eye,
an
even
demeanor,
and
argue
the
case
with
cool
logic,
and
colder
blades.
Let
not
the
wailings
of
the
Ionian
tenderhearts
influence
you
overly
-
Noxus
has
claimed
these
lands
by
lawful
conquest
on
the
Fields
of
Justice
once,
and
all
Runeterra
shall
stand
witness
as
we
do
so
again!"
Vehemently
awaiting
the
chance
to
liberate
Ionia
once
and
for
all,
the
Ionian
summoners
Poruku,
NeoIllusions,
Eclipse,
Frozt,
and
Guardsman
Bob
issued
the
following
reply:
"We're
determined
to
win,
and
we
have
our
most
advanced
strategies
prepared;
losing
is
not
an
option.
We
will
show
them
the
power
of
Ionia,
and
we
will
have
freedom
as
our
reward.
All
of
those
who
have
shown
support
will
not
be
let
down.
We
have
never
stopped
believing
that
the
citizens
of
southern
Ionia
should
have
the
freedom
to
live
as
they
desire,
without
the
heavy-handed
oppression
of
another
weighing
down
upon
them.
Without
a
doubt,
balance
shall
be
restored."
Regarding
the
match,
the
buzz
heard
echoing
throughout
Valoran
appears
heavily
slanted
in
Noxus'
favor,
stirring
up
unsettlingly
familiar
feelings
of
Noxian
machinations
behind
the
scenes.
However,
since
the
original
"Trial
for
the
Isle"
match
7
years
ago,
Ionia
has
seen
a
great
influx
of
champions
to
the
League.
Most
notably,
the
Ionian
Captain
of
the
Guard,
Irelia
,
and
several
members
of
the
widely
respected
Kinkou
clan
are
now
in
the
champion
lineup
for
the
match.
It
took
the
painful
loss
of
their
southern
provinces
to
bring
the
Kinkou
into
the
League,
as
the
Order
had
been
controversially
opposed
to
the
use
of
force
when
the
original
battle
occurred.
Now,
it
seems,
they
are
making
good
on
their
fervent
dedication
to
the
preservation
of
balance
in
Ionia,
even
if
it
means
charging
into
the
front
lines
of
battle.
The
summoners
representing
the
winning
city-states
will
be
honored
with
a
supervised
visit
to
the
Arcanum
Vault,
located
underneath
the
Institute
of
War.
They
will
be
the
first
city-state
affiliated
summoners
to
be
allowed
access
to
the
Vault.
They
will
be
presented
with
two
items
and
granted
the
privilege
to
select
one
to
be
added
to
shop
shelves
on
the
Fields
of
Justice.
The
item
will
be
named
in
honor
of
the
victor.
The
two
items
that
the
League
has
selected
are
a
pair
of
boots
and
an
item
from
the
famed
artificer
Doran's
collection.
Both
items
grant
unique
abilities
compared
to
the
existing
boots
and
Doran's
items
currently
available.
The
item
selected
for
sale
will
be
dedicated
in
the
winning
city-state's
honor.
Be
sure
to
tune
in
this
Friday
-
10
December,
20
CLE
-
in
order
to
witness
this
momentous
occasion.
The
League
has
made
special
arrangements
to
transmit
a
live
visiopathic
feed
of
the
match,
so
be
sure
to
cozy
up
with
your
fellow
statesmen
in
support
of
your
favored
team!
General
Du
Couteau
Vanishes
The
Noxian
High
Command
recognizes
Swain
as
the
successor
to
General
Du
Couteau
Richor
Ebony
reporting
from
Noxus
One
of
Noxus'
finest
children,
the
celebrated
General
Du
Couteau,
vanished
this
past
week
under
the
most
peculiar
of
circumstances.
Last
seen
slipping
away
from
his
entourage
during
a
trip
to
the
famed
marketplace
of
the
Ivory
Ward
--
the
oldest
and
most
opulent
of
Noxus'
historic
districts
--
the
General
never
returned
to
collect
his
coterie.
When
interviewed,
the
General's
retainers
said
that
he
appeared
extremely
agitated
prior
to
his
disappearance,
having
been
observed
on
multiple
occasions
checking
his
pocket
watch
at
frequent,
neurotic
intervals.
While
we
can
only
speculate
on
what
grave
errand
compelled
Du
Couteau
to
proceed
unguarded
into
the
city,
the
increasing
length
of
his
absence
does
not
bode
well
for
a
safe
return.
His
absence
has
been
especially
hard
on
his
family,
as
the
General's
daughter
Katarina,
the
famed
Sinister
Blade
,
has
been
unable
to
leave
the
Institute
of
War
to
tend
to
familial
affairs.
With
Du
Couteau's
whereabouts
unknown,
his
seat
on
the
Noxian
High
Command
stood
vacant.
As
a
result,
General
Boram
Darkwill
came
under
pressure
from
his
cabinet
to
fill
this
unoccupied
seat
on
the
advisory
council.
He
did
so
today
at
a
private
ceremony
held
deep
within
his
inner
sanctum
at
Darkbourne
Hold,
surprising
no
one
when
he
selected
League
Champion
and
Master
Tactician
Jericho
Swain
,
one
of
his
Lieutenant
Generals,
to
succeed
the
late
General
Du
Couteau.
In
a
brief
speech
punctuating
the
ceremony,
General
Darkwill
made
the
following
comment
to
his
latest
protégé:
"It
is
long
overdue
that
we
recognize
your
many
accomplishments,
your
cunning,
and,
above
all,
your
unwavering
loyalty
to
the
Empire
and
to
the
High
Command."
Perhaps
just
as
curious
as
the
circumstances
of
his
promotion
was
Swain's
choice
of
companionship
for
the
evening,
which
caused
quite
a
stir
at
the
proceedings.
On
his
arm
all
night
was
none
other
than
the
infamous
(and
notoriously
reclusive)
Emilia
LeBlanc
,
who
had
not
appeared
in
public
for
decades.
Despite
being
roughly
the
same
age
as
General
Darkwill
himself,
she
appeared
as
youthful
and
vibrant
as
ever.
The
years
have
been
far
kinder
to
her
than
to
her
hardened
associate;
a
fact
that
has
only
contributed
to
continued
speculation
regarding
the
circumstances
of
her
longevity.
This
disappearance
is
not
the
first
tragedy
to
haunt
the
Du
Couteau
clan
in
recent
memory.
Earlier
in
the
year,
Cassiopeia
,
Du
Couteau's
youngest
daughter
and
former
jewel
of
the
Noxian
court,
fell
grievously
ill
following
a
short-lived
romance
with
an
envoy
from
Freljord
.
She
has
since
shut
herself
up
in
her
chambers,
seemingly
never
to
return
to
the
public
eye.
While
her
current
condition
is
unknown,
the
mortality
rate
of
servants
in
the
Du
Couteau
household
has
reached
an
all
time
high,
sparking
panic-stricken
rumors
of
contagion.
It
has
been
said
her
father's
absence
has
thrown
the
household
into
uproar,
and
that
the
distraught
Cassiopeia's
fury
can
be
heard
echoing
through
the
Du
Couteau
estate
at
all
hours.
While
General
Swain's
official
promotion
was
executed
in
haste,
the
High
Command
intends
that
he
receive
all
the
honors
and
recognition
that
he
is
due.
A
proper
celebration
with
all
the
typical
military
pageantry
is
being
scheduled
for
the
coming
week.
It
is
likely
to
be
a
great
spectacle
given
the
celebrity
afforded
to
Swain
by
his
status
as
a
champion
of
the
League
of
Legends,
and
the
city's
major
tourist
attractions
are
preparing
for
a
significant
increase
in
traffic
during
this
time.
Honor
and
glory
to
General
Jericho
Swain
of
Noxus,
newest
member
of
the
High
Command!
Forever
strong!
Giant
Rats
Invade
Southern
Ionia
Noxus
High
Command
overreacts
to
infestation
Henril
Dreving
reporting
from
Ionia
Singed
was
summoned
to
the
Navori
Province
today
to
take
charge
in
the
eradication
of
an
unexpected
giant
rat
infestation.
The
Mad
Chemist
was
top
of
mind
after
his
deft
handling
of
a
lizard
population
surge
outside
the
Institute
of
War
last
spring.
His
arrival
comes
following
the
rodent
invasion
of
a
high-profile
officers'
banquet
celebrating
the
promotion
of
Chancellor
Malek
Hawkmoon's
son,
Ameer,
to
the
rank
of
Commander
in
the
Noxian
fleet.
According
to
witnesses,
screams
interrupted
the
Military
Anthem
when
child-sized
rats
hopped
onto
tables,
knocked
over
glassware,
and
pilfered
sides
of
meat
while
ignoring
the
best
efforts
of
broom-wielding
servants.
Immediately
afterwards,
several
officers
were
overheard
demanding
immediate
action
while
carrying
unconscious
wives
and
husbands
away
from
the
scene.
It
is
believed
that
the
infestation
began
after
several
Zaunite
armament
shipments
arrived
last
month.
Local
harbor
workers
first
noticed
the
rats
scurrying
ashore
on
mooring
lines
that
tied
the
boats
to
the
docks.
Before
the
banquet
incident
occurred,
reports
concerning
sightings
of
people
carried
off
by
swarms
of
rats
and
of
entire
food-storages
being
found
empty
have
largely
been
dismissed
as
rumors
by
the
Noxian
High
Command.
Local
security
has
noted
a
level
of
coordination
and
intelligence
behind
these
occurrences
that
suggests
the
presence
of
a
mastermind
overseeing
the
infestation.
Chancellor
Hawkmoon
commented
earlier
this
week:
"Zaun
has
been
our
trusted
ally
for
years
and
I'm
convinced
they
would
do
nothing
to
compromise
that
relationship.
However,
it's
my
firm
belief
that,
if
the
rats
did
come
from
Zaun
ships,
there
is
likely
only
one
creature
that
might
have
insight
into
the
matter.
We
will
be
asking
Zaun
authorities
to
investigate
further.
As
for
the
infestation
itself,
Singed
has
proven
that
he
is
adept
at
exterminating
vermin.
This
will
be
dealt
with."
With
the
accelerating
expansion
of
urban
city
centers,
demand
has
grown
for
exterminators
who
pack
increasingly
caustic
and
dangerous
chemicals.
Outside
of
his
participation
in
the
League
of
Legends,
Singed
has
built
a
business
out
of
handling
the
direst
infestations.
However,
there
are
unconfirmed
reports
that
side
effects
of
the
Master
Chemist's
work
are
more
devastating
than
the
infestations
themselves.
Whispers
of
entire
houses
sinking
into
acidic
pools
and
deadly
gas
clouds
floating
down
city
streets
have
been
only
the
most
benign
of
the
rumors.
Soraka,
the
Starchild
of
Ionia
,
responded
to
Hawkmoon’s
statement:
"Noxus
invades
my
beloved
island,
introduces
unnatural
pests,
and
then
expects
to
solve
this
crisis
with
corrosive
chemicals
and
destruction?
We
will
not
stand
for
this
assault
on
our
fragile
land.
The
League
of
Legends
must
recognize
this
occupation
for
what
it
is—a
clear
disregard
for
life
and
beauty
in
the
name
of
profit."
Singed
made
the
following
rebuttal:
"The
Starchild
doesn't
have
to
worry...
much.
Noxian
citizens
in
Ionia
will
be
perfectly
safe
from
my
improved
rodenticide
formulas.
I
have
nothing
to
say
about
whether
Zaun
is
or
isn't
involved
with
the
infestation
itself."
Slow
Down
Snowdown
Don't
get
your
snowflakes
in
a
tizzy
L.B.
Briskes
commenting
from
The
Institute
of
War
I
have
a
personal
message
for
all
of
you.
I've
written
several
columns
alongside
my
crackling
fireplace,
warmed
by
the
many
one-sided
conversations
we've
shared
through
my
pen.
Despite
all
the
bitterness
and
sarcasm
some
have
implied
that
I
pepper
into
my
writing,
I
would
like
to
thank
you
in
earnest
for
being
that
nameless,
faceless
person
on
the
other
side
of
the
print.
Without
you,
I
would
feel
as
though
my
words
simply
evaporate
into
the
ether.
My
vocal
disdain
would
be
merely
a
hermit's
grump.
In
particular,
I
would
like
to
thank
you
for
assisting
me
in
winning
a
wager
with
a
certain
Mr.
Farnsley
that
I
could
not
bring
myself
to
write
an
entire
paragraph
in
"the
holiday
spirit"
of
the
Time
of
Snowdown
without
any
"undue
sourness"
like
a
good
journalistic
puppet.
Drat,
he
is
sure
to
quibble
about
that
last
part.
Sentimental
blather
aside,
we
are
fast
approaching
another
holiday
(yes,
another)
before
my
neighbor
has
seen
fit
to
remove
the
shriveled,
grinning
pumpkin-turned-raisin
which
has
withered
on
his
doorstep
since
the
Harrowing
.
Had
I
known
earlier
that
he
desired
to
decorate
his
entryway
with
rotting
garbage,
I'd
have
eagerly
obliged
from
my
own
supply.
The
Time
of
Snowdown
is
arguably
the
most
significant
Runeterran
holiday
since
it
is
the
only
occasion
wherein
citizens
of
Valoran
have
historically
agreed
to
put
aside
their
petty
differences
for
a
short
time.
During
the
chaos
of
the
Rune
Wars,
this
was
frequently
the
only
time
soldiers
were
given
leave
to
return
home.
I've
even
heard
a
few
stories
of
sworn
enemies
dining
with
each
other
during
the
break
in
hostilities.
The
food
may
have
been
generously
spiced
with
arsenic
or
gunpowder,
but
good
intentions
sometimes
come
wrapped
in
melting
or
ticking
packages.
So
why
is
this
so
universally
a
time
of
peace
and
brotherhood?
As
some
have
been
keen
to
indicate,
the
Time
of
Snowdown
heralds
the
coming
of
a
new
year.
They
submit
that
people
all
over
the
continent
would
celebrate
the
fact
that,
despite
their
other
differences,
they
had
mutually
survived
the
past
year.
However,
as
a
patron
supporter
of
the
human
spirit,
I
tend
to
believe
people
would
have
happily
slaughtered
each
other
to
welcome
in
the
next
year
but
for
the
devastating
weather
which
wrought
havoc
on
the
population.
Valoran
has
always
been
home
to
unforgiving
winters,
but
in
the
wake
of
the
Rune
Wars,
the
climate
was
in
such
a
state
that
it
was
not
uncommon
for
a
particularly
vicious
blizzard
to
claim
thousands
of
lives
from
a
single
city-state.
Depending
on
your
feelings
about
your
neighbors,
this
may
have
made
for
a
somewhat
less
festive
occasion
(or
so
I'm
told).
So
families,
since
ancient
times,
would
band
together
for
fear
of
freezing
or
being
gored
by
the
errant
falling
icicle.
Now
people
simply
band
together
to
watch
the
Snowdown
Showdown
–
the
League
event
themed
for
the
Time
of
Snowdown.
Once
all
the
panties
have
been
un-knotted
surrounding
this
"Noxus
vs.
Ionia"
tiff,
we
are
sure
to
see
some
special
matches,
runes,
costumes
and
so
forth,
built
to
be
absorbed
by
the
public.
Enjoy.
For
my
part,
I
will
celebrate
by
absorbing
an
equivalent
amount
of
eggnog
and
looking
forward
to
seeing
paper
snowflakes
and
rotting
candy
on
my
neighbor's
doorstep
until
next
summer.
The

commenting
from
the
Institute
of
War
The
Journal
of
Justice
staff
has
been
running
themselves
ragged
reporting
on
news,
what
with
every
major
city-state
of
Valoran
embroiled
in
one
feud
or
another.
However,
one
of
our
greatest
joys
in
publishing
every
issue
is
reading
the
mail
that
comes
in
from
you,
our
loyal
readers.
"Can
summoners
become
champions?
And
can
champions
become
summoners
when
not
fighting
in
the
league?
If
so,
what
sanctions
would
have
to
be
put
in
place
to
make
this
happen?"
--
Boogeybeast
There
are
no
restrictions
against
summoners
becoming
champions
or
vice
versa.
However,
to
fight
on
the
Fields
of
Justice
requires
different
capabilities
–
for
champions,
extreme
physical
and
magical
prowess;
for
summoners,
unrelenting
control
of
esoteric
summoning
magic
in
order
to
establish
a
complete
symbiosis
with
a
champion
for
the
length
of
a
given
match.
Only
the
most
skilled
mages
and
fighters
on
Runeterra
are
accepted
into
the
League,
and
to
achieve
such
skills
at
a
competitive
level
requires
an
absolute
dedication
to
one's
craft.
While
it
would
take
a
contender
of
exceptional
merit
to
make
the
transition
within
the
League,
it
would
not
be
impossible.
Given
the
quality
of
champion
and
summoner
candidates
joining
the
League
lately,
it
certainly
seems
inevitable.
"
Zilean
's
affliction
with
chrono-displasia
and
his
struggle
to
find
a
cure
is
common
knowledge
by
today's
standards,
but
little
has
been
said
on
his
current
status.
Has
he
made
any
breakthroughs?
Is
he
recruiting
the
help,
say
from
Ryze
or
the
revered
inventor
himself
Heimerdinger
?
Since
it's
considered
a
disease
would
Dr.
Mundo
have
any
valid
input
on
his
case?"
--
Summoner
Survient
Chrono-displasia
is
unlike
anything
that
has
ever
been
seen
on
Runeterra,
and
the
magicians
in
the
Institute
of
War
are
probably
the
only
ones
with
the
knowledge
and
magical
power
necessary
to
find
a
cure,
which
was
the
reason
Zilean
initially
came
to
the
League
of
Legends.
Zilean
has
been
in
constant
consult
with
Ryze,
and
their
latest
attempt
to
cure
chrono-displasia
uses
a
form
of
magic
similar
to
that
used
by
summoners
on
the
Fields
of
Justice.
As
Zilean
is
seized
with
visions
from
the
exact
point
in
time
that
Urtistan
was
destroyed,
he
shares
his
mind
with
Ryze,
who
examines
the
illusion
for
anomalies.
So
far,
they
have
been
able
to
pinpoint
distinct
pockets
of
strange
energy.
They
have
found
that
the
most
powerful
and
puzzling
energy
source
emits
a
magical
aura
that
gives
off
a
waveform
nearly
identical
to
that
of
Zilean’s
own
mind.
Beyond
that,
the
Journal
of
Justice
staff
has
no
further
knowledge,
but
with
Ryze
deep
in
research
on
the
subject,
the
answer
is
sure
to
come
soon.
"While
summoning
the
champion
"
Olaf
"
during
routine
matches,
this
summoner
has
heard
him
mention
his
fondness
of
long
beards
and
large
belt
buckles.
Other
champions
seem
to
share
this,
such
as
Zilean,
Gragas
,
and
Gangplank
;
the
latter
of
which
obviously
follows
a
similar
trend
as
Olaf.
Has
the
Journal
of
Justice
witnessed
any
encounters
between
the
champions?"
--
Ionian
Summoner,
Logan
"Morrowlife"
Jacobs
Funny
that
you
should
ask
this
question,
Morrowlife!
Gragas
recently
invited
the
Journal
of
Justice
staff
down
to
the
Lamplighter
Inn
in
Noxus
for
a
promotional
event
for
his
wildly
popular
brewery.
After
more
rounds
of
Graggy
Ice
than
would
be
proper
to
publish,
our
beloved
bearded
champions
got
into
a
heated
argument
about
the
intricacies
of
facial
hair
grooming.
The
disagreement
erupted
into
a
brawl
that
nearly
leveled
Noxus'
Vexallian
Square,
only
to
be
abated
by
the
promise
of
a
'Beard
Brawl
Bowl'
at
a
later
date.
Gragas
has
been
petitioning
the
League
to
allow
the
fight
on
the
Fields
of
Justice,
with
only
bearded
or
mustached
champions
in
the
lineup.
Although
the
League
does
not
have
a
history
of
allowing
personal
grudge
matches
onto
its
Fields,
perhaps
it
will
make
an
exception
for
its
highly
regarded
champions.
I
imagine
that
Noxus'
commercial
district
would
certainly
appreciate
staying
intact
for
another
decade.
