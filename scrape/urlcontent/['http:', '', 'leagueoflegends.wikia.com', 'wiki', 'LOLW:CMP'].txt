This
page
documents
an
official
League
of
Legends
Wiki
policy.
It
is
a
widely
accepted
standard
that
should
normally
be
followed
by
all
editors.
Kickban
When
you
kickban
someone
or,
as
it
seems
some
chat
moderators
do,
change
their
user
group
to
kickbanned
via
Special:UserRights
,
you
will,
as
per
the
chat
policy,
leave
a
message
on
the
user
you
banned
from
chat's
talk
page
with
the
following
template
{{Bannedfromchat|1|2}}
followed
by
your
signature,
the
1
will
be
where
you
put
the
reason
they
were
kickbanned,
the
2
will
be
where
you
put
the
appropriate
time
in
accordance
with
the
policy.
The
template
does
not
create
a
new
section
on
their
talk
page,
so
you
have
to
create
a
new
section
yourself
and
place
the
template
within,
make
sure
to
keep
the
section
title
appropriate.
The
template
will
insert
the
following
text:
You
were
banned
from
chat
for
the
following
reason:
{{{1}}}.
The
duration
of
your
ban
is
{{{2}}}.
You
may
contact
an
admin
to
lift
your
ban
after
this
duration.
Screenshots
are
not
mandatory
but
are
not
only
appreciated
but
also
important
in
the
case
a
chat
ban
gets
questioned
or
opposed.
Screenshots
that
include
snippets
are
not
acceptable,
the
whole
chat
pertaining
to
the
incident
must
be
captured
for
it
to
be
acceptable.
Consequences
If
a
Chat
Moderator
does
not
follow
these
policies
consequential
action
will
be
taken
by
either
an
admin
or
a
bureaucrat,
after
consultation
with
another
admin
or
bureaucrat.
This
action
may
range
from
a
warning
being
issued
to
the
Chat
Moderator
or
the
removal
of
Chat
Moderator
rights
from
the
user
with
a
potential
wiki
or
chat
ban.
The
level
of
action
will
be
up
to
the
admin
or
bureaucrat
serving
the
action.
