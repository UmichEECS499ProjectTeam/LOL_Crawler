The
subject
of
this
article
was
removed
from
League
of
Legends
.
The
information
displayed
is
no
longer
relevant
to
League
of
Legends,
but
exists
here
for
historical
purposes.
Elo
rating
system
was
used
in
League
of
Legends
ranked
games
prior
to
Season
Three
when
the
League
system
was
introduced.
The
Elo
rating
system
is
a
method
for
calculating
the
relative
skill
levels
of
players,
originally
designed
for
two-player
games
such
as
chess.
It
is
named
after
its
creator
Arpad
Elo
,
a
Hungarian
American
physics
professor
and
chessplayer.
[1]
The
Elo
system
was
invented
as
an
improved
chess
rating
system,
but
today
it
has
been
adapted
for
use
in
many
other
games.
Variations
of
it
are
also
used
as
a
rating
system
for
multiplayer
competition
in
a
number
of
games
and
has
been
adapted
to
team
sports
including
association
football,
American
college
football
and
basketball,
and
Major
League
Baseball.
In
League
of
Legends
the
Elo
rating
of
a
player
was
used
by
the
matchmaking
in
ranked
games
to
find
other
players
of
a
similar
skill
level
to
play
with/against
before
the
introduction
of
the
League
system
in
Season
Three
.
Elo
was
not
used
for
custom
and
Co-op
vs.
AI
games.
The
Elo
rating
for
ranked
games
was
different
for
each
type
of
queue:
3v3
arranged,
5v5
solo
and
5v5
arranged
teams.
The
rating
was
only
visible
for
ranked
games
after
5
games
played
in
a
certain
queue
type.
Players
were
awarded
with
medals
in
their
summoner
profile
based
on
their
Elo
at
the
conclusion
of
Season
One
and
Season
Two
.
These
medals
were
given
as
follows:
[2]
Bronze
(Old)
:
Between
1250
and
1399
(3v3:
1249-1409,
pre-made
5v5:
1249-1409)
(Top
25%)
Silver
(Old)
:
Between
1400
and
1519
(3v3:
1410-1519,
pre-made
5v5:
1410-1499)
(Top
10%)
Gold
(Old)
:
Between
1520
and
1899
(3v3:
1520-1699,
pre-made
5v5:
1500-1749)
(Top
3%)
Platinum
(Old)
:
1900
and
above
(3v3:
1700+,
pre-made
5v5:
1750+)
(Top
0.2%)
About
a
month
before
the
end
of
Season
2,
a
new
rating
tiers
system
was
introduced:
[3]
Bronze:
Between
0
and
1149
(Team:
0-1249)
(Top
100%)
Silver:
Between
1150
and
1499
(Team:
1250-1449)
(Top
68%-13%)
Majority
of
Active
Player
Base
Gold:
Between
1500
and
1849
(Team:
1450-1649)
(Top
13%-1.5%)
Platinum:
Between
1850
and
2199
(Team:
1650-1849)
(Top
1.5%-0.1%)
Diamond:
2200
and
above
(Team:
1850+)
(Top
0.1%)
In
addition,
rankings
were
subdivided
into
smaller
sections,
like
Bronze
V
or
Gold
II.
These
are
sectioned
off
every
seventy
points
of
elo
(1150-1220
is
Silver
V,
1220-1290
is
Silver
IV,
etc.).
These
were
the
tiers
for
the
North
American
platform,
they
differed
a
bit
for
other
platforms.

Calculating
Elo
The
specific
formulas
which
were
used
for
Elo
calculations
in
League
of
Legends
are
unknown.
However,
most
Elo
implementations
share
the
same
basics
as
that
originally
designed
for
chess.
A
brief
summary
is
given
below.
For
a
more
detailed
discussion,
see
Wikipedia
.
It
is
assumed
that
a
person's
performance
varies
from
game
to
game
in
approximately
a
normal
distribution
and
a
person's
Elo
rating
was
the
mean
of
that
distribution.
A
person
with
a
higher
Elo
may
perform
better
on
average
than
a
player
with
a
lower
Elo,
although
usually
it
was
mainly
to
do
with
the
teamwork
around
that
player.
This
score
was
determined
entirely
by
win/loss
statistics
in
relation
to
other
players.
For
players
A
and
B
with
respective
Elo
ratings
of
Ra
and
Rb
the
expected
victorious
outcome
Ea
of
the
game
for
player
A
was
given
by
the
following
formula:
For
every
difference
of
400
points,
the
team/player
with
the
higher
score
is
ten
times
as
likely
to
win
as
the
other
team/player.
This
standard
is
for
Chess
and
may
have
been
different
in
League
of
Legends.
After
a
game
the
actual
outcome
was
compared
to
the
expected
outcome
and
each
team/players
rating
is
adjusted
to
bring
them
closer
to
where
they
should
actually
be.
As
a
result,
if
a
team
was
expected
to
win
and
does
their
score
changes
less
than
if
they
were
expected
to
lose
and
instead
won.
Successive
games
would
have
eventually
brought
each
player/team
to
a
point
where
they
were
expected
to
win
50%
of
the
time
against
opponents
of
equal
score.
A
player's
change
in
rating
was
linear
to
the
difference
between
the
expected
outcome
and
the
actual
outcome.
It
was
given
by
the
following
formula
where
Sa
is
the
result
of
the
game
and
is
presumably
1
for
a
win
and
0
for
a
loss.
The
magnitude
of
the
score
change
was
determined
by
the
player's
K
value
and
other
things,
like
a
server
crash
(When
the
score
you
get
is
50%).
In
chess
initially
this
K
value
is
big
(25
for
their
first
30
games)
resulting
in
large
changes
in
Elo.
This
is
so
a
player
can
rapidly
find
her
or
his
correct
place
in
the
ranking
system.
As
their
number
of
wins
and
losses
became
more
even
this
K
value
was
reduced
to
prevent
dramatic
changes
in
Elo
against
evenly
matched
opponents
(
K
=
15
to
7).
This
also
prevented
inflation
in
ratings
at
high
Elo
play.
It
appears
that
League
of
Legends
used
a
similar
system
of
changing
K
values:
K
appeared
to
be
starting
around
100,
eventually
leveling
out
to
about
25.
[4]
All
players
started
ranked
play
with
an
Elo
of
1200
for
their
first
10
games
at
level
30.
From
there
they
were
assigned
a
score
and
changes
are
made
as
normal.
[5]
Elo
decay
Prior
to
the
Season
2
rating
system
remake,
Elo
decayed
over
time
when
you
were
above
1400
Elo:
[6]
Elo
decayed
at
a
rate
of
50
Elo
for
Diamonds,
35
Elo
for
Platinums,
25
Elo
for
Golds,
10
Elo
for
Silver,
and
0
Elo
for
Bronze
for
every
4
consecutive
weeks
of
inactivity
and
every
7
days
thereafter.
For
normal
rating,
inactivity
was
defined
as
no
activity
in
any
queue.
For
ranked
rating,
inactivity
was
defined
as
no
activity
in
the
specific
queue
(arranged
5x5,
arranged
3x3,
and
solo/duo
5x5
are
all
tracked
separately).
Ranked
decay
only
applied
to
people
who
were
ranked
above
1400
rating.
The
decay
timer
was
reset
after
a
game
was
played
in
that
specific
queue.
Elo
FAQ
Elo
changes
were
higher
for
the
first
~50
games
ranging
from
50-13.
Duo-queuing
never
affected
elo
gains/losses.
The
Elo
rating
showed
only
after
the
first
5
games,
but
elo
placement
required
10
games.
The
Chinese/QQ
servers
still
use
the
Elo
Rating
System
because
of
the
bugginess
of
the
League
system
in
their
client.
