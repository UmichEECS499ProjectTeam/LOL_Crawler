cost
and
for
the
same
effect.
Applying

enchantment

not
impact
on

becoming

reaching

Notes
The
1%
movement
speed
effect
bonus
does
not
show
any
status
icon
on
affected
allied
champions.
To
benefit
from
the
10%
movement
speed
bonus,
allies
must:
be
within
roughly
1100
range
of
the
aura
holder;
be
facing
him/her.
The
movement
speed
stat
increase
is
still
visible
even
if
they
are
not
moving.
Because
of
the
above
conditions,
it
does
not
help
allies
travel
across
the
map
faster
towards
the
holder.
Rather,
it
is
similar
to
a
passive,
conditional,
weaker
Talisman
of
Ascension
active.
It
is
well
used
aggressively
on
a
frontline
tank/initiator,
which
will
help
allies
follow
up
on
his
movements.
It
is
well
used
defensively
on
a
backline
support,
which
will
help
others
retreat.
The
additional
movement
speed
aura
will
stack
for
minions
and
pets.
This
is
the
other
aura
that
can
be
used
to
improve
champion
pets,
along
with
Banner
of
Command
.
Patch
history
November
20th
:
Minion
movement
speed
aura
reduced
to
20%
from
25%.
