Death
Recap
is
the
damage
recap
feature
before
a
champion's
death
in
League
of
Legends
.
Gameplay
It
is
displayed
when
a
player’s
champion
has
been
slain
;
the
player
can
open
the
Death
Recap
window
which
will
summarize
all
of
the
damage
they
received
during
their
final
moments.
At
the
bottom
of
the
recap
window,
it
shows
the
total
of
the
damage,
and
the
amount
of
time
in
which
it
occurred.
The
Death
Recap
window
provides
informative
tips
on
how
to
avoid
being
killed
by
the
same
Champion
and
spells
again
by
hovering
over
the
Champion's
section
of
the
window
or
hovering
over
the
spell
icon
respectively.
It
also
displays
the
items
the
killing
and
assisting
Champions
have,
and
the
stats
of
those
items.
The
fatal
damage
taken
is
broken
down
on
an
integer
and
percentage
basis,
so
that
players
can
have
a
complete
and
thorough
understanding
of
exactly
how
they
were
taken
down.
A
few
glitches
still
exist,
such
as
towers
adding
to
a
Champion's
basic
attack
damage.
These
glitches
are
negligible,
however.
In
the
death
recap,
there
are
some
spells
such
as
Toxic
Shot
which
modify
basic
attacks,
and
so
it
counts
for
all
the
damage.
For
example,
you
could
see
Teemo
hit
1600
with
Toxic
Shot
.
Additionally,
damage
dealt
by
the
Nexus
Obelisk
does
not
show
up
on
the
Death
Recap
in
any
form.
