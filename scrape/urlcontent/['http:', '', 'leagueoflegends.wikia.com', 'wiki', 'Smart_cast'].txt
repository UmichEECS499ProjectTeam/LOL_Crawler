Smart
cast
Quick
cast
is
a
characteristic
of
some
abilities
in
League
of
Legends
.
This
was
previously
called
"smart
cast"
but
was
renamed
by
Riot
in
version
3.12
.
Many
players
still
refer
to
it
as
smart
cast.
All
champion
abilities
can
be
set
to
quick
cast
using
the
in-game
options
screen.
Gameplay
Quick
cast
automatically
casts
the
selected
ability
at
(or
towards)
the
current
mouse
cursor
position,
as
if
you
had
first
pressed
the
ability
button
and
then
left-clicked
at
the
target
position.
Quick
cast
works
for
self-buff
abilities,
targeted
abilities,
ground-targeted
abilities
and
skillshots
.
Quick
casting
a
support
buff
ability
(an
ability
that
can
be
cast
on
yourself
e.g.
a
shield
or
a
heal)
when
the
cursor
is
on
an
invalid
target
will
self-cast
the
ability
instead.
Note
that
you
can
use
self-casting
to
self-cast
support
buff
abilities
regardless
of
cursor
location.
Using
quick
cast
can
be
invaluable
because
it
reduces
the
time
delay
between
activating
and
casting
by
cutting
the
user
input
in
half;
activate
vs
activate
and
click.
Remember
that
quick
casting
means
you
don't
get
the
targeting
graphic,
which
can
make
it
harder
to
accurately
aim
skillshots.
They
will
fire
instantly,
instead
of
showing
the
skillshot
for
fine
tuning
the
shot.
However,
there
is
an
option
to
turn
range
indicators
on,
which
will
show
the
targeting
graphic
while
the
ability
key
is
pressed.
This
can
also
be
helpful
because
the
ability
can
then
be
canceled
by
right-clicking.
List
of
abilities
that
quick
cast
The
following
abilities
automatically
employ
quick
cast:
Ahri's
Spirit

Cassiopeia's

Quick
cast
for
special
skill
shots
Complex
skill
shots,
such
as
vector
skill
shots
like
Rumble's
The
Equalizer
,
and
Viktor's
Death
Ray
,
can
be
quick
cast
by
holding
down
the
quick
cast
hotkey
to
mark
the
beginning
of
the
line,
and
releasing
the
hotkey
to
cast.
Tapping
the
quick
cast
key
normally
will
result
in
a
straight
forward
skill
shot
fired
in
the
same
direction
as
the
champion.
This
method
of
quick
cast
was
introduced
in
V1.0.0.129
to
allow
vector
skill
shots
like
The
Equalizer
to
be
used
with
quick
cast.
