During
the
2011
PAX,
Riot
Games
Inc.
did
a
promotional
event
with
Razer
[1]
,
in
which
players
registered
on
Razer's
website,
and
in
exchange
were
emailed
a
code
which
could
be
redeemed
in
the
store
for
two
limited
edition
runes
.
Discussion
on
the
NA
forums
resulted
in
a
741-page
thread
[2]
,
where
US
and
EU
players
discovered
that
a
single
code
could
be
redeemed
separately
in
each
region.
Runes
Each
code
could
be
redeemed
for
the
following
free
runes
in
the
store.
They
give
the
same
stats
as
normal
tier
3
runes.
There
was
no
limit
to
how
many
of
these
codes
could
be
redeemed
per
account,
however
each
one
required
a
unique
email
address
to
redeem.
