Armed
with
wit,
charm,
and
his
signature
transforming
hammer,
Jayce
lives
to
protect
his
native
Piltover
.
Long
before
his
nation
called
him
a
hero,
however,
he
was
a
promising
young
inventor.
When
Piltover
commissioned
him
to
study
a
rare
arcane
crystal,
Jayce
discovered
it
could
be
used
as
a
vast
energy
source.
Eager
to
make
a
name
for
himself,
he
began
developing
a
device
to
harness
its
power.
Word
of
the
crystal's
potential
reached
beyond
the
borders
of
Piltover.
Viktor
,
the
machine-augmented
scientist
from
Zaun
,
brought
Jayce
an
offer
–
together,
they
could
use
the
crystal
to
advance
his
"glorious
evolution,"
a
vision
of
humanity
fused
with
technology.
Jayce
refused,
but
the
Zaunite
had
no
intention
of
leaving
empty
handed.
He
effortlessly
blasted
Jayce
aside
and
seized
the
crystal,
incinerating
the
lab's
meager
security
force
as
he
left
for
Zaun.
Jayce
implored
the
Piltover
government
to
respond,
but
the
officials
refused
to
support
an
act
of
aggression.
He
decided
to
act
alone,
realizing
that
if
no
one
struck
back,
Piltover
would
never
be
safe.
Jayce
returned
to
the
lab
to
prepare
for
his
attack.
After
intense
research,
development,
and
hands-on
testing,
he
emerged
with
his
crowning
achievement
–the
Mercury
Hammer.
Weapon
in
hand,
Jayce
marched
to
Zaun
and
began
his
one-man
assault.
Viktor's
acolytes
rushed
to
stop
him,
but
Jayce
smashed
them
aside,
fighting
his
way
into
the
heart
of
the
lab.
Inside,
Jayce
saw
the
horrifying
brilliance
of
Viktor's
creations,
all
powered
by
the
energy
of
the
arcane
crystal.
He
realized
that
his
only
option
was
to
destroy
the
power
source,
but
Viktor
stood
in
his
way.
Though
their
clash
left
both
scientists
heavily
wounded,
Jayce
managed
a
desperate
strike
at
the
crystal.
He
shattered
it
and
escaped
as
Viktor's
machines
erupted
in
flames.
When
he
returned
home,
exhausted
but
victorious,
the
citizens
of
Piltover
hailed
Jayce
as
a
hero.
He
reveled
in
the
adoration,
but
knew
that
his
actions
had
drawn
the
attention
of
dangerous
enemies.
Now
devoted
to
the
defense
of
his
people,
Jayce
is
Piltover's
best
hope
for
a
bright
future.
"Trust
me:
if
we're
smart,
Piltover
can
stand
strong
against
any
threat.
Hey,
I'm
living
proof."
―
Jayce
Armed
with
wit,
charm,
and
his
signature
transforming
hammer,
Jayce
lives
to
protect
his
native
Piltover
.
He
rose
to
prominence
as
an
inventor,
one
whose
magnetic
personality
and
innovative
creations
brightened
the
lives
of
his
nation's
people.
However,
his
technological
marvels
also
attracted
the
attention
of
Piltover's
enemies.
Viktor
,
the
machine-augmented
scientist
from
Zaun
,
staged
a
deadly
raid
on
Jayce's
laboratory,
barely
impeded
by
the
lab's
meager
security
force.
Viktor
stole
designs
for
an
arcane
power
converter.
Jayce
feared
that
Viktor
would
create
weapons
of
devastating
power
with
the
stolen
technology.
He
implored
the
Piltover
government
to
respond,
but
the
officials
were
unwilling
to
support
an
act
of
aggression.
Refusing
to
allow
his
own
inventions
to
threaten
the
people
of
Piltover,
Jayce
decided
to
strike
back
against
Viktor
himself.
Jayce
returned
to
his
laboratory
and
began
making
preparations
for
his
one-man
attack.
After
an
intense
period
of
research,
development,
and
hands-on
testing,
he
emerged.
He
had
created
an
array
of
powerful
armaments,
including
his
crowning
achievement
–
the
versatile,
transforming
Mercury
Hammer.
Armed
and
ready,
Jayce
began
his
assault,
easily
smashing
aside
Viktor's
acolytes
as
they
rushed
to
stop
him.
Jayce
fought
his
way
into
the
heart
of
the
lab
and
confronted
Viktor,
forcing
the
Zaunite
to
flee.
After
destroying
Viktor's
prototype
weapon,
Jayce
returned
to
Piltover
where
he
was
hailed
as
a
hero.
He
reveled
in
the
adoration,
but
he
knew
that
his
actions
had
provoked
the
nation's
enemies.
Now
devoted
to
the
defense
of
his
people,
Jayce
is
Piltover's
best
hope
for
a
bright
future.

for
the
League
to
acquire
a
Renaissance
man,
then
your
long
wait
is
over.
Meet
Jayce,
the
Defender
of
Tomorrow.
In
addition
to
being
a
class
act
and
charmer,
this
modern
gentleman
is
one
of
Piltover's
premier
scientific
geniuses.
This
brazen,
well-equipped
man
for
all
seasons
sports
hi-tech
armor
and
wields
the
skull-crushing
Mercury
Hammer
that
also
transforms
into
the
Mercury
Cannon.
Whether
you
want
to
get

close
and
personal

gigantic
blunt
instrument
or
shake
things
up
by
peppering
opponents
with
energy
blasts
from
a
distance,
Jayce
has
the
skills

takes
to
deliver.

the
Defender
of

If
you're
ready
to
add
a
little
versatility
to
your
fighter
or
ranged
carry
game,
look
no
further
than
Jayce,
the
Defender
of
Tomorrow.
Jayce's
transforming
weapon
allows
him
to
adapt
to
nearly
any
situation,
making
him
an
extremely
versatile
champion
for
whatever
role
you
need
filled
on
the
Fields
of
Justice.
The
lynchpin
in
Jayce's
kit
is
his
ultimate.
Starting
with
a
free
rank
at
level
1,
Jayce
can
activate
his
ultimate
to
transform
his
weapon
into
either
the
short
range
Mercury
Hammer
or
the
long
range
Mercury
Cannon.
Each
time
he
transitions
he'll
receive
a
bonus
effect
on
his
next
basic
attack
that
either
shreds
the
target's
defensive
stats
(ranged
mode)
or
deals
significantly
increased
damage
(melee
mode).
Selecting
the
right
weapon
type
for
your
current
engagement
is
the
key
to
playing
Jayce
effectively.
While
ranged,
Jayce
can
pepper
enemies
with
ranged
attacks,
deploying
Shock
Blast
and
Hypercharge
to
wear
down
opponents
while
utilizing
Acceleration
Gate
to
Keep
his
team
at
a
safe
distance.
Having
worn
an
enemy
down
in
this
manner,
Acceleration
Gate
can
be
repurposed
to
give
chase,
allowing
him
to
shift
his
weapon
into
its
hammer
form
and
leap
into
the
fray
with
To
the
Skies!
Once
he's
closed
the
distance,
he
can
utilize
Thundering
Blow
to
pick
up
a
quick
kill,
while
the
additional
armor
from
being
in
melee
mode
gives
him
the
toughness
necessary
to
either
withdraw
or
continue
fighting
at
close
range.
However
you
choose
to
play
Jayce,
canny
shifting
between
his
weapon
modes
will
make
or
break
your
success
on
the
battlefield.
