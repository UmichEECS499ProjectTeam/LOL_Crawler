Trivia
Kayle's
story,
along
with
her
sister,
Morgana
,
closely
resembles
the
story
of
Michael
and
Lucifer
in
the
Christian
epic
poem
Paradise
Lost
.
Kayle,
along
with
Poppy
,
are
the
only
champions
for
450
that
do
not
have
the
recommended
attribute
tag.
Kayle
is
voiced
by
Lisa
Lindsley,
who
also
voices
Soraka
.
Kayle
is
the
first
and
so
far
only
champion
capable
of
giving
full
invulnerability
to
damage.
With
the
exception
to
the
Nexus
Obelisk
,
which
is
unaffected
by
any
forms
of
invulnerability.
Along
with
Thresh
and
Vel'Koz
,
they
are
the
only
champions
that
uses
ranged
attacks
without
projectiles.
She
however
remains
the
only
champion
that
doesn't
actually
hit
her
target
with
anything
while
attacking
it.
Kayle
is
the
first
champion
that
had
their
dance
changed
after
initial
release.
The
next
was
Veigar
.
Kayle's
dance
references
from
Will
Smith's
series
The
Fresh
Prince
of
Bel-Air
.
The
reference
can
be
seen
here
.
Kayle
was
originally
called
Judicator
during
the
alpha
period.
Kayle
is
the
first
champion
to
have
their
abilities
reworked
3
times
since
her
release.
Kayle
is
the
first
champion
to
utilize
their
Chinese
artwork
in
the
NA,
EUW
and
EUNE
servers
(zoomed
in).
As
stated
several
times
in
The
Journal
of
Justice
and
some
League
Judgements,
Kayle
works
as
an
investigator,
match
moderator
and
bodyguard
for
the
League.
She
often
has
had
to
intervene
to
save
summoners
and
other
champions
from
events
gone
wrong.
For
a
time
Kayle's
attribute
list
incorrectly
said
she
was
a
tank.
Kayle
shares
a
quote
with
Sion
:
"Lead
me
to
battle"
.
Skins
Kayle's
Classic
splash
art
received
some
tweaks,
scheduled
for
release
on
the
Kha'Zix
patch,
due
to
the
similarities
of
the
rock
formations
in
this
art
and
the
image
of
the
Iona,
Shield
of
Emeria
card.
Silver
Kayle
is
one
of
the
four
Collector's
Edition
skins,
the
other
champions
with
this
distinction
are
Alistar
,
Annie
and
Ryze
.
It
can
be
obtained
by
buying
the
Retail
Copy
of
the
Collector's
Edition.
The
Chinese
Classic
Kayle
art
is
used
as
the
Tribunal
image.
Also,
it
is
the
same
image
that
it
is
used
on
the
page
"The
Tribunal",
on
the
game
start
screen
(or
lobby).
Judgment
Kayle
was
a
free
gift,
given
to
those
who
played
a
certain
number
of
games
at
the
end
of
Season
1.
The
skin
is
a
reference
to
the
comic
book
character
Judge
Dredd
,
most
notably
the
shoulder
plates.
Battleborn
Kayle
was
first
leaked
in
Brand's
art
spotlight
in
which
it
was
originally
named
Gunmetal
Kayle
which
can
be
seen
here
.
The
story
behind
Kayle's
Aether
Wing
skin
is
based
on
an
alternate
fantasy,
in
which,
following
the
loss
of
her
wings
for
unknown
reasons,
she
has
reclaimed
the
secrets
of
the
master
craftsmen
that
once
inhabited
her
planet
and
forged
a
new
pair
of
beautiful,
transcendent
ailerons
and
brought
an
end
to
the
ancient
war
that
plagued
her
people
and
lifted
her
world
into
paradise.
Her
dance
in
this
skin
is
Night
of
Fire
by
the
Japanese
band
Dream
.
A
side-by-side
comparison
can
be
seen
here.
Aether
Wing
Kayle
bears
a
strong
resemblance
to
Uriel
and
other
angels
from
the
Darksiders
series.
Relations
Morgana
is
Kayle's
sister
and
seeks
to
defeat
her.
Kayle
had
a
part
in
subjugating
Maokai
when
he
accidentally
came
to
life,
she
shielded
the
present
crowd
from
the
confused
treant
as
he
involuntarily
unleashed
blasts
of
arcane
magic.
This
event,
however,
is
presumably
no
longer
canonical
following
the
changes
to
Maokai
's
lore.
