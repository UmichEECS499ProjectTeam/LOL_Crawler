League
of
Legends
Wiki
presents
the
Beginner's
Guide
Project
Page
for
League
of
Legends
,
the
first
game
of
Riot
Games
Inc.
This
guide
covers
from
before
the
Creation
of
the
Account
to
the
simplest
in-game
basics.

Gaining
Access
To
The
Game
First
of
all,
an
account
is
needed
to
be
created
using
the
sign
up
page
.
It
should
be
noted
that
whatever
name
you
choose
in
this
process
will
NOT
be
the
one
that
is
visible
to
others
while
playing
the
game
-
this
is
separately
chosen
at
a
later
point.
After
the
registration
is
completed,
you
can
now
download
the
game
using
the
large
red
'Download
the
Game'
button
that
you
are
redirected
to.
In
case
of
any
errors
or
a
misnavigation,
it
can
be
downloaded
here
instead.
After
some
initial
preparations
the
download
of
the
gmae
will
commence.
Be
patient
once
this
happens
-
League
of
Legends
is
a
large
program,
so
this
can
take
quite
a
long
time!
When
the
file
finishes,
complete
the
steps
and
install
the
game.
Login
Screen
Meanwhile,
you
can
take
your
time
to
read
the
Summoners
Code.
The
Summoner's
Code
acts
as
a
guideline
towards
healthy
and
productive
behavior
when
playing
the
game
and
shows
how
a
model,
responsible
and
sportsmanlike
player
will
act.
After
a
while,
you
should
witness
the
'League
of
Legends'
launcher
icon
pop
up
in
your
chosen
installation
directory.
Run
it
and
let
the
game
patch
to
the
current
date.
As
with
the
download
itself,
this
may
take
quite
a
while,
depending
on
your
connection.
After
it
is
done,
you
may
finally
press
the
big
and
orange
'Play'
button
to
open
the
PVP.net
client.
The
screen
that
greets
you
will
change
from
time
to
time
as
the
login
screen
is
updated
with
each
new
champion
release
and
major
event.
Enter
your
account
information
that
you
registered
with
to
login.
A
window
should
pop
up
asking
you
to
pick
a
summoner
name
-
this
is
the
name
that
people
will
recognize
you
for
while
playing.
As
it
cannot
be
changed
without
a
small
transaction
of
money,
you
should
choose
this
wisely!
In
order
to
start
playing,
you
also
need
to
pick
an
icon.
Unlike
the
name,
an
icon
can
be
freely
changed
at
any
time
by
clicking
its
picture
in
the
top
right
corner.
Your
Summoner
"Summoner"
is
the
players
in-game
avatar.
Each
is
defined
by
a
name
and
an
icon.
The
summoner
represents
the
persistent
part
of
the
game,
as
every
match
starts
from
scratch.
With
every
battle
you
take
part
in,
the
summoner
will
gain
Experience
and
Influence
Points.
Expirience
(EXP)
is
used
to
level
up,
while
Influence
Points
(IP)
is
the
game
currency
which
is
used
to
unlock
champions
and
runes.
Each
level,
until
30,
the
summoner
gains
one
mastery
point
and
one
rune
slot.
The
game
client
Unlike
other
games,
a
match
does
not
directly
effect
the
next
one
and
not
being
effected
by
the
last
one.
The
things
that
are,
however,
is
your
summoner
progress
which
can
be
viewed
in
the
client.
In
it,
you
can
see
your
level
or
ranking,
owned
champions,
chat
with
other
summoners,
match
history
and
more.
The
spacific
options
will
be
detailed
below.
Home
Page
The
default
page
you
land
in
when
you
log
in.
On
the
top,
you
should
see
the
big
red
"Play"
button.
Using
it,
you
may
pick
the
desired
mode
and
enter
a
queue
in
case
of
a
matched
game
or
look
for
a
game
manualy
using
the
custom
game
feature.
The
game
icon
will
be
displayed
on
the
left,
and
near
it
there
is
an
information
box
in
case
of
an
error.
It
will
mostly
be
empty.
On
the
right,
your
summoner
basic
information
is
being
presented:
icon,
name,
level
progress
and
your
amount
of
currency.
The
left
number
indicates
your
amount
of
Riot
Points
(RP),
and
the
right
Influence
Points
(IP).
You
can
use
those
points
in
the
store
-
the
orange
icon
below
your
profile.
A
more
insightful
information
about
your
sumonner
can
be
seen
by
clicking
on
the
profile
button.
The
last
2
ones
are
either
lore,
which
hasn't
been
updated
in
a
long
while,
or
a
basic
help.
The
Game
Client
In
the
middle,
you
may
see
featured
high
rating
matches,
the
lastest
news,
newly
released
items
and
game
related
videos.
On
the
bottom,
there
are
your
communication
methods.
The
first
one
is
a
friends
tab,
where
you
can
chat
with
your
friends,
display
a
status
message
and
manage
your
lists.
The
second
one
displays
chat
rooms.
The
last
tab
is
the
notification
center,
where
you
can
manage
your
requests.
The
Store
The
League
of
Legends
Store
allows
summoners
to
purchase
additional
options
through
Riot
Points
(RP)
and
Influence
Points
(IP).
Riot
Points
must
be
bought
using
real
money,
while
Influence
Points
are
earned
by
playing
the
game.
Champions
can
be
unlocked
either
by
spending
RP
or
IP
.
Skins
are
alternate
looks
for
champions
that
can
be
unlocked
by
RP
only,
but
does
not
alter
gameplay.
Boosts
to
IP
and
XP
gain
over
a
period
can
be
purchased
by
RP
only.
Runes
can
be
purchased
by
IP
only.
The
Gifting
Center
can
be
used
to
purchase
champions
and
skins
to
your
mates
using
RP
only.
Summoner's
Profile
Player's
Profile
Important
information
about
your
summoner
can
be
found
here.
It
displays
your
record
of
wins
and
special
benchmarks
as
medals,
that
evolve
as
you
gain
progress.
If
the
summoner
plays
Ranked
games
,
his
most
played
champions
will
also
appear.
Additionaly,
a
small
icon
on
the
right
should
indicate
if
your
First
win
of
the
day
is
available,
which
upon
winning
a
normal
match
grants
a
bonus
of
150
IP.
The
"Leagues"
will
not
show
up
unless
the
summoner
plays
Ranked
games
(those
are
not
available
until
level
30).
Once
a
summoner
choses
the
play
those
games,
his
rating
on
the
ladder
will
appear.
In
the
match
history
tab
you
will
able
to
see
the
10
last
games
that
have
been
played
by
the
summoner.
Information
such
as
which
champion
has
been
played,
score,
game
mode,
items
build
and
so
will
appear.
If
you'd
like
to
learn
a
spacific
summoner
his
history
tab
is
a
good
way
to
start.
Champions
This
tab
will
feature
the
full
champions
list.
Currently,
there
are
118
different
champions,
each
with
unique
characteristics
and
abilities.
Each
champion
is
tagged
with
certain
roles
such
as
'tank',
'fighter',
'mage'
or
'support'
to
describe
their
play
style.
In
a
match,
each
summoner
controls
a
single
champion
from
their
available
pool.
An
owned
champion,
one
that
you
may
summon,
appears
coloured.
At
the
start
you
will
not
have
any
champion,
but
do
not
worry
-
there
is
a
Free
week
Champion
rotation!
Each
week,
beginning
at
Tuesday,
10
unique
champions
will
be
temporaly
unlocked
and
marked
with
a
sign
near
their
portrait.
That
way,
summoners
are
able
to
expirience
champions
they
are
not
familiar
while
not
fully
comitting
to
them.
The
tremendous
amount
of
champions
may
be
a
little
frightning
at
first,
but
the
great
selection
allows
each
summoner
or
player
find
his
own
niche
of
playstyle.
Runes
and
Masteries
Both
of
those
categories
are
ingame
bonuses
that
can
only
be
organized
outside
of
it
-
which
means
that
those
are
mainly
playstyle
and
preference
related.
The
bonuses
may
appear
small
at
first
but
they
stack
up
nicely.
In
a
scanario,
they
may
be
the
difference
between
life
and
death!
Mastery
Tree
Example
Runes
This
system
is
a
little
bit
more
difficult
to
fully
optimize.
Runes
are
generally
categorized
into
Marks
(offensive),
Seals
(defensive),
Glyphs
(utility)
and
Quintessence
(all-purpose).
They
are
also
grouped
into
3
tiers
of
power
ordered
by
the
summoner's
level.
Runes
can
be
unlocked
with
Influence
Points
only
in
the
Store,
and
must
be
placed
in
the
Runebook
in
order
to
be
beneficial.
The
Runebook
has
limited
number
of
slots
for
each
rune
type.
The
book
has
two
pages,
though
more
can
be
purchased,
allowing
several
different
rune
setups
to
be
available.It
is
generally
recomended
to
avoid
purchasing
runes
at
all
until
you
are
more
familliar
with
the
game,
else
they
may
turn
up
as
a
waste
of
points.
Masteries
The
perks
related
system
is
grouped
into
three
catagories:
Offensive,
Defensive
and
Utility.
You
gain
one
point
per
level,
which
eventually
stack
up
into
30
points.
Masteries
can
be
re-distributed
freely
in
your
summoner
profile
and
during
champion
selection,
so
do
not
fear
a
single
point
mistake.
Spells
Summoner
spells
are
powerful
abilities
that
can
be
used
ingame
without
a
relation
to
your
played
champion.
They
are
unlocked
at
certain
levels,
even
though
it
does
not
hints
their
power.
You
may
pick
your
spells
only
during
champion
selection,
so
choose
carefully.
Ingame,
those
spells
carry
a
high
cooldown,
but
powerful
abilities
since
the
champion
normally
does
not
carry
those.
Item
Sets
You
may
configue
those
if
you
find
yourself
using
a
unique
build
alot,
and
would
like
to
have
it
ordered.
Not
much
to
explain,
really.
Gameplay
Before
the
flood
of
information
begins,
each
summoner
needs
to
understand
that
each
every
match
starts
from
a
scratch,
and
the
result
of
one
will
not
effect
the
next
or
the
previous
one.
Starting
a
Game
In
the
client,
press
the
red
'Play'
button
and
select
your
desired
game
type.
There
are
quite
a
lot
modes
to
pick
from,
but
it
is
recomended
to
stick
to
classic
Co-op
vs
AI
5v5
Beginner
matches
until
you
get
a
good
grip
of
the
game
.
As
you
get
into
the
game
queue,
the
matchmaking
system
will
look
for
other
people
in
order
to
get
enough
players.
When
a
match
will
be
found,
accept
it
in
order
to
get
into
champion
selection
.
Champion
Selection
On
this
screen,
a
summoner
is
able
to
pick
his
game
setup.
This
includes
his
champion,
summoner
spells,
runes
and
masteries.
After
one
is
satisfied
with
his
pick,
he
may
lock
in.
Once
a
pick
has
been
locked,
he
can
no
longer
change
his
champion,
but
he
may
keep
changing
the
other
tabs
and
skins
(if
owned).
Champion
Selection
The
selection
screen
is
split
into
three
parts:
On
the
edges,
there
are
the
summoners
from
each
team.
There,
it
is
able
to
see
your
team
champions
and
spells
picks,
but
not
the
enemy
team
ones.
Once
a
summoner
locks
in
his
area
will
gray
out.
In
the
middle,
there
are
the
selections.
The
summoner's
champion
pool
is
displayed
on
the
top,
while
the
scale
below
shows
the
other
choices,
together
with
the
'Lock
In'
button.
The
chat
is
displayed
at
the
bottom.
There,
a
summoner
can
chat
with
his
team
before
the
match
starts.
Common
uses
include
calling
out
roles,
discussing
a
strategy
about
the
upcoming
game
or
just
chatting
for
fun.
After
everyone
is
ready,
the
selections
window
will
close
and
the
loading
screen
will
open.
There
you
will
be
able
to
see
your
enemies
names,
champions
and
summoner
spells,
and
a
loading
progress.
Once
everyone
finishes
to
load,
the
match
starts.
Match
Progress
The
goal
of
each
match
is
to
destory
the
opposing
team's
Nexus.
It
is
done
(exept
in
the
Dominion
game
mode)
by
destroying
the
previous
buildings
in
that
base.
Summoner's
Rift
An
example
is
provided
on
the
map
called
"Summoner's
rift".
It
countains
two
bases
in
opposite
edges
of
the
map.
There
are
three
lanes
connecting
those
bases,
and
an
area
called
"The
Jungle"
in
between
them.
Every
thirty
seconds
a
wave
of
minions
will
advance
down
those
three
lanes
until
they
each
an
enemy.
In
each
lane
there
are
three
turrets
for
each
side
-
powerful
defensive
structures
that
hit
close
enemies.
To
advance
further
down
the
lane,
the
most
outer
turret
must
be
destoryed.
After
the
third
turret,
each
lane
contains
an
inhibitor,
which
upon
its
destuction
summons
more
powerful
minions
down
that
lane.
After
five
minutes
a
broken
inhibitor
will
respawn,
and
the
stronger
minions
will
stop
spawning.
While
an
inhibtor
is
down,
the
Nexus
turrets
can
be
accessed,
and
upon
their
destruction
to
eventually
be
able
to
take
down
the
Nexus
and
win
the
game.
In
game
"Laning"
"Laning"
is
a
phrase
commonly
referring
to
the
starting
phase
of
the
game.
The
laning
phase
consists
of
one
to
two
members
selecting
a
"lane"
(the
pre-scripted
path
where
your
AI
controlled
minions
path)
in
order
to
maximize
experience
gain
among
the
team.
During
the
laning
phase
players
usually
focus
on
gaining
gold
and
experience
through
creep
kills
and
slaying
enemy
champions.
The
laning
phase
is
considered
over
when
the
outer
turret
of
either
team
is
taken,
as
it
becomes
dangerous
to
venture
("push")
farther
into
enemy
territory.
It
is
at
this
time
that
it
is
generally
considered
beneficial
to
meet
up
with
the
rest
of
your
team
and
help
take
their
outer
turrets.
During
the
initial
laning
phase,
champions
often
use
the
brush
to
deceive
players
into
feeling
safe.
Curious
players
often
wander
into
brush
to
check
for
opposing
champions.
This
can
be
dangerous
and
is
not
recommended
unless
you
are
willing
to
blow
defensive
summoner
spells
to
survive
a
worst
case
scenario.
Alternatively,
Clairvoyance
can
be
used
to
check
the
brush
without
putting
yourself
in
danger.
Gaining
first
blood
is
a
strong
benefit
to
any
champion
as
it's
worth
in
gold
is
almost
that
of
two
champion
kills.
To
maximize
your
chances
of
gaining
first
blood
it
is
usually
beneficial
to
balance
your
lanes
out
(using
Summoner's
Rift
as
a
reference).
If
the
option
presents
itself,
it
is
strongly
recommended
that
you
ensure
each
lane
has
a
ranged
champion.
Ranged
champions
can
freely
harass
melee
champions
to
prevent
them
from
attacking
creeps
to
gain
gold.
In
general,
melee
champions
are
required
to
put
themselves
in
compromising
positions
when
they
go
in
for
creep
kills,
leaving
them
open
to
attacks
from
the
enemy
team.
Displacement
(
Rocket
Grab
,
Fling
)
and
stun
(
Cryptic
Gaze
,
Gold
Card
)
skills
are
invaluable
during
the
laning
phase
due
to
the
widespread
use
of
flash
and
the
relatively
narrow
distance
between
the
initial
two
towers.
With
the
lack
of
any
stun
or
displacement
your
only
hope
for
getting
a
kill
during
the
laning
phase
is
that
the
other
team
overextends
and
leaves
themselves
compromised
enough
for
you
to
take
advantage.
It
is
highly
recommended
that
newer
players
take
high
regen/survivability
starting
items
to
help
them
stay
in
the
lane
and
maximize
gold/experience
gained
during
this
phase.
Items
like
this
include
Doran's
Shield
,
Rejuvenation
Bead
and
.
Because
of
the
increase
in
the
values
of
mana
regen
in
League
of
Legends
in
relation
to
other
MOBAs,
it
is
often
recommended
that
ranged
champions/mages
pick
up
mana
regen
(
Faerie
Charm
to
let
them
cast
spells
more
freely.
Regardless
of
your
item
purchases,
if
you
can
afford
a
potion
when
you
leave
the
base
you
should
definitely
bring
one
along.
The
alternative
to
laning
is
jungling
,
where
a
champion
avoids
the
scripted
AI
paths
and
kills
neutral
monsters
in
either
their
own
or
the
opponents'
jungle.
"Ganking"
Ganking
is
the
term
used
when
a
group
of
champions
ambush
enemy
champions.
Ganks
are
usually
orchestrated
in
brush
as
the
laning
champions
let
the
enemies
push
further
from
their
own
turret,
thus
giving
the
enemies
more
distance
to
cover
for
an
escape.
Junglers
tend
to
use
ganking
to
their
advantage
because
of
their
non-stop
movement.
After
a
turret
is
taken
down,
the
champions
that
took
out
the
turret
commonly
begin
ganking
other
lanes;
because
sometimes,
it
is
too
dangerous
to
push
to
the
next
turret.
If
the
champions
were
to
push
the
lane
anyway,
they
would
need
the
durability
and
escape
mechanisms
to
survive
a
potential
gank.
Minions
Main
article:
Minion
"Minions"
refers
to
the
expendable
units
that
each
Nexus
spawns
and
sends
towards
the
enemy.
They
move
on
predetermined
paths,
and
have
the
singular
goal
of
destroying
the
nearest
enemy
minion,
Tower
,
Inhibitor
and
Nexus.
Correct
utilization
of
both
your
opponents'
minions
and
your
own
is
a
major
key
to
victory.
Minions
primarily
serve
as
your
main
source
of
Experience.
Every
enemy
minion
that
dies
will
reward
all
nearby
champions
with
a
set
amount
of
experience,
split
evenly
amongst
all
allied
champions
in
the
area.
Due
to
the
fact
that
the
experience
is
split
amongst
champions,
it
is
advantageous
to
have
champions
split
between
all
the
lanes,
so
that
they
all
receive
experience
at
a
decent
rate
and
do
not
become
underleveled
as
time
goes
on.
In
addition
to
experience,
enemy
Minions
can
provide
a
large
amount
of
Gold
to
champions.
Every
time
a
champion
slays
a
minion
by
landing
the
"Last
Hit,"
they
will
receive
a
small
amount
of
gold,
the
amount
of
which
is
determined
by
the
type
of
minion
slain
and
the
amount
of
time
the
match
has
gone
on.
If
you
carefully
time
your
abilities
and
attacks
in
order
to
gain
this
gold,
you
can
quickly
afford
powerful
items
from
the
shop.
Finally,
one
should
utilize
their
own
minions
in
order
to
further
their
own
team
objectives.
While
individually,
a
minion
cannot
accomplish
very
much,
their
numbers
are
great
enough
that
when
a
champion
helps
them
to
"Push"
to
an
enemy
Structure,
they
can
both
deal
a
respectable
amount
of
damage.
In
the
laning
phase,
minions
can
also
deal
a
decent
amount
of
damage
to
enemy
champions,
but
since
there
is
currently
no
way
to
issue
orders
directly
to
minions,
they
aren't
likely
to
directly
attack
your
foe
unless
provoked
or
left
with
no
other
target.
Jungling
Main
article:
Jungling
In
addition
to
each
teams
minions,
there
are
a
variety
of
neutral
monsters
that
spawn
in
each
teams'
jungle
area.
These
monsters
can
be
slain
for
gold
and
experience,
and
several
of
the
more
powerful
monsters
can
be
slain
in
order
to
gain
beneficial
buffs.
Additionally,
Vilemaw
,
Dragon
,
and
Baron
Nashor
can
be
slain
to
grant
rewards
to
the
entire
team.
Naturally,
making
use
of
the
buffs,
gold,
and
experience
available
in
your
team's
jungle
is
beneficial
and
can
be
a
deciding
factor
in
the
outcome
of
the
match.
There
are
several
ways
to
harvest
these
rewards
for
your
team,
but
one
of
the
most
effective
methods
is
to
have
a
dedicated
jungler
who
will
spend
the
early
game
roaming
about
through
the
jungle
and
killing
the
monsters
within.
As
this
player
will
be
spending
much
of
his
early
time
battling
the
statistically
powerful
neutral
creeps,
it
is
often
recommended
that
a
new
player
save
learning
to
jungle
for
later
once
some
runes
and
mastery
points
have
been
acquired.

jungling

Turrets
Main
article:
Turret
Turrets,
occasionally
referred
to
as
Towers,
are
the
main
means
of
defense
for
each
team's
Nexus.
They
possess
a
high
amount
of
health,
armor,
magic
resist,
attack
damage,
and
are
untargetable
by
many
spells.
Knowing
this,
it
is
best
not
to
try
to
attack
one
by
yourself.
Due
to
the
high
strength
of
towers,
they
also
provide
a
relative
safety-net
from
your
foes.
In
order
to
reach
the
enemy's
nexus,
at
least
one
lane's
towers
must
be
completely
destroyed,
as
well
as
the
two
Nexus
Turrets.
Destroying
enemy
towers
is
one
of
the
main
goals
of
the
early
phase
of
the
game,
and
that
goal
becomes
more
prominent
as
time
goes
on.
Successfully
destroying
a
turret
early
on
can
be
a
very
powerful
move,
as
it
will
not
only
move
you
closer
to
the
enemy
nexus,
but
it
will
remove
your
foe's
vision
and
map
control
for
that
area,
and
reward
every
member
of
your
team,
regardless
of
position
or
state,
with
150
gold.
In
general,
the
best
way
to
destroy
a
tower
is
to
clear
out
the
enemy
minions
in
a
lane
while
you
still
have
yours,
and
then
have
both
you
and
your
minions
attack
the
tower,
while
the
minions
take
the
shots
for
you.
Certain
champions
possess
special
abilities
that
help
them
to
push
lanes
(
Heimerdinger
or
Singed
,
for
example)
while
others
possess
strong
abilities
which
allow
them
to
deal
heavy
damage
to
towers
(
Nasus
or
Master
Yi
,
for
example).
While
it
is
certainly
not
necessary
to
have
champions
like
these
on
your
team,
if
you
intend
to
have
a
strategy
which
revolves
around
pushing
lanes,
this
can
be
beneficial.
Inhibitors
Main
article:
Inhibitor
Inhibitors
serve
as
a
secondary
defense
for
each
team's
Nexus.
When
an
opponent's
inhibitor
has
been
destroyed,
your
team
will
spawn
a
Super
Minion
in
each
minion
wave
for
that
lane.
These
Super
Minions
have
dramatically
increased
health,
armor,
and
damage,
and
almost
guarantee
that
a
lane
will
push
further,
or
at
least
occupy
one
or
more
of
the
enemy
team's
champions.
Inhibitors
cannot
be
damaged
until
all
the
turrets
in
it's
lane
have
been
destroyed,
so
it
can
be
considered
a
"Last
Defense"
of
sorts.
However,
the
inhibitor
itself
has
no
armor
or
magic
resist
and
does
not
deal
damage,
so
it
is
significantly
easier
to
destroy
without
the
help
of
a
large
minion
wave.
This
being
said,
the
inhibitor
regenerates
it's
health
over
time,
so
it
is
often
necessary
to
fully
commit
to
destroying
it
when
the
chance
is
available.
Finally,
the
inhibitor
is
the
only
structure
in
the
game
which
can
respawn
once
it's
health
has
been
depleted.
So
do
your
best
to
make
additional
progress
after
it
has
been
destroyed,
or
the
enemy
team
may
be
able
to
defend
it
long
enough
to
prevent
any
additional
damage
to
their
base.
Nexus
Main
article:
Nexus
The
Nexus
is
the
giant
floating
crystal
in
center
of
each
team's
base,
located
just
in
front
of
the
summoning
circle.
The
goal
of
each
match
is
to
destroy
your
opponent's
nexus
while
protecting
your
own.
In
the
Classic
game
mode,
destroying
the
enemy
team's
nexus
first
requires
the
destruction
of
an
entire
lane
of
Turrets
and
Inhibitor,
and
the
additional
Nexus
Turrets.
After
this
has
been
accomplished,
as
long
as
one
inhibitor
is
down,
the
Nexus
itself
can
be
attacked.
When
you
have
reduce
your
enemy's
nexus
to
zero,
the
game
will
be
over,
and
you
shall
be
declared
victorious.
The
Nexus
does,
however,
regenerate
health
over
time,
and
because
it
is
directly
next
to
your
foe's
Summoning
Circle,
they
will
almost
always
be
able
to
defend
it
quickly,
so
it
is
best
to
either
have
a
very
large
minion
and
superminion
wave
present,
or
to
have
multiple
members
of
your
team
there
attacking
it.
Keep
in
mind
that
harassing
opponents
around
their
Nexus
will
be
largely
ineffective,
as
they
will
most
likely
be
able
to
walk
into
their
Summoning
Circle
to
heal,
so
do
your
best
to
direct
all
attention
to
the
Nexus
itself
if
you
desire
a
speedy
victory.
In
the
Dominion
game
mode,
each
team's
Nexus
is
untargetable
by
the
opposing
team
at
all
times.
Instead,
the
enemy
team's
nexus
takes
damage
when
certain
conditions
are
met,
most
notably,
when
you
control
of
more
Capture
Points
than
your
opponent.
The
more
of
the
5
points
on
the
map
that
you
can
control,
the
faster
your
opponent's
nexus
will
take
damage,
though
if
both
teams
hold
an
equal
number
of
points,
neither
nexus
will
take
damage.
In
both
game
modes,
destroying
the
enemy's
nexus
requires
cooperation
and
coordination
from
the
whole
team,
and
at
times,
sacrifices.
If
your
death
has
brought
your
team
inevitably
closer
to
victory,
feel
free
to
inform
your
foes
that
it
was
"Worth
it."
