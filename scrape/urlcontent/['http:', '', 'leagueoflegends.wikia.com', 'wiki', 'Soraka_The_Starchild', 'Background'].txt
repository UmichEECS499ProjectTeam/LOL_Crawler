A
healer
gifted
with
the
magic
of
the
stars,
Soraka
holds
all
living
creatures
close
to
her
heart.
She
was
once
a
celestial
being,
but
she
sacrificed
her
immortality
and
entered
the
world
of
mortals.
So
long
as
evil
threatens
life
in
Valoran
,
Soraka
will
not
allow
herself
peace.
Soraka
lived
for
centuries
in
an
enchanted
grove.
A
being
of
the
stars,
she
healed
the
wounded
and
sick
that
sought
her
out.
One
man
called
Warwick
came
to
her
grove
and
begged
her
to
heal
his
wife,
who
lay
lifeless
in
his
arms.
His
despair
touched
Soraka's
heart.
Though
it
was
too
late
to
save
his
wife,
she
offered
to
help
heal
the
pain
of
his
loss.
Unwilling
to
let
go
of
his
grief
Warwick
ran
from
the
grove,
but
returned
over
the
following
days
to
hear
Soraka's
guidance.
She
began
to
grow
attached
to
the
grieving
man.
One
day
Warwick
told
her
he
had
found
the
men
who
killed
his
wife.
He
believed
revenge
would
heal
his
pain
–
and
if
he
died
fighting,
he
would
at
least
find
peace.
Though
she
pleaded
with
him,
Warwick
ignored
her
and
left
the
grove.
The
voices
of
the
stars
warned
her
not
to
follow
him,
but
Soraka
had
to
intervene.
She
stepped
into
the
mortal
world
for
the
first
time,
and
soon
found
Warwick
desperately
fighting
a
group
of
men.
She
tried
to
heal
him,
but
for
every
wound
she
closed,
the
men
inflicted
two
more.
Soraka
realized
that
she
would
have
to
fight
to
save
her
friend.
The
stars
screamed
in
her
mind,
telling
her
not
to
use
her
powers
for
harm.
Ignoring
their
warning,
she
struck
the
attackers
with
a
flash
of
brilliant
light.
Crying
out
in
terror
and
shielding
their
eyes
from
her
divine
radiance,
they
fled.
Soraka's
celestial
form
faded
and
the
stars
fell
silent
–
for
her
transgression,
she
became
mortal.
She
still
felt
the
power
of
the
stars
within
her,
but
they
no
longer
offered
her
guidance.
She
took
comfort
in
Warwick's
safety,
gently
healing
his
wounds,
but
the
man
she
had
called
her
friend
slipped
a
dagger
between
her
ribs.
As
her
blood
spilled,
Soraka
realized
he
had
fooled
her,
and
everything
he
had
done
was
a
complicated
ruse.
Feeling
humiliated
and
betrayed
she
called
once
more
on
the
power
of
the
stars,
searing
his
flesh
and
cursing
his
cruelty.
He
retreated
with
an
agonized
howl,
leaving
Soraka
to
reflect
upon
her
fate.
Though
her
life
had
changed,
she
felt
empowered
and
renewed
with
a
singular
purpose.
No
longer
bound
to
the
grove,
Soraka
set
out
into
the
mortal
world,
vowing
to
heal
the
wounded
and
protect
the
helpless.
"The
cruelty
of
one
will
not
blind
me
to
the
suffering
of
many."
―
Soraka
Soraka's
lore
was
officially
updated
on
September
18
th
,
2012
.
[1]
Soraka,
the
Starchild
of
Ionia
,
was
the
first
of
her
kind.
While
there
are
many
who
tap
into
the
rich
magical
energies
of
Valoran
,
she
was
the
first
to
tap
into
the
magic
of
the
cosmos
itself
–
the
celestial
sea
in
which
it
is
theorized
that
Runeterra
swims
among
other
like
bodies.
While
Runeterran
magicians
are
limited
by
the
finite
(though
tremendous)
powers
of
runes,
there
have
always
been
those
who
have
searched
to
go
further.
Reaching
beyond
the
terrestrial
firmament
of
Runeterra,
Soraka
was
capable
of
invoking
the
power
of
the
stars,
evolving
beyond
her
kin.
This
power
has
changed
her
in
fantastical
ways
–
it
is
for
this
reason
that
she
became
known
as
the
Starchild.
Though
Soraka
was
once
trans-human,
Soraka
has
fallen
since
she
let
the
most
primal
of
emotions
rule
her.
Warwick
,
a
mercenary
chemist
in
the
service
of
Noxus
,
had
caused
untold
suffering
and
death
among
Soraka's
people.
An
alchemical
genius
who
took
no
responsibility
for
the
atrocities
he'd
caused,
Warwick
became
known
as
"the
Deathmaker"
by
the
Ionian
people.
As
Noxian
murder
and
terror
pushed
ever-forward
across
her
land,
unstoppable
anger
and
hatred
welled
within
Soraka.
She
called
down
the
power
of
the
heavens
to
curse
and
forever
change
the
Deathmaker,
and
she
mutated
the
man
into
a
werewolf
–
a
wild,
murderous
beast.
For
this
misstep,
Soraka
lost
much
of
her
power,
sacrificing
her
trans-human
ascension
and
sliding
several
steps
down
the
evolutionary
ladder
in
an
instant.
Though
she
is
still
a
champion
of
the
Ionian
people,
Soraka
has
joined
the
League
of
Legends
in
hopes
of
reversing
her
curse
and
redeeming
herself
in
the
eyes
of
the
stars.
"Though
having
fallen
from
grace,
Soraka
is
nonetheless
determined
to
once
again
be
one
with
the
stars."

before
readying
for
her
return
to
