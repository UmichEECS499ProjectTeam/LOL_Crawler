The
health
bar,
colored
green,
on
top,
and
the
Mana
bar,
colored
blue,
on
the
bottom.
Mana
is
the
resource
of
some
champions
necessary
to
cast
most
of
his/her
abilities
.
The
mana
pool
is
represented
by
a
blue
bar
below
the
green
health
bar
and
two
numbers
(
#
/
#
)
in
the
middle
of
it.
The
first
one
is
your
current
amount
of
mana
and
the
second
refers
to
the
maximum
amount
you
can
store.
Mana
regenerates
over
time
and
this
rate
can
be
increased
with
masteries
and
items
.
At
level
18,
the
base
mana
pool
ranges
from
Poppy's
725
to
Janna's
1454.
