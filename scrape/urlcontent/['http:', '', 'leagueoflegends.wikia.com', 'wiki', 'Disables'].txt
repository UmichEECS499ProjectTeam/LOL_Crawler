Crowd
control
(
CC
)
is
the
term
used
to
describe
an
ability
or
spell
that
temporarily
reduces
a
unit's
ability
to
fight.
The
term
'crowd
control'
comes
from
the
ability
to
control
the
enemy
team
during
fights,
by
either
restricting
their
contribution
or
means
to
escape.
In
addition,
the
use
of
crowd
control
can
aid
in
your
own
survivability:
in
the
same
way
you
can
stop
them
from
escaping,
you
can
stop
them
from
following.
Crowd
control
does
not
make
an
enemy
untargetable
.
In
the
case
of
Airborne
effects,
the
target
is
considered
to
be
on
the
ground
for
the
purposes
of
skill
shots
and
area
of
effect
damage
(such
as
Morgana's
Tormented
Soil
).

Control
.
The
following
are
the
current
forms
of
crowd
control
that
exist
within
League

Airborne
:
A
unit
that
is
airborne
is
unable
to
control
its
movement,
attack
or
cast
abilities
for
the
duration.
The
duration
is
also
unaffected
by
crowd
control
reduction
and
cannot
be
removed
by
cleansing
effects.
Knockback
:
A
knockback
causes
the
target
to
be
made
airborne
in
a
direction
away
from
the
point
of
cast.The
duration
depends
on
how
far
the
target
travels,
from

seconds
(
Rammus's
Powerball
)
to
1.
5
(
Lulu's
Wild
Growth

Knockup
:
A
knockup
causes
the
target
to
be
made
airborne
on
the
spot.

duration
depends
on
how
high
is
the
target
thrown
into
the
air,
from
0.
75
seconds
(
Rammus's
Powerball
)
to
1.
5
(
Lulu's
Wild
Growth
).
Pull/Fling

A
pull
effect
causes
the
target
to
be
made
airborne
in
a
direction
toward
the
point
of
cast.
Blind
:
A
unit
that
is
blinded
will
miss
its
auto-attacks
for
the
duration.

:
A
unit
that
is
entangled
is
unable
to
control
its
movement
or
attack
for
the
duration.
Forced
Action
:
A
unit
that
is
under
the
effect
of
a
forced
action
cannot
control
its
own
movement
or
attacks,
and
is
unable
to
cast
abilities.
Charm
:
A
unit
that
is
charmed
will
move
toward
the
source
for
the
duration.

:
A
unit

will
walk
directly
away
from
the
source
of
the
fear
while
having
reduced
movement
speed
for
the
duration.
Flee
:
Targeted
unit
will
move
away
from
the
attacker.
[1]

unit
that
is
taunted
will
attempt
to
attack
the
source
of
the
taunt
for
the
duration.
Polymorph
:
A
unit
that
is
pacified
cannot
attack
or
cast
abilities
and
has
reduced
movement
speed
for
the
duration.
Root
:
A
unit
that
is
rooted
is
unable
to
control
its
movement
for
the
duration
(occasionally
referred
to
as
a

Silence
:
A
unit
that
is
silenced
cannot
cast
abilities
or

reduced
movement
speed
for
the
duration.

:
A
unit
that
is
stunned
is
unable
to
move,
attack
or
cast
abilities
for
the
duration.
Suspended
:
A
unit
that
is
suspended
is
considered
to
be
airborne
for
the
purposes
of
Last
Breath
,
but
for
countering
purposes
it's
considered
a
stun.
Suppression
:
A
unit
that
is
suppressed
is
unable
to
control
its
movement,
attack,
cast
abilities
or
use
spells

Please
note
the
following:
Movement
includes
abilities
(such
as
Ezreal's
Arcane
Shift
).
For
example,
while
airborne
you
can
cast
all
summoner
spells
except
Flash
and
Teleport
.
Ability
refers
to
a
champion's
castable
spells
(by
default
Q,
W,
E
and
R).
Mikael's
Crucible
cannot
be
activated
where
Abilities
are
disabled,
as
the
item
is
intended
to
be
used
on
allies.
Spells
refers
to
the
Summoner
Spells
.
Interrupt
refers
to
whether
or
not
the
effect
will
cancel
channeled
abilities.
Contrary
to
popular
belief,
Roots
and
Entangles
will
NOT
interrupt
channeling
.
This
is
with
the
exception
of
two
special-cases:
Teleport
and
Shen's
Stand
United
.
Roots
and
Entangles
will,
however,
interrupt
charged
abilities
(namely
Elastic
Slingshot
,
Vault
Breaker
and
Piercing
Arrow
).
Mercurial
Scimitar
removes
any
crowd
control
effect
that
Quicksilver
Sash
would.
Categorization
Loss
of
Control
Crowd
control
is
often
categorized
into
two
categories
depending
on
whether
or
not
the
effect
removes
total
control
of
the
player's
character.

following
effects

remove
control
of
one's

remove
partial

of
one's
character:

Disruption
As
an
alternative
to
the
above,
crowd
control
is
sometimes
categorized
into
two
categories
depending
on
whether
or
not
the
effect
disrupts
the

of
an
ability;
abilities
such
as
Karthus's
Requiem
and
Katarina's
Death
Lotus
.

Self-CC
The
following
effects
are
comparable
to
crowd
control,
except
that
the
effect
is
caused
voluntarily
and
affects
the
user
rather
than
a
target.
Self-Knockback:
A
champion
that
knockbacks
itself
and
is
temporarily
unable
to
attack
and
issue
movement
commands.
The
target
may
still
cast
spells.
Caitlyn's
90
Caliber
Net
Ziggs's
Satchel
Charge
Self-Root:
A
champion
that
roots
itself
is
unable
to
control
its
movement
and
will
ignore
movement
commands
(included
forced
actions,
such
as
fear).
A
champion
that
is
rooted
can
still
be
moved
by
airborne
effects,
but
it
will
not
break
the
root.
Vel'Koz's
Lifeform
Disintegration
Ray
Xerath's
Rite
of
the
Arcane
Self-Silence:
A
champion
that
silences
itself
is
unable
to
cast
abilities.
They
may
still
attack
and
use
summoner
spells.
Rumble's
Junkyard
Titan
These
effects
are
not
affected
by
crowd
control
reduction,
nor
can
they
be
removed
by
cleansing
effects.
A
note
on
channeling
and
casting
animations:
neither
are
considered
forms
of
crowd
control,
however
disruptive
they
may
be.
A
notable
example
is
Renekton's
Ruthless
Predator
,
which
incapacitates
Renekton
for
a
fair
duration
of
the
stun
-
much
to
many
player's
detest.
Casting:
The
casting
(sometimes
"charging")
of
an
ability
cannot
be
cancelled
by
the
player
or
an
enemy
except
by
death.
Forced
actions
(such
as
taunt)
will
have
no
effect
for
the
duration
of
the
cast,
and
using
airborne
effects
to
move
the
player
will
not
affect
the
trajectory
of
the
skill
-
which
will
start
from
the
point
of
cast,
not
from
the
player's
current
location.
Summoner
spells
and
most
items
can
still
be
activated
while
casting.
Channeling:
The
channeling
of
an
ability
can
be
cancelled
by
hard
CC,
or
by
the
player
attempting
to
perform
another
action
(such
as
movement,
casting
another
ability
or
attacking)
-
a
notable
exception
is
Galio's
Bulwark
,
which
can
be
cast
during
Idol
of
Durand
without
interrupting
the
channel.
Summoner
spells
and
most
items
can
be
activated
without
disrupting
channeling
(which
is
particularly
useful
information
for
jungle
Fiddlesticks
as
Health
Potions
will
not
interrupt
Drain
).
Self-Slow:
A
champion
that
slows
itself
has
reduced
movement
speed.
Most
of
the
current
examples
are
Garen's
Judgment
(while
passing
through
enemy
units)
Varus's
Piercing
Arrow
Vi's
Vault
Breaker
Xerath's
Arcanopulse
Self-Stun:
The
following
champions
have
channeled
abilities
that
the
summoner
cannot
interrupt
(contrary
to
most
channels
which
will
be
interrupted
if
you
attempt
to
move,
attack
or
use
another
ability).
This
is
comparable
to
a
stun.
Caitlyn's
Ace
in
the
Hole
Malzahar's
Nether
Grasp
(for
the
first
0.
5
seconds
of
the
duration)
Urgot's
Hyper-Kinetic
Position
Reverser
Warwick's
Infinite
Duress
Trivia
Sona's
Crescendo
causes
the
target
to
dance
.
The
highest
continuous
form
of
crowd
control
reduction
can
be
achieved
by
Irelia's
Ionian
Fervor
with
3
nearby
foes,
Tenacity
,
and
Tenacious
for
66.85%.
Tryndamere
is
the
only
champion
in
the
game
that
can
activate
an
ability
while
disabled
that
doesn't
remove
the
disable.
Alistar
,
Gangplank
and
Olaf
also
have
an
ability
that
can
be
activated
while
disabled,
but
these
remove
the
disabling
effects.
