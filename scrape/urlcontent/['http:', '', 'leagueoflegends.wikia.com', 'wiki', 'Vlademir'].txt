Ability
Details
Additional
Information:
While
stated
that
the
bonuses
do
not
stack
with
themselves,
that
is
not
entirely
true.
When
the
bonus
AP
granted
by
Crimson
Pact
interacts
with
ability
power
modifiers,
such
as
Rabadon's
Deathcap
or
Archmage
,
the
bonus
AP
gained
from
those
modifiers
triggers
more
health
from
Crimson
Pact.
This
creates
a
cyclic
loop.
The
same
is
also
true
for
maximum
health
modifiers,
such
as
Juggernaut
.
Rabadon's
Deathcap
increases
Vladimir's
bonus
health
by
1.
05
%.
Wooglet's
Witchcap
increases
Vladimir's
bonus
health
by

Ability
Details
Transfusion
is
a
single
target
ability
that
deals
magic
damage
to
a
target
enemy
unit.
A
mist
of
blood
travels
back
to
Vladimir
afterwards,
healing
him
upon
return.

Black
Shield
and

.
Spell
shields
will
block
the
damage
but
will
not
prevent
the
healing
Additional
Information:
The
spell
has
a
0.25
second
cast
time.
The
healing
effect
of
Transfusion
does
not
occur
until
the
projectile
returns
to
Vladimir.
If
Vladimir
has
any
Spell
vamp
he
will
be
healed
instantly,
not
waiting
for
the
particle
to
return.
He
will
be
then
healed
by
the
particle
as
it
arrives.
If
Vladimir
uses
Sanguine
Pool
or
Stasis
item
immediately
after
Transfusion
or
the
target
is
behind
Wind
Wall
,
the
healing
projectile
will
fizzle
and
Vladimir
will
not
be
healed.

Ability
Details
Sanguine
Pool
is
a
self-targeted
point
blank
area
of
effect
ability
that
turns
Vladimir
into
a
pool
of
blood
for
2
seconds,
making
him
untargetable
for
the
duration.
While
Sanguine
Pool
is
active,
enemy
units
nearby
Vladimir
take
magic
damage
every
half
second
and
are
slowed,
with
Vladimir
healing
for
a
percentage
of
the
damage
dealt.
The
damage
begins
immediately,
so
the
final
tick
of
damage
occurs
0.5
seconds
before
he
comes
out
of
pool.
The
slow
ends
immediately
once
the
enemy
unit
steps
off
the
pool.
Applies
spell
effects
as
an
area
of
effect
ability.
Spell
vamp
is
reduced
to
one-third
effectiveness.
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
will
apply
a
15%
slow.
Magic
damage
will
be
mitigated
by
Black
Shield
and
Lifeline
.
Spell
shields
will
not
block
damage
Additional
Information:
Sanguine
Pool
has
no
cast
time.
Sanguine
Pool
also
scales
with
0.21
per
ability
power
due
to
his
passive.
(which
is
0.0525
per
ability
power
every
half
second.)
While
using
Sanguine
Pool,
Vladimir
cannot
autoattack
,
use
his
other
abilities
,
use
summoner
spells
,
or
activate
items
.
One
exception
is
Quicksilver
Sash
,
which
can
be
activated
while
using
Sanguine
Pool.
Even
though
not
stated
in
the
tooltip,
Sanguine
Pool
also
gives
Vladimir
a
37.
5
%
movement
speed
boost
for
1
second
upon
activating
the
ability.
The
boost
decays
exponentially
over
that
time.
Some
abilities
such
as
Cho'Gath's
Feral
Scream
and
Cassiopeia's
Petrifying
Gaze
can
still
affect
Vladimir
as
he
enters
Sanguine
Pool.
He
will
take
damage
and
crowd
control
effects,
but
Sanguine
Pool
will
still
take
effect
regardless.
Vladimir
is
still
affected
by
damage
over
time
effects
(like
Ignite
and
Swain's
Torment
)
that
were
applied
before
going
into
Sanguine
Pool.
Vladimir
is
untargetable
by
allied
abilities
during
the
duration,
such
as
Janna's
Monsoon
and
Sona's
Aria
of
Perseverance
.
Soraka's
Wish
will
still
heal
him,
because
it
will
affect
untargetable
allies.
Vladimir
is
not
healed
by
the
allied
fountain
while
in
his
pool.
When
Vladimir
uses
Sanguine
Pool
he
is
not
affected
by
any
auras
,
such
as
Abyssal
Scepter's
aura
or
Tailwind
.
Vladimir
cannot
use
Sanguine
Pool
to
pass
through
temporary
terrain
created
by
abilities
such
as
Anivia's
Crystallize
,
Jarvan
IV's
Cataclysm
,
or
Trundle's
Pillar
of
Ice
.
When
in
Sanguine
Pool,
Vladimir
is
still
stunned
when
passing
through
Veigar's
Event
Horizon
.
If
he
does
this,
he
will
remain
in
his
pool
for
its
duration
and
remain
stunned
when
coming
out
of
the
pool
form,
if
the
stun
has
not
expired.

Additional
Information:
Tides
of
Blood
can
be
activated
even
if
there
are
no
valid
targets
in
range.
Vladimir
will
still
gain
a
stack
of
the
Empowered
buff.
The
spell
has
a
0.25
second
cast
time.
Tides
of
Blood
can
target
and
hit
enemy
champions
that
are
not
visible
to
Vladimir,
including
those
in
Fog
of
War,
in
brush
or
in
stealth.
The
Empowered
buff
increases
the
effectiveness
of
Transfusion
,
Sanguine
Pool
healing
effect,
allied
champions'
heals
,
Vladimir's
health
regeneration
,
and
Heal
.
However,
it
does
not
benefit
life
steal
or
spell
vamp
.
The
Empowered
buff
stacks
with
Spirit
Visage's
passive
ability
multiplicatively.
The
Empowered
buff
does
not
affect
bonus
ability
power
damage
on
Tides
of
Blood
in
any
way.
Tides
of
Blood
can
hit
out
of
range
enemies
due
to
the
length
of
the
animation.
When
Vladimir
is
moving
away
from
the
enemy
and
presses
E
at
the
edge,
Tides
of
Blood
will
hit
the
enemy
about
50
extra
units
away.

Vladimir
infects
all
enemies
in
the
target
175-radius
area
with
a
virulent
plague
which
increases
the
damage
they
take
from
all
sources
by
12%
for
5
seconds.
After
these
5
seconds,
infected
enemies
take
magic
damage.

Ability
Details
Hemoplague
is
a
ground
targeted
area
of
effect
ability
that
debuffs
enemy
units
in
the
target
location
for
5
seconds.
Debuffed
units
have
all
incoming
damage
amplified,
and
upon
debuff
expiration
they
take
magic
damage.
Applies
spell
effects
as
an
area
of
effect
ability.
Spell
vamp
is
reduced
to
one-third
effectiveness.
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
will
apply
a
15%
slow.
Magic
damage
will
be
mitigated
by
Black
Shield
and
Lifeline
.
Spell
shields
will
block
debuff,
preventing
damage
Additional
Information:
Hemoplague's
amplification
applies
to
its
own
damage,
meaning
that
the
effective
damage
and
scaling
are
168
/
280
/
392
(+
78.4%
AP)
.
Hemoplague
has
no
cast
time
and
affects
the
target
area
instantly.
However,
there
is
a
0.
5
second
animation
time
that
prevents
Vladimir
from
using
Transfusion
and
Tides
of
Blood.
Sanguine
Pool,
summoner
spells,
and
items
can
be
used
during
this
suppression
time.
Hemoplague
will
amplify
almost
all
sources
and
types
of
damage,
including
damage
from
neutral
monsters.
Only
true
damage
is
exempt
from
amplification.
Hemoplague's
bonus
and
damage
dealt
stacks
multiplicatively
with
Deathfire
Grasp
on
magic
damage,
resulting
in
34.4%
increased
damage.
Other
percent
damage
modifiers
also
stack
multiplicately,
such
as
Havoc.
Casting
Hemoplague
on
a
recalling
enemy
will
not
cancel
the
recall,
because
the
damage
is
delayed.
