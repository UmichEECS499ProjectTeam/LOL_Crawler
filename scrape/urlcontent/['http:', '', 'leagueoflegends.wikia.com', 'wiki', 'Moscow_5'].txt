Bio
Founded
in
2001,
Moscow
Five
is
a
Russian
eSports
organization
with
roots
in
Counter-Strike
1.6,
WarCraft
3,
FIFA,
and
Dota.
In
December
2011,
Moscow
Five
recruited
the
players
of
Team
Empire
who
qualified
to
compete
in
IEM
Kiev.
Moscow
5's
first
major
appearance
would
be
at
the
IEM
Season
VI
-
Global
Challenge
Kiev
on
January
19th,
2012.
It
would
be
here
that
Moscow
5
would
make
a
name
for
themselves
internationally,
as
they
had
little
fame
prior
to
IEM
Kiev.
They
would
then
proceed
to
qualify
for
the
season
2
world
champions
months
later,
and
would
eventually
fall
to
Taipei
Assassins,
taking
home
a
3-4th
place
finish.
Following
the
season
2
WCS,
the
organization
Moscow
5
would
run
into
some
financial
problems,
and
would
release
their
League
team.
The
now
former
Moscow
5
was
picked
up
by
the
organization
"Gambit
Gaming",
keeping
the
old
roster
of
Darien,
Diamond,
Alex,
Genja,
and
Edward.
They
would
then
proceed
to
nearly
get
kicked
out
of
IEM
Katowice
during
the
group
stage,
but
come
back
to
2-0
CJ
Frost
and
CJ
Blaze,
with
the
latter
of
the
two
being
one
of
the
teams
Gambit
lost
to
in
the
group
stage.
Gambit
would
participate
in
the
LCS
Spring
Split,
ending
up
2nd
in
the
region
behind
Fnatic.
On
4th
of
June,
Edward
leaves
Gambit
Gaming
due
to
communication
issues
with
Genja,
and
moves
to
NA
to
compete
in
the
NA
LCS
along
with
team
Curse.
He
is
then
replaced
by
D4rker,
who
already
trained
in
the
botlane
with
Genja.
After
couple
months,
D4rker
is
released
from
the
team,
and
the
Estonian
player
Voidle
replaced
D4rker
as
the
new
support
on
Gambit.
The
team
would
then
proceed
to
place
3rd
overall
in
the
Summer
split
of
the
LCS,
qualifying
for
the
season
3
World
Championships.
Following
their
8th-5th
place
finish
at
the
season
3
WCS,
player
Voidle
was
released
from
the
team.
After
several
weeks
of
speculation,
former
teammate
EdWard
would
rejoin
Gambit
Gaming,
and
would
proceed
to
help
the
team
take
a
perfect
victory
in
all
of
their
games
during
Intel
Extreme
Masters
Cologne.
