The
Journal
of
Justice
is
a
collection
of
news
articles
which
chronicles
the
events
currently
in
motion
on
Runeterra
.
The
Journal
issues
are
divided
into
volumes.
The
start
of
Season
Two
would
have
marked
the
start
of
Volume
Two.
It
was
put
on
hold
while
Riot
researched
other
ways
to
convey
the
lore.
[1]
Ultimately
it
was
removed
from
the
client
as
Kitae
was
chosen
as
the
new
head
of
lore
and
she
has
removed
all
mentions
of
the
League
of
Legends
and
the
Institute
of
War
through
reworks
of
champions.
An
Open
Letter
from
the
Editor-in-Chief
Senior
Summoner
Ralston
Farnsley
reporting
from
the
Institute
of
War
Welcome,
my
fellow
summoners
,
to
the
inauguration
of
the
League's
newest
journal
of
news
and
commentary.
Our
intent
with
the
Journal
of
Justice
is
to
bring
a
unique
perspective
on
the
events
that
shape
Runeterra
directly
to
you:
the
summoners
that
make
up
the
greatest
organization
that
civilization
has
ever
known.
There
have
been
other
chronicles
such
as
this
in
the
past,
though
they
found
themselves
without
such
a
noble
and
genuine
purpose.
Most
journals
lacked
direction
and
clarity.
For
too
long,
we've
had
to
separate
the
wheat
from
the
chaff
when
it
came
to
distilling
information
from
our
client
city-states.
With
the
Journal
of
Justice,
you
will
receive
accurate
and
thought-provoking
information
on
events
both
great
and
small
that
you
need
to
know
about.
Most
importantly,
through
your
participation
and
patronage,
you
will
help
guide
us
in
the
direction
we
will
take
with
this
journal.
Truly,
this
endeavor
will
be
history
in
the
making.
You,
the
summoners,
shape
Runeterra's
history
in
the
Fields
of
Justice
,
and
now
you
will
also
help
to
shape
it
here.
We
have
taken
our
first
steps
on
a
long
journey
together.
There
will
be
many
changes
and
improvements
the
journal
will
undergo
during
this
venture.
I,
for
one,
am
excited
to
see
where
it
all
will
lead
us.
