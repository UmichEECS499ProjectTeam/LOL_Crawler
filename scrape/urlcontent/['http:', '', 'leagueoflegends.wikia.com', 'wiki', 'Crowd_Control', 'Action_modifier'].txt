Forced
action
modifiers
A
special
form
of
CC,
but
equally
powerful,
are
the
forced
action
modifiers.
These
force
the
target
to
do
something,
temporarily
rendering
the
player's
input
useless.
Specifically,
taunts
force
the
affected
champion
to
attack
the
taunting
champion,
while
fear
causes
the
affected
champion
to
simply
run
around
aimlessly
for
the
duration.
