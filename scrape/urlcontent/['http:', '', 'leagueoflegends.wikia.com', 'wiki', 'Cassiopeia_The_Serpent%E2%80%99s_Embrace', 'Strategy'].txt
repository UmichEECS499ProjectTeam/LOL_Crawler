Don't
hesitate
to
spam
your
spells
since
Deadly
Cadence
makes
each
additional
cast
cheaper.
Noxious
Blast
does
not
require
a
target,
so
maintaining
your
5
stacks
is
easy
with
a
decent-sized
mana
pool.
Try
to
acquire
5
stacks
of
Deadly
Cadence
before
casting
Petrifying
Gaze
to
lower
its
mana
cost
significantly.
Cassiopeia
is
a
great
harasser
in
all
stages
of
the
game.
All
three
of
her
basic
abilities,
especially
Noxious
Blast
,
can
be
used
constantly
in
lane
to
zone,
capable
of
dealing
huge
amounts
of
damage
over
time
at
a
safe
distance.
Noxious
Blast
has
a
slight
delay;
lead
your
enemy
when
targeting
with
Noxious
Blast
to
ensure
the
hit,
or
use
it
on
them
when
they
will
have
to
stand
still
to
last-hit.
Using
Noxious
Blast
in
the
brush
does
not
reveal
Cassiopeia
,
so
when
in
the
side
lanes,
use
the
brush
to
your
advantage
to
harass
with
little
to
no
retaliation
from
enemy
minions.
When
chasing/fleeing,
be
sure
to
use
your
Noxious
Blast
on
an
enemy
champion
to
speed
yourself
up,
and
Miasma
to
slow
them
down.
Using
Miasma
in
the
middle
of
the
lane
when
enemy
minions
are
coming
will
slow
them
and
deal
some
damage
giving
advantage
to
your
minions,
this
tactic
is
best
used
in
pushes
as
intentionally
pushing
your
lane
during
the
laning
phase
opens
yourself
up
to
ganks.
Since
Miasma
grants
vision
over
the
area
affected,
it
can
be
used
to
check
brush.
Noxious
Blast
can
also
be
used
to
check
brush,
as
it
gives
you
a
movement
speed
bonus
(and
a
buff
icon)
if
an
enemy
is
hit.
If
you
cast
it
in
a
brush,
and
notice
the
buff
icon,
you
know
that
an
enemy
is
there.
Twin
Fang
becomes
extremely
powerful
if
the
target
is
poisoned,
allowing
you
to
deal
out
large
amounts
of
damage
with
its
low
conditional
cooldown.
It
is
very
highly
recommended
to
smart
cast
Twin
Fang
,
as
it
will
make
it
much
easier
to
land
the
maximum
amount
of
Twin
Fang
allowed
by
the
duration
of
your
poison
effects.
If
the
situation
is
favorable,
try
to
cast
Twin
Fang
while
directly
on
top
of
your
target,
as
Twin
Fang's
reduced
cooldown
begins
when
the
poisoned
target
is
hit
and
not
on
spellcast.
Due
to
Twin
Fang
having
the
potential
to
be
constantly
refreshed,
don't
be
afraid
to
target
durable
melee
champions
if
necessary.
Unlike
many
other
mages
that
rely
on
burst
damage,
Cassiopeia
and
her
Twin
Fang
can
realistically
cut
through
tough
enemies
with
time,
accuracy,
and
enough
mana.
Try
to
use
Petrifying
Gaze
offensively,
and
usually
against
more
than
one
target.
That
said,
it
can
also
be
used
when
being
ganked
to
escape
enemies.
It
is,
however,
safest
to
use
it
when
a
teamfight
has
happened.
The
enemy
will
be
less
likely
to
manage
to
turn
around
with
their
attention
split
amongst
five
champions
-
and
more
likely
to
all
be
facing
you
since
that
is
largely
required
to
fight
your
team.
Using
Petrifying
Gaze
followed
by
Miasma
,
Noxious
Blast
and
Twin
Fang
can
turn
most
1v1
fights
and
mid
game
turret
dives
in
your
favor.
Petrifying
Gaze
also
allows
Cassiopeia
to
be
a
very
strong
anti-ganker.
Simply
casting
it
when
your
lane
opponent
and
the
enemy
ganker
are
in
range,
then
bursting
down
the
weaker
one
with
your
combo
can
turn
the
2v1
into
a
1v1.
This
tactic
is
only
effective
when
your
Petrifying
Gaze
stuns
both
targets.
Cassiopeia
can
proxy
through
the
use
of
Noxious
Blast
and
Miasma
Build
usage
Buying
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
,
Will
of
the
Ancients
and
Liandry's
Torment
along
with
using
Twin
Fang
on
a
poisoned
enemy
gives
her
much
more
chasing
potential,
health
sustain,
burst
and
sustained
damage
but
don't
forget
to
hit
the
enemy
with
Noxious
Blast
from
time-to-time
to
refresh
the
poison
and
the
movement
speed
bonus
for
yourself.
Due
to
the
recent
buff
on
Rylai's
proc
with
Twin
Fang,
it
is
a
good
idea
to
purchase
it
for
chasing
potential.
Also,
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
plus
Miasma
adds
a
very
powerful
slow
to
your
enemies,
giving
Cassiopeia
more
time
to
chase
and
land
Twin
Fang
easily.
Void
Staff
works
fine
on
Cassiopeia
if
enough
enemies
have
a
high
amount
of
magic
resistance,
as
the
potential
low-cooldown
and
damage
on
Twin
Fang
lets
Cassiopeia
be
less
stringent
in
choosing
targets
compared
to
other
mages.
Buy
spell
vamp
items
like
Will
of
the
Ancients
to
quickly
restore
health
when
hitting
poisoned
targets
with
Twin
Fang
.
A
Catalyst
the
Protector
is
a
perfect
early
game
item
for
Cassiopeia
allowing
her
to
spam
her
spells
more
often
with
the
extra
mana
and
some
health
for
survivability.
This
can
then
build
offensively
into
an
early
Rod
of
Ages
or
a
more
defensive
Odyn's
Veil
.
Getting
a
Tear
of
the
Goddess
and
then
upgrading
it
into
an
Archangel's
Staff
will
greatly
increase
Cassiopeia's
ability
power,
as
well
as
solving
any
mana
problems
that
you
may
have.
It
is
also
quite
easy
to
gain
charges
with
the
low
cooldowns
on
her
spells,
as
well
as
constant
refreshing
of
her
passive.
Cassiopeia's
doesn't
necessarily
need
a
mana
fix,
thanks
to
her
passive
and
low
mana
costs.
However,
due
to
her
naturally
low
cooldowns
and
poke-heavy
style
of
play
in
lane,
she
can
easily
charge
Tear
of
the
Goddess
,
whose
ultimate
upgrade
Seraph's
Embrace
,
gives
Cassiopeia
more
AP
than
any
other
item
save
Rabadon's
Deathcap
and
Mejai's
Soulstealer
at
level
18,
as
well
as
a
nice
active.
The
AP
it
gives
will
be
even
greater
if
you
plan
to
build
other
mana
items
such
as
Rod
of
Ages
.
Avoid
building
cooldown
reduction
.
Because
Noxious
Blast's
damage
tick
is
constant
and
can
only
be
reapplied,
and
using
Twin
Fang
on
a
poisoned
enemy
reduces
the
cooldown
to
0.5
seconds
(which
cannot
be
further
reduced
by
CDR),
Cassiopeia
does
not
gain
the
significant
benefit
from
CDR
as
other
mages
do.
Therefore,
Rabadon's
Deathcap
will
be
the
major
purchase
for
when
you
want
more
damage
as
Cassiopeia
.

If
you
can
predict
when
Cassiopeia
will
use
Petrifying
Gaze
such
as
at
the
beginning
of
a
fight
or
at
the
end,
you
can
avoid
the
2
second
stun.
You
will
hear
Cassiopeia
gasp
before
she
activates
Petrifying
Gaze
(.65
casting
time),
so
you
have
a
brief
moment
to
react
to
Cassiopeia
.
Cassiopeia
relies
heavily
on
landing
Petrifying
Gaze
so
that
Miasma
and
Noxious
Blast
are
unavoidable.
When
dueling
her
she
will
put
Miasma
right
on
you,
despite
the
constant
damage
from
it
the
time
needed
to
move
out
will
let
her
spam
Twin
Fang
to
death.
It's
better
to
stay
in
the
venom
and
outburst
her.
Mages
with
strong
regenerative
abilities
like
Swain
,
Vladimir
,
or
Fiddlesticks
can
better
outlast
her
DoT
damage.
Even
with
her
passive,
avoiding
several
of
her
abilities
(better
said
Noxious
Blast
which
is
very
predictable)
will
quickly
lead
to
mana
problems.
Cassiopeia
lacks
a
powerful
instant
nuke
apart
from
Petrifying
Gaze
,
other
mages
who
can
nuke
potently
or
disabling
her
like
Malzahar
or
Xerath
can
effectively
counter
her
mid-late
game
Cassiopeia
has
excellent
range
on
Noxious
Blast
and
as
its
main
harassing
tool,
outranging
her
is
highly
beneficial,
mages
like
Lux
and
Brand
have
a
clear
advantage.
These
mages
can
also
outburst
her
if
done
correctly.
Cassiopeia
is
a
very
powerful
harasser.
Noxious
Blast
allows
her
to
give
her
lane
opponent
a
hard
time,
but
also
be
wary
for
Miasma
,
as
it
can
set
you
up
for
ganks,
make
landing
Noxious
Blast
or
especially
Twin
Fang
extremely
easy,
or
zone
you
from
minions
very
effectively.
Buying
Boots
of
Speed
is
a
good
and
cheap
way
to
limit
her
harassment.
Cassiopeia
is
extremely
proficient
at
1v1
fights,
having
the
most
sustained
damage
of
all
mages
(maybe
only
matched
by
Vladimir
).
Therefore
it
is
not
recommended
to
engage
her
alone.
Since
Cassiopeia
has
very
high
ability
power
scalings,
she
remains
a
constant
threat
to
AD
carries
late
game,
since
if
she
lands
her
ultimate,
she
can
easily
kill
an
AD
carry
without
resistances
within
the
2
second
stun
Petrifying
Gaze
provides
her.
Champions
who
can
outmatch
her
sustained
damage
but
also
survive
the
2
second
stun
like
Vladimir
,
Kayle
,
Elise
,
or
Swain
can
potentially
duel
and
kill
her.
Due
to
Noxious
Blast
and
Miasma
,
Cassiopeia
is
very
powerful
at
kiting.
If
she
gets
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
she
will
be
almost
impossible
to
reach
if
played
correctly;
do
not
engage
her
with
a
champion
without
strong
gap
closers
or
excellent
ranges
while
also
being
able
to
withstand
her
damage
in
a
1v1
fight.
Avoiding
her
Noxious
Blast
and
Miasma
is
critical
for
your
survival,
as
they
deal
heavy
DoT,
and
being
poisoned
allows
Cassiopeia
to
spam
her
Twin
Fang
on
you.
Also,
avoid
being
hit
by
the
poisons
of
other
champions:
Singed's
Poison
Trail
,
Teemo's
Toxic
Shot
/
Noxious
Trap
,
or
Twitch's
Deadly
Venom
which
will
also
allow
Cassiopeia
to
spam
her
Twin
Fang
.
