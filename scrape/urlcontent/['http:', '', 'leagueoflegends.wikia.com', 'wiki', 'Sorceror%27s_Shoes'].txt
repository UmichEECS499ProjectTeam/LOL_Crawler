Strategy
Sorcerer's
Shoes
is
an
extremely
good
item
for
magic-based
champions,
as
it
allows
you
to
ignore
15
of
your
enemy's
magic
resistance
.
Combining
these
with
magic
penetration
runes
can
be
devastating
for
opponents
with
low
magic
resistance
.
In
contrast,
Sorcerer's
Shoes
is
less
effective
for
non-offensive
casters
such
as
supports
or
tanks,
as
their
typically
low
magic
damage
stats
prevent
the
item
from
receiving
its
full
value,
compared
to
the
higher
damage
results
of
a
Carry.
One
of
the
two
defensive
boots
would
likely
be
a
better
pick,
as
the
added
survivability
will
be
of
more
value
to
these
roles.
These
boots
are
less
efficient
against
enemies
with
high
magic
resistance.
However,
they
synergize
well
with
other
magic
penetration
items,
percentage
items
such
as
Void
Staff
in
particular.
Trivia
Sorcerer's
Shoes
used
to
offer
flat
ability
power
and
had
an
Amplifying
Tome
in
their
recipe.
In
the
V1.0.0.52
patch,
the
ability
power
bonus
was
changed
to
flat
magic
penetration
,
and
the
Amplifying
Tome
was
dropped
from
the
recipe.
Background
For
nearly
a
century,
the
greatest
mage
in
Valoran
resided
in
the
scorched
desert
of
the
Zear
realm
until
the
first
crusade
of
the
Rune
Wars
devastated
the
entire
region
forcing
millions
to
flee.
The
crusaders
killed
all
desperate
travelers
attempting
the
mass
exodus
from
Zear,
but
one
mage
escaped
their
grasp
by
making
such
haste
across
the
land
that
word
spread
throughout
Valoran
that
the
very
shoes
this
mage
wore
must
be
imbued
with
immense
power.
