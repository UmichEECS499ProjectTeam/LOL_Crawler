Trivia
Zyra
was
designed
by
Morello
,
who
came
up
with
the
idea.
Coronach
and
CertainlyT
did
most
of
her
design.
[1]
[2]
[3]
Zyra
is
voiced
by
Karen
Strassman
,
who
also
voices
Cassiopeia
,
Fiora
,
Shyvana
,
and
Elise
.
Morello
stated
this
champion
was
inspired
by
Sadida's
Shoe
,
a
character
class
from
the
Dofus/Wakfu
games.
Zyra's
Rise
of
the
Thorns
is
similar
to
the
Sadida's
Still
Life.
Sadida
revives
as
an
Ultra-Powerful
Doll,
while
Zyra
turns
into
a
large
plant.
Zyra's
Rampant
Growth
is
similar
to
Sadida's
Doll
Seeds,
as
both
types
of
seeds
have
different
forms
depending
on
the
spells
used
on
them.
Zyra's
Grasping
Roots
is
similar
to
Sadida's
Bramble,
as
both
cover
the
enemy
in
thorny
roots
and
deal
damage.
Zyra
is
the
4th
champion
to
have
an
ability
that
allow
the
champion
to
attack
after
death.
Zyra's
ability
is
Rise
of
the
Thorns
,
while
the
others
are
Karthus's
Death
Defied
,
Kog'Maw's
Icathian
Surprise
and
Yorick's
Omen
of
Death
.
Zyra's
co-creator,
CertainlyT
,
hinted
in
the
LoL
forums
that
Zyra
has
three
hidden
passives
.
They're
confirmed
to
be:
Sion
:
When
either
Sion
or
Zyra
kills
the
other,
they
receive
a
bonus
+2
gold
(a
reference
to
Plants
Vs.
Zombies
).
Maokai
:
Maokai
gets
+1
movement
speed
if
he's
on
the
same
team
as
Zyra.
Leona
:
Leona's
passive
causes
Zyra
to
increase
in
size
for
a
short
time.
Zyra's
dance
resembles
the
basic
movements
for
the
dance
"
Cha-cha-cha
".
Zyra's
passive
was
called
Queen
of
Thorns
before
being
changed
to
Rise
of
the
Thorns
.
Zyra
is
the
fourth
champion
to
have
a
special
animation
while
using
Recall
or
Teleport
in
which
she
looks
up
and
extends
red
vines
in
her
arms
touching
the
ground.
Zyra's
name
resembles
the
word
"Zahra"
in
Arabic,
which
means
'blooming
flower'.
Zyra's
name
resembles
the
word
"Zera"
in
Hebrew,
which
means
'Seed'.
Zyra
is
the
fifth
champion
to
be
able
to
transform,
albeit
hers
has
a
different
mechanic
than
Elise
,
Nidalee
,
Shyvana
and
Swain
.
Zyra's
passive,
Rise
of
the
Thorns
,
and
ultimate,
Stranglethorns
,
have
a
cyan
hue
instead
of
green
in
her
Champion
Spotlight
.
Zyra's
Rampant
Growth
is
possibly
a
reference
to
the
Magic:
The
Gathering
card
of
the
same
name.
Zyra's
earring
has
some
resemblance
to
the
icon
of
the
Zerg
Swarm
in
Starcraft
2
-
a
comparison
can
be
found
here
.
Zyra
is
the
second
champion
who
shares
her
title
with
a
skill
name
,
after
Vayne
.
Zyra
was
speculated
to
be
a
stealth
champion
since
her
release
went
along
with
the
new
stealth
system.
Skins
Classic
Zyra
bears
resemblance
to
Poison
Ivy
from
the
DC
Universe
.
Classic
Zyra
bears
similarities
to
the
character
Sarah
Kerrigan
from
the
Starcraft
series
-
similar
appearance
and
voices,
titles
Rise
of
the
Thorns
and
Queen
of
Blades,
and
even
a
quote
-
Kerrigan
saying
"This
world
is
mine"
and
Zyra's
"This
land
is
mine"
.
Classic
Zyra's
hair
is
very
similar
to
Jessie
from
the
Pokemon
franchise.
