in

Notes
Because
killing
minions
disables
the
Tribute
passive
,
Frostfang
is
best
built
on
supports
who
are
able
to
harass
effectively
in-lane
.
The
damage
type
of
the
bonus
damage
will
match
the
trigger.
Area
of
effect
abilities
will
use
one
charge
per
enemy
champion
hit.
On-hit
effects
will
not
trigger
Tribute
(although
the
triggering
attack
can).
Damage
over
time
abilities
will
trigger
Tribute
once
per
instance
of
damage.
Trivia
Spellthief's
Edge
,
Frostfang
,
and
Frost
Queen's
Claim
are
all
tied
to
the
Freljord
.
This
item
's
original
name,
"Kage's
Lucky
Pick",
is
thought
to
be
a
reference
to
Kage's
quest
to
find
the
titular
Pick
in
Tenacious
D
in
The
Pick
of
Destiny
.
