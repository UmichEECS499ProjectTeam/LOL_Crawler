Explanation
The
unique
passive
on
Chalice
of
Harmony
is
commonly
misunderstood.
It
will
increase
mana
regeneration
from
all
sources
based
on
how
much
mana
the
champion
is
missing.
If
your
champion
has
0
mana,
they
are
missing
100%
of
their
mana
and
therefore
their
mana
regeneration
is
increased
by
100%
(i.e.
the
regeneration
is
doubled).
The
actual
amount
of
additional
regeneration
is
based
on
the
amount
of
base
mana
regeneration.
This
is
demonstrated
with
the
following
situations:
A
champion
has
8
Mp5
and
is
currently
at
25%
mana
(missing
75%).
Chalice
will
increase
regen
by
75%
to
yield
14
Mp5
(passive
provides
6
additional
Mp5).
A
champion
has
8
Mp5
and
is
currently
at
50%
mana
(missing
50%).
Chalice
will
increase
regen
by
50%
to
yield
12
Mp5
(passive
provides
4
additional
MP5).
A
champion
has
20
Mp5
and
is
currently
at
75%
mana
(missing
25%).
Chalice
will
increase
regen
by
25%
to
yield
25
Mp5
(passive
provides
5
additional
Mp5).
A
champion
has
10
Mp5
and
is
currently
at
75%
mana
(missing
25%).
Chalice
will
increase
regen
by
25%
to
yield
12.5
Mp5
(passive
provides
2.5
additional
Mp5).
With
greater
base
mana
regeneration,
the
unique
passive
on
Chalice
is
more
effective.
Ironically,
with
more
mana
regeneration,
the
Chalice
becomes
less
necessary,
unless
one
needs
it
badly.
However,
the
more
mana
you
have,
the
more
time
this
item
has
to
be
useful,
as
it
will
grant
you
increased
mana
regeneration
for
a
longer
time.
Notes
The
unique
passive
is
identical
to
the
effects
of
Veigar's
Equilibrium
.
Chalice
of
Harmony
most
benefits
champions
who
have
a
large
need
for
mana,
such
as
Karthus
,
Orianna
,
Anivia
,
Kassadin
,
and
Swain
.
It
can
be
used
by
any
mana
champion
as
a
source
of
emergency
sustain,
however.
Champions
who
have
no
real
use
for
ability
power
or
cooldown
reduction
are
not
necessarily
encouraged
to
buy
this
item
over
Tear
of
the
Goddess
,
as
Tear's
upgrade
Manamune
offers
far
more
relevant
stats
to
mana-hungry
AD
champions
than
Chalice's
upgrade,
Athene's
Unholy
Grail
.
The
unique
passive
increases
mana
regen
from
all
sources.
This
includes
items,
runes,
masteries
such
as
Meditation
,
and
champion
abilities
such
as
Singed's
Insanity
Potion
.
It
does
stack
with
Veigar's
Equilibrium
.
It
does
improve
regeneration
provide
by
the
Crest
of
the
Ancient
Golem
buff
and
the
Exalted
with
Baron
Nashor
buff
on
Summoner's
Rift
.
The
unique
passive
will
not
increase
mana
gained
from
methods
that
instanteously
return
a
specified
amount
of
mana
such
as
The
summoner
spell
Clarity
Defile's
passive
Carrion
Renewal
The
unique
passive
does,
however,
increase
mana
gained
from
a
Mana
Potion
.
That
is
because
mana
potions
do
not
literally
restore
mana
over
the
duration,
but
increase
the
user's
mana
regeneration
for
that
time.
That
boost
to
mana
regeneration
is
then
increased
by
the
Chalice's
passive.
