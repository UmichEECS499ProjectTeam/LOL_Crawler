Profile
In
the
days
of
yore
a
child
by
the
name
of
Veigar
was
born
in
the
island
nation
of
Iceland.
At
home
amongst
the
cliffs
and
fjords
of
his
native
homeland,
it
is
said
that
this
child
honed
his
warrior
skills
by
engaging
in
battle
with
entire
packs
of
timberwolves
armed
only
with
a
standard,
serial
input
ball
mouse.
After
proving
his
fighting
prowess
at
Holmgang
against
the
worlds
mightiest
champions,
Veigar
turned
his
thoughts
of
conquest
to
the
human
mind,
receiving
a
bachelor's
degree
in
psychology
from
Loyola
Marymount
University.
While
Veigar's
true
lineage
remains
a
mystery,
it
is
widely
believed
that
his
ancestors
include
Sigurd
Volsung,
Bjorn
Ironside,
Ragnar
Lodbrok,
Erik
the
Red,
Leif
Erikson,
and
possibly
Odin,
the
Allfather
himself.
Few
face
the
wrath
of
Veigar
the
Horrible
and
live
to
doubt
these
claims.
Special
Ability
Tower
Overwhelming
:
Veigar's
great
stature
provides
him
with
an
imposing
presence
unmatched
by
mere
mortal
men.
From
his
vantage
point,
Veigar's
watchful
gaze
is
able
to
spot
usurpers
(as
well
as
potential
game
issues)
and
smite
them
long
before
they
develop
into
a
threat.
Few
have
stood
in
the
shadow
of
Veigar
the
Horrible
and
survived
to
pass
on
their
frightful
tale.
