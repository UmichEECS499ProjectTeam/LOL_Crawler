A
Siege
Minion
is
one
type
of
minion
that
fights
in
League
of
Legends
.
These
minions
deal
more
damage
and
have
more
hit
points
than
regular
minions.
They
also
receive
only
70%
damage
from
towers
.
They
are
controlled
by
Artificial
Intelligence,
and
use
a
ranged
attack
against
their
enemies.
However,
their
range
is
lower
than
that
of
caster
minions
.
For
the
first
35
minutes,
1
Siege
minion
is
spawned
every
three
minion
waves
between
the
melee
and
ranged
minions.
From
the
35th
minute
onward,
Siege
minions
spawn
every
two
waves
to
accelerate
the
game
pace
by
making
pushing
easier.
