Kalamanda
Kalamanda
is
a
small
village
located
north
of
Mogron
Pass
on
Valoran
.
The
village
was
first
mentioned
on
the
first
issue
of
The
Journal
of
Justice
when
a
mass
deposit
of
gold
and
gems
and
two
nexuses
were
discovered
near
it.
The
deposit
has
led
all
city-states
to
set
camps
in
Kalamanda
in
an
attempt
to
obtain
a
trading
deal,
leading
to
high
tensions
between
them.

Lore
Kalamanda
was
once
a
sleepy
non-descript
village
located
near
the
northern
entrance
to
Mogron
Pass,
only
moderately
known
as
a
decent
place
to
fish
for
Valoran
trout
and
not
much
else.
However,
it
became
the
centre
of
the
Noxian-Demacian
conflicts.
Eventually,
the
disagreements
escalated
so
much
that
a
full
scale
war
began.
However,
due
to
Zilean's
(along
with
several
League
Summoners')
magical
temporal
stasis,
it
was
quickly
stopped.
However,
the
stasis
caused
the
village
to
become
magically
unstable
for
decades.
It
was
then
that
the
village
was
remade
into
the
Field
of
Justice
,
the
Crystal
Scar
.
History
The
Long
Sleep
of
the
Brackerns
Centuries
ago
there
lived
a
race
of
creatures
as
ferocious
as
they
were
wise.
The
brackern
were
unusual
beings
blessed
with
the
earth's
primal
magic,
embodied
in
the
form
of
crystals.
Their
kind
knew
of
an
arcane
ritual
to
bind
their
life's
essence
to
a
crystal,
communing
with
the
magic
embedded
in
it.
With
this
power,
the
brackern
thrived
in
the
Odyn
Valley,
protecting
both
creatures
and
crystals
alike.
Despite
attacks
from
those
looking
to
claim
the
primal
magic,
it
seemed
that
nothing
could
get
past
the
brackern's
defenses.
Nothing,
that
is,
until
the
devastation
of
a
Rune
War.
A
vicious
battle
was
fought
near
the
Odyn
Valley
and
the
unleashed
chaotic
magic
poisoned
the
crystals.
The
brackern
began
to
grow
sick
and
die,
and
no
amount
of
defensive
magic
could
reverse
the
effects.
To
avoid
extinction,
their
only
course
was
to
hibernate
underground
until
the
wars
stopped.
The
strongest,
most
intelligent
brackern
hibernated
closer
to
the
surface
to
awaken
first
and
assess
the
world's
condition
for
the
return
of
their
race.
Precious
Resources
Discovered
The
quiet
status
of
Kalamanda
drastically
changed
when
it
found
itself
the
leading
lady
on
the
world
stage.
The
Kalamanda's
mayor,
Anson
Ridley,
and
a
local
survey
team
had
uncovered
a
massive
deposit
of
gold
and
precious
gems
within
the
village's
sphere
of
influence.
Furthermore,
two
nexuses
of
considerable
magic
potency
had
been
discovered
alongside
the
resource
deposits.
When
news
of
this
spread,
adventurers
and
prospectors
from
across
the
continent
flocked
to
the
village,
seeking
fame
and
riches
beyond
their
wildest
dreams.
The
town
council
had
to
set
up
a
temporary
camp
located
near
the
foothills
that
lead
to
Mogron
Pass
and
the
Great
Barrier
in
anticipation
of
the
great
influx
of
individuals
hoping
to
trade
a
hard
day's
work
for
handsome
rewards.
Mayor
Ridley
acknowledged
that
Kalamanda
itself
was
not
properly
equipped
to
extract
and
process
the
raw
riches
that
lay
under
the
village
and
its
environment,
and
sought
to
partner
with
external
mining
companies
or
even
one
of
the
great
city-states.
With
the
discovery
of
two
massive
nexuses
in
close
proximity
to
the
valuable
resources,
the
League
had
also
taken
an
interest
in
Kalamanda's
recent
good
fortune.
Garen
and
Katarina
break
up
an
inter-city-state
brawl.
City-State
Tensions
Flare
As
reports
of
more
mineral
strikes
in
the
resource-laden
region
lure
prospective
hopefuls
to
Kalamanda,
Valoran's
city-states
had
added
to
the
growing
population
with
additional
personnel.
Demacia
and
Noxus
,
by
far,
had
invested
the
most
effort;
their
growing
presence
also
brought
with
them
a
rivalry
that
raised
tensions
within
the
village
to
dangerous
levels.
Kalamanda's
citizens
were
worried
that
their
good
fortunes
may
turn
for
the
worse
if
Demacia
and
Noxus
came
to
blows
over
the
future
of
their
village.
This
tension
manifested
itself
when
Demacian
and
Noxus
guards
drinking
at
the
Hasty
Hammer
Tavern
got
into
a
drunken
brawl
–
a
brawl
that
witnesses
claimed
was
"bordering
on
a
riot".
At
least
six
guards
were
seriously
injured
when
an
argument
between
the
rival
guards
erupted
into
violence.
It
took
what
appeared
to
be
the
entire
Kalamanda
constabulary,
several
local
patrons
of
the
tavern,
and
two
League
champions
to
break
up
the
fight.
The
next
day
the
Kalamanda
Village
Council
voted
in
favor
of
pushing
for
an
exclusive
mining
agreement
with
one
of
the
city-states,
as
opposed
to
allowing
multiple
contracts.
They
reasoned
that
they
did
not
wish
to
see
hatred
between
powerful
nations
rekindled
because
of
Kalamanda’s
mineral
bounty.
The
presence
of
just
a
single
city-state
would
be
in
everyone’s
best
interest.
Following
the
village
council
ruling,
both
Demacia
and
Noxus
increased
their
presence
within
Kalamanda,
as
both
city-states
have
emerged
as
the
leaders
in
securing
exclusive
mining
contracts
with
the
village.
Both
delegations
had
already
escalated
their
presence
in
Kalamanda
by
appointing
League
champions
as
the
leaders
of
their
respective
missions.
The
Demacian
delegation
was
led
by
Garen,
the
Might
of
Demacia
,
while
the
Noxus
delegation
was
directed
by
Katarina,
the
Sinister
Blade
–
the
eldest
daughter
of
one
of
Noxus'
top
generals
attached
to
the
Noxian
High
Command.
The
presence
of
the
champions
in
the
village
gave
a
clear
indication
that
both
Demacia
and
Noxus
were
committed
to
success
in
Kalamanda.
Zaun
Bribery
Exposed
Brandis
Reyes,
a
senior
member
of
the
Kalamanda
Village
Council,
was
ousted
after
he
was
found
to
be
taking
bribes
from
the
city-state
of
Zaun
.
An
investigation
by
Kalamanda
officials
began
after
a
large
amount
of
runes,
gems,
and
techmaturgical
devices
was
found
scattered
across
Reyes’
desk.
The
valuables
were
found
to
contain
trace
amounts
of
pollutants,
and
the
compositions
of
these
pollutants
allowed
Kalamanda
authorities
to
trace
the
valuables’
origins
to
Zaun.
Despite
Reyes’
claimed
that
he
was
being
framed,
further
investigation
revealed
that
Reyes
had
been
soliciting
other
council
members
in
an
attempt
to
influence
them
in
Zaun’s
favor
for
the
exclusive
mining
agreement
currently
under
consideration
in
Kalamanda.
As
a
result
of
the
attempted
bribery,
the
council
ruled
to
exclude
Zaun
from
the
pool
of
eligible
candidates.
Though
Zaun’s
presence
in
Kalamanda
was
relatively
small,
it
was
speculated
that
Zaun
was
turning
the
greatest
profit
due
to
its
rampant
usage
of
techmaturgical
devices
to
extract
the
precious
minerals.
Mining
devices
were
being
invented
and
deployed
day
and
night
from
the
Zaunite
camp.
Much
to
the
concern
of
the
village
residents,
the
environment
in
the
immediate
area
had
shown
signs
of
decay,
with
a
circle
of
dying
and
mutated
vegetation
seen
around
the
Zaunite
camps.
Residents
blamed
Zaun
for
its
careless
usage
of
toxic
chemicals,
unsafe
magic,
and
experimental
machinery.
However,
with
no
formal
guidelines
in
place
for
camp
inhabitants
due
to
the
rapid
influx
of
activity
within
the
city,
the
village
found
itself
at
the
mercy
of
Zaunite
operations.
Speculations
ran
rampant
that
this
may
harm
the
viability
of
Noxus’
bid
for
the
exclusive
contract,
as
Noxus
and
Zaun
were
well-known
allies.
The
nature
in
which
the
bribery
was
discovered
also
points
to
possible
involvement
from
other
city-states
currently
vying
for
the
exclusive
contract.
Kalamanda
officials
were
in
the
process
of
considering
banning
Zaun
from
mining
within
its
borders
entirely.
The
Mine
Collapse
Rescue
parties
rush
to
save
the
trapped
Demacian
miners.
An
earthquake
rocked
the
village
of
Kalamanda
causing
the
collapse
of
a
mithril
mine
and
trapping
twelve
Demacian
miners
underground.
Rescue
efforts
began
shortly
after
the
mine
caved
in.
The
League
offered
its
assistance
to
Demacia
in
its
rescue
efforts,
as
had
the
small
contingencies
of
Piltover
and
Ionia
.
Help
was
also
offered
by
the
Noxian
delegation
in
Kalamanda
–
a
surprising
move
considering
the
animosity
between
Demacia
and
Noxus
in
recent
years.
Evidence
of
Noxian
sabotage
discovered.
After
nearly
a
month
of
excavation
the
twelve
Demacian
miners
trapped
underground
had
finally
been
rescued.
Though
weakened
after
being
buried
underground,
all
twelve
miners
emerged
in
high
spirits.
However,
the
temporary
joy
and
peace
resulting
from
the
rescue
was
shattered
when
a
troubling
piece
of
evidence
was
discovered,
suggesting
that
the
cause
of
the
mine
collapse
was
man-made.
The
body
of
a
Noxian
soldier
was
recovered
underground
approximately
one
kilometer
east
of
the
trapped
miners,
where
geologists
had
estimated
the
initial
fault
point
of
the
collapse.
The
soldier
was
surrounded
by
various
Noxian
arcano-seismic
charges,
and
he
appeared
to
have
been
caught
unexpectedly
by
the
cave-in
after
the
charges
were
detonated.
An
official
investigation
was
immediately
launched,
with
Kalamanda
and
League
officials
working
in
conjunction
to
scrutinize
this
potentially
cataclysmic
breach
in
the
League
code.
Tensions
at
the
rescue
site
nearly
caused
a
fight
to
break
out,
but
the
Noxian
rescuers
lending
aid
withdrew
swiftly
in
order
to
avoid
conflict.
Demacia
Awarded
Exclusive
Contract
Although
the
investigation
of
the
mining
collapse
was
yet
to
reach
an
official
conclusion,
the
Kalamanda
Village
Council
made
an
immediate
ruling
to
grant
Demacia
the
highly
coveted
exclusive
mining
contract.
This
established
a
permanent
partnership
between
Kalamanda
and
Demacia,
bestowing
the
city-state
with
exclusive
extraction
rights
of
all
minerals
within
Kalamanda’s
lands.
In
return,
Demacia
would
commit
mining
resources
and
open
a
direct
trade
route
to
Kalamanda,
effectively
making
Kalamanda
one
of
its
incontiguous
provinces.
All
independent
and
city-state
affiliated
mining
parties
were
required
to
cease
activity
and
withdraw
all
mining
operations
from
the
village’s
boundaries.
A
formal
ceremony
was
made
in
the
courtyard
of
Kalamanda’s
Seat
of
the
Elders,
with
Mayor
Anson
Ridley
having
prepared
the
formal
documentation
for
his
village's
partnership
with
Demacia.
Accusations
against
Demacia
Swain
accuses
Demacia
of
framing
Noxus.
Kalamanda's
modest
population
prepared
themselves
for
the
arrival
of
Jarvan
III,
King
of
Demacia,
who
was
accompanied
by
his
son
Jarvan
IV,
the
Exemplar
of
Demacia
,
and
an
entire
phalanx
of
Demacian
Valor
Knights.
The
King
had
sent
word
that
he
would
visit
the
village
personally
to
sign
the
long-anticipated
agreement
granting
Demacia
exclusive
mining
rights
in
Kalamanda.
The
triumphant
atmosphere
became
subdued,
however,
when
Jericho
Swain,
the
Master
Tactician
,
appeared
with
his
own
military
entourage.
Kalamanda
officials
decided
to
proceed
with
the
signing,
but
before
the
Demacian
King
could
endorse
the
document,
Swain
emerged
from
the
crowd
with
a
bound
Demacian
soldier.
Swain
stated
that
the
man,
Thom
Garvin,
had
confessed
to
the
murder
of
the
Noxian
citizen
in
the
mines,
and
the
attempted
framing
of
Noxus.
When
the
King
asked
the
soldier
on
whose
orders
he
was
following,
the
soldier
sputtered
that
he
was
following
the
orders
of
the
King's
son,
Prince
Jarvan
IV.
The
ceremony
then
dissolved
into
chaos.
Mayor
Anson
Ridley
requested
that
the
signing
be
postponed
until
a
proper
investigation
could
be
conducted.
King
Jarvan
III
demanded
that
Garvin
be
released
into
Demacian
custody,
but
Swain
argued
that
Garvin
was
a
key
witness
and
could
not
be
entrusted
to
either
government.
He
suggested
instead
that
Garvin
be
held
by
local
authorities,
and
only
interrogated
with
representatives
of
both
city-states
present.
Ridley
agreed
to
the
proposition
and
Jarvan
III
followed
suit.
Before
the
prisoner
departed,
Jarvan
IV
accused
Swain
of
deception,
denying
any
involvement
in
a
conspiracy.
Troops
on
both
sides
were
called
to
the
sides
of
their
leaders,
but
King
Jarvan
III
managed
to
de-escalate
the
situation
by
silencing
his
son
and
forbidding
his
troops
to
engage.
He
stated
to
Swain
that
he
would
leave
peaceably,
and
requested
that
Swain
honor
the
dictates
established
by
the
League,
forbidding
open
combat.
Swain
consented,
and
withdrew
his
forces.
League
Adjudicators
were
dispatched
from
the
Institute
to
help
mediate
the
situation.
Refugees
of
Kalamanda
flee
the
village.
Reinforcements
Arrive
The
situation
in
Kalamanda
grew
dire
as
reinforcements
poured
in
from
both
Demacia
and
Noxus.
Spokesmen
from
both
delegations
promised
that
the
troops
were
merely
there
for
the
protection
of
the
important
city-state
leaders
present.
Both
encampments
awaited
the
interrogation
of
the
Demacian
prisoner,
which
was
delayed
at
the
request
of
King
Jarvan
III
of
Demacia,
without
any
public
explanation.
The
steady
influx
of
soldiers
had
transformed
the
Kalamanda
countryside,
dotting
it
with
military
tents
and
banners.
At
the
same
time,
many
Kalamanda
villagers
left
the
region
in
droves,
abandoning
their
homes
and
possessions
for
fear
of
imminent
violence.
The
Prisoner
Found
Dead
General
Boram
Darkwill
departs
from
Noxus.
The
Demacian
soldier
who
publically
confessed
to
mining
conspiracy
and
sabotage
was
found
dead
in
his
cell,
a
victim
of
Nyzer
poisoning.
There
was
an
investigation,
yet
Kalamanda
officials
were
unable
to
find
how
the
poison
managed
to
elude
the
notice
of
the
guards.
Suspicious
eyes
were
cast
on
the
visiting
delegations
of
Noxus
and
Demacia.
Though
representatives
from
both
city-states
denied
any
wrongdoing,
military
activity
visibly
increased
in
both
camps.
A
carriage
containing
General
Boram
Darkwill
himself
departed
Noxus
soon
after
the
prisoner’s
fate
was
discovered.
Swain
holds
vigil
as
the
bodies
of
fallen
Noxian
soldiers
are
put
to
flame.
Darkwill
Assassinated
General
Boram
Darkwill
and
his
accompanying
platoon
of
Raedsel
Guardsman
were
found
slain
on
the
roads
not
far
from
the
village.
Analysis
of
the
scene
indicated
that
the
entire
troop
was
eliminated
with
terrifying
efficiency.
Noxian
scouts
were
unable
to
find
any
traces
of
an
attacking
force
or
any
signs
of
survivors.
Swain
later
ordered
the
bodies
of
every
slain
Noxian
soldier
be
put
to
fire,
as
is
the
Noxian
ceremony
for
fallen
ranking
officers
in
wartime
conditions.
He
then
accused
Demacia
for
the
assault,
as
they
are
the
only
other
military
on
this
continent
which
was
capable
of
it.
In
a
public
response,
King
Jarvan
III
of
Demacia
decried
the
attack,
and
stated
that
he
did
not
order
the
assassination.
Swain
declined
Jarvan’s
invitation
to
discuss
the
situation,
which
may
indicate
that
the
damage
was
already
done.
The
last
remaining
natives
of
Kalamanda,
including
the
mayor
and
his
councilmen,
were
evacuated
from
the
region.
War
in
Kalamanda
Prince
Jarvan
IV
and
General
Swain
battle
amidst
the
chaos.
The
collective
fears
of
Valoran
were
realized
in
Kalamanda
as
the
standoff
between
Noxus
and
Demacia
escalated
to
all-out
war.
Initial
estimates
placed
casualties
in
the
hundreds.
It
appeared
that
Prince
Jarvan
IV
of
Demacia
struck
the
first
blow
against
General
Swain
of
Noxus.
According
to
eyewitnesses,
Swain
was
making
his
usual
rounds
of
the
Noxian
camp
when
he
was
ambushed
by
Jarvan.
The
two
became
locked
in
combat,
and
soldiers
from
both
camps
immediately
engaged
each
other
in
efforts
to
come
to
their
aid.
Though
battle
between
these
embittered
rivals
has
been
heated,
ambassadors
from
both
sides
pledged
that
their
forces
would
refrain
from
the
use
of
unsanctioned
magic.
Chancellor
Malek
Hawkmoon,
spokesman
for
Noxus,
called
it
a
“steel
and
slugs”
engagement,
a
Noxian
military
term
for
a
physical-only
wartime
operation.
Neither
army
gained
a
significant
advantage
over
the
other.
The
bulk
of
the
fighting
took
place
on
the
fields
just
outside
the
village’s
primary
dig
site,
though
the
contested
area
gradually
expanded.
Prince
Jarvan
was
not
seen
on
the
battlefield
since
his
initial
clash
with
Swain,
though
Noxus’
Master
Tactician
was
seen
in
the
front
lines,
issuing
commands
and
urging
his
troops
onward.
Jarvan’s
absence
caused
a
great
degree
of
speculation
that
the
Prince
may
have
been
killed
or
captured,
but
the
Demacian
forces
did
not
falter.
Their
morale
was
bolstered
by
Garen
and
the
Dauntless
Vanguard,
whose
efforts
stymied
the
Noxian
offensive
at
nearly
every
turn.
King
Jarvan
III
reportedly
donned
his
own
royal
armor,
although
his
exact
position
remained
a
mystery.
It
was
likely
that
Xin
Zhao,
the
Seneschal
of
Demacia
,
was
with
him.
League
intervention
leaves
warring
soldiers
suspended
in
time.
Kalamanda
Pacified
In
an
unprecedented
show
of
force,
the
League
of
Legends
conjured
a
temporal
stasis
bubble
over
the
entirety
of
Kalamanda,
trapping
the
warring
forces
of
Noxus
and
Demacia
in
a
mid-battle
state
of
suspension.
The
soldiers
inside
were
to
be
extracted
and
returned
to
their
homes,
but
the
League
pronounced
the
village
and
its
immediate
surroundings
uninhabitable.
The
League
had
sent
four
hundred
summoners
to
the
far
edges
of
the
Kalamanda
conflict,
transporting
with
them
a
small
nexus
that
was,
according
to
scholars
of
the
Arcanum
Majoris,
a
centerpiece
of
the
Arcanum
Vault.
Utilizing
ancient
Urtistani
techniques
refined
by
League
champion
Zilean,
the
Chronokeeper
,
these
summoners
undertook
an
enchantment
the
magnitude
of
which
hadn't
been
seen
in
Valoran
since
the
Rune
Wars.
A
great
deal
of
care
was
devoted
to
ensuring
that
Runeterra
sustained
the
least
possible
destruction
as
a
result
of
the
spell.
Though
experts
believed
the
damage
to
Runeterra
is
minimal,
they
have
determined
that
the
area
occupied
by
the
bubble
will
be
magically
unstable
for
decades.
Soldier
extraction
had
begun,
and
would
continue
for
several
weeks.
It
was
a
slow
and
intensive
process,
as
Zilean
believed
improper
extraction
may
lead
to
chrono-displasia,
a
disease
he
himself
endured.
League
surveyors
were
dispatched
to
the
village
to
assess
the
true
extent
of
the
damage,
as
well
as
to
determine
if
there
would
be
any
way
to
speed
its
restoration.
The
League
made
arrangements
for
the
families
of
Kalamanda
residents,
accepting
responsibility
for
restricting
them
from
their
own
homes.
Ambassadors
from
Noxus
and
Demacia
took
residence
in
the
Institute
of
War
and
negotiated
the
safe
return
of
their
soldiers,
as
well
as
terms
for
a
peaceful
resolution
to
the
conflict.
The
Crystal
Scar
The
re-construction
of
Kalamanda
to
become
a
Field
of
Justice.
Days
after
the
League’s
unprecedented
intervention
against
Noxus
and
Demacia’s
war,
a
portion
of
the
magically
contaminated
region
had
been
found
to
be
salvageable
and
will
be
re-purposed
into
an
official
Field
of
Justice
,
the
Crystal
Scar
.
High
Councilor
Heywan
Relivash
gave
the
announcement
to
a
gathered
group
of
summoners,
refugees,
and
city-state
representatives.
Those
gathered
for
the
announcement
responded
in
great
favor
to
the
initiative.
As
League
surveyors,
masons,
and
artificers
began
construction
in
Kalamanda,
Noxian
and
Demacian
ambassadors
continued
holding
negotiations
at
the
Institute
of
War.
King
Jarvan
III
arrived
to
represent
Demacia
and,
as
no
Grand
General
had
been
determined
at
the
time,
Jericho
Swain
represented
Noxus.
League
Champion
Kayle,
the
Judicator
,
presided
over
negotiations
alongside
the
High
Councilors.
Skarner
awakens
from
his
sleep.
The
Brackern
Awakens
After
centuries
of
hibernation,
the
mining
operations
and
violent
escalation
in
Kalamanda
were
enough
to
awaken
the
first
of
the
ancient
brackerns.
When
Skarner,
the
Crystal
Vanguard
,
burst
to
the
surface,
he
lashed
out
in
anger
and
confusion.
Reason
eventually
won
out
over
his
anger
when
he
realized
that
the
agents
of
the
League
who
found
him
were
simply
functionaries.
Skarner
was
invited
to
the
Institute
of
War
to
share
the
brackern's
story.
In
return,
the
summoners
told
him
about
the
history
that
his
kind
had
slept
through.
Much
had
been
done
to
curb
the
unchecked
use
of
magic
since
the
Rune
Wars,
but
it
was
obvious
that
the
world
was
not
yet
safe
for
his
kind
to
reawaken.
Skarner
now
works
to
use
his
power
to
change
the
world
into
one
in
which
his
kind
could
eventually
return.
Intruder
in
Kalamanda's
Prison
A
note
left
by
the
intruder.
An
anonymous
tip
led
the
remaining
Demacian
guards
in
Kalamanda
to
the
remnants
of
the
local
prison,
resulting
in
a
scuffle
with
an
unidentified
intruder.
The
suspect
was
caught
searching
the
same
ward
in
which
the
Demacian
prisoner
was
assassinated.
After
a
violent
confrontation
with
Garen,
the
Might
of
Demacia,
and
a
host
of
guards,
the
intruder
escaped
into
the
night.
Investigators
searched
the
area
and
discovered
that
the
intruder
had
left
behind
several
daggers
and
a
torn
note.
The
contents
of
the
note
had
yet
to
be
deciphered.
