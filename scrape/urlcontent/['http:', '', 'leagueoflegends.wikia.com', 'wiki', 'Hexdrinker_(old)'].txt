Builds
Into
Maw
of
Malmortius
Strategy
Hexdrinker's
shield
can
help
its
wielder
fight
through
otherwise
lethal
magic
damage.
This
may
take
opponents
by
surprise,
especially
if
the
opponent
tries
for
a
risky
burst
kill
but
fails
to
penetrate
the
shield
.
The
shield's
short
duration
challenges
users
to
make
the
most
of
the
moment.
Try
relying
on
the
shield
to
see
you
though
enough
magic
damage
to
ensure
your
own
kill,
or
to
make
a
grand
escape.
The
shield
can
block
a
considerable
amount
in
the
early
and
middle
stages
of
the
game,
but
it
does
not
scale
and
may
fall
off
in
the
late
game
should
opponents
obtain
more
powerful
spells
and
AP
items.
For
late-game
power,
try
upgrading
to
Maw
of
Malmortius
.
Increasing
magic
resistance
increases
the
total
damage
absorbed
by
decreasing
magic
damage
taken;
some
consider
this
to
be
"indirect
scaling."
