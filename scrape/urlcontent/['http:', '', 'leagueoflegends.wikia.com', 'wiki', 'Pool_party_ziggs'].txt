Trivia
Ziggs
is
the
first
champion
designed
by
Meddler
.
[1]
RiotRunaan
and
Harrow
were
the
creative
designers,
[2]
and
Isso09
was
part
of
the
team
which
did
his
concept.
[3]
Ziggs
is
voiced
by
Richard
Steven
Horvitz
,
who
also
voices
Rumble
.
Ziggs
is
named
after
a
nickname
for
game
designer
Ziegler
.
[4]
Ziggs'
smile
bears
a
resemblance
to
the
Cheshire
Cat
from
the
1865
novel
Alice
in
Wonderland
,
due
to
the
lack
of
canine
teeth.
Ziggs
also
has
a
similar
earring
to
that
of
the
Cheshire
Cat
from
the
game
American
McGee's
Alice
.
Ziggs
is
the
first
and
only
champion
so
far
to
have
all
their
abilities,
excluding
innates,
be
of
the
same
type
-
ground-targeted
area
of
effect
skillshots.
Ziggs
is,
along
with
Caitlyn
,
Lissandra
,
Rumble
,
Varus
,
Vi
and
Xerath
,
one
of
the
few
champions
that
can
CC
themselves.
Ziggs'
joke
could
be
a
reference
to
"The
Mask"
where
Jim
Carrey
eats
a
bomb
in
which
explodes
in
his
stomach
and
belches
fire.
Ziggs'
dance
is
a
reference
to
the
"Indian
Midget
Superstar".
A
side-by-side
comparison
can
be
seen
here
.
The
design
for
the
Mega
inferno
bomb
is
very
similar
to
actual
nuclear
weapons
mechanisms,
as
seen
here
Ziggs
is
quite
terrified
of
Jinx
because
Jinx
want
to
hug
Ziggs
all
the
time.
[5]
A
few
of
Ziggs
laughs
sound
similar
to
that
of
the
Jockey's
laughs
from
the
Left
4
dead
series.
Quotes
In
latinoamerican
servers
the
phrase
"I’m
going,
I’m
going"
is
changed
for
"Me
encanta
el
olor
de
los
explosivos
por
la
mañana"
("I
love
the
smell
of
explosives
in
the
morning")
in
honour
to
the
phrase
"I
love
the
smell
of
napalm
in
the
morning"
of
the
film
Apocaylpse
Now
.
Ziggs
is
the
only
champion
that
automatically
emotes
without
the
player
making
him
do
so.
Ziggs
laughs
by
himself
frequently
when
moving,
as
his
movement
animation
has
him
laughing.
Skins
Major
Ziggs
is
a
reference
to
the
grenadier
,
a
specialized
soldier
in
the
mid-to-late
17th
century,
whose
distinct
role
was
the
throwing
of
grenades
during
assault
operations.
Pool
Party
Ziggs
was
a
community
requested
skin,
inspired
by
MaTTcomGO's
artwork
.
The
skin's
splash
art
features
several
other
champions,
namely
(from
left
to
right):
Ahri
,
Garen
,
Renekton
,
Leona
,
Diana
,
Riven
,
Xin
Zhao
,
Katarina
,
Yorick
,
and
Darius
.
On
20th
August,
pool
party
skins
for
Leona
,
Lee
Sin
,
Renekton
and
Graves
are
announced.
Snow
Day
Ziggs
shares
the
Snow
Day
theme
with
Snow
Day
Singed
.
Relations
Ziggs
was
invited
to
work
at
the
famed
Yordle
Academy
in
Piltover
by
the
revered
inventor
Heimerdinger
.
Ziggs
accepted
the
proposal
to
work
at
the
Academy,
becoming
the
Dean
of
Demolitions.
