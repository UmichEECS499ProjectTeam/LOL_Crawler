Kill
to
death
ratio
Kill
to
Death
ratio
(often
referred
to
as
KDR
)
is
simply
the
number
of
kills
one
has,
divided
by
the
number
of
deaths
.
League
of
Legends
does
not
explicitly
track
this
information,
but
it
can
easily
be
calculated
manually.
A
more
modern
variant
of
this
ratio
is
the
KDA,
or
Kill
Death
Assist
(Ratio),
which
also
calculates
Assists.
Usage
For
DPS
champions
,
such
as
Assassins
or
Carries,
it
is
often
seen
as
one
of
the
most
effective
ways
to
evaluate
a
player's
performance.
Players
with
these
types
of
characters
should
be
achieving
a
KDR
greater
than
1.
In
addition,
new
and
lesser
informed
players
generally
believe
that
higher
KDR
indicate
better
players.
Other
types
of
champions,
such
as
Pushers,
Tanks,
and
Support
characters
do
not
emphasize
a
high
KDR
as
a
factor
of
a
successful
game,
but
take
other
factors
into
consideration.
Supports
and
Tanks
should
have
many
more
assists,
and
minimal
deaths.
Pushers
should
be
evaluated
by
the
amount
of
towers
they've
pushed
down.
In
a
game,
comparing
the
KDR
of
both
teams
as
a
whole
is
useful
as
a
very
rough
guide
of
how
well
both
teams
are
doing.
A
comparison
of
KDR
will
not
give
a
good
approximation
of
a
team's
total
gold.
This
means
that
a
team
can
have
more
gold
than
the
other
team
but
still
be
behind
in
total
kills.
Capturing
objectives
that
grant
gold
to
an
entire
team
such
as
destroying
turrets
or
defeating
large
jungle
creeps
not
only
provides
much
more
total
gold
to
the
team,
but
it
also
gives
map
control,
which
can
leave
other
objectives
vulnerable
and
easier
to
capture.
A
player
may
be
described
as
having
a
"negative"
KDR.
This
is
a
misnomer
and
simply
means
that
the
player's
KDR
is
less
than
1.
Examples
If
Player
1
scores
a
6:2:5,
the
K/D-Ratio
is
6
/
2
=
3.0
.
If
Player
2
scores
a
2:6:8,
the
K/D-Ratio
is
2
/
6
=
0.33
.
If
Player
3
scores
a
4:2:17,
the
K/D-Ratio
is
4
/
2
=
2.0
.
Keep
in
mind
that
assists
play
an
important
role
that
can
not
be
seen
by
just
calculating
the
K/D-Ratio.
That
is
why
the
KDA
(Kills
/
Deaths
/
Assists)
ratio
is
used
more
in
tournaments
to
display
teamwork
and
skill.
For
example,
Player
3
(
10,5
)
has
a
higher
KDA
ratio
than
Player
1
(
5,5
)
and
helped
the
team
more
even
though
Player
1
has
a
higher
KD
ratio.
Another
type
of
scoring
is
dominance
factor
(DF)
,
shows
even
more
domination
is
simple.
Kills
count
as
2,
deaths
count
as
-3,
and
assists
are
1.
This
may
seem
slightly
confusing
at
first
but
let's
look
at
the
examples
from
above.
If
Player
1
scores
a
6:2:5,
the
DF
would
be
11.
If
Player
2
scores
a
2:6:8,
the
DF
would
be
-6.
If
Player
3
scores
a
4:2:17.
the
DF
would
be
19.
As
you
can
see
this
accounts
all
aspects
and
can
give
you
a
more
accurate
reading.
This
also
gives
more
opportunity
to
those
who
play
supports.
