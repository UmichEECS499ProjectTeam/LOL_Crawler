Skill
usage
Nasus'
Soul
Eater
will
keep
him
sustained
in
jungle
or
in
a
solo
lane.
Constantly
last
hitting
with
Siphoning
Strike
will
have
an
enormous
impact
at
the
end
of
a
game,
and
will
be
your
primary
source
of
damage.
Nasus
can
farm
many
more
Siphoning
Strike
stacks
on
minions
while
solo
laning
than
from
camps
while
jungling.
If
you
are
are
having
difficulty
last
hitting
minions
with
Siphoning
Strike
(against
strong
zoners),
request
a
lane
change
or
a
gank.
The
damage
from
Siphoning
Strike
will
proc
on
turrets
.
Use
it
to
quickly
take
down
turrets.
Using
Wither
on
your
targets
will
make
it
easier
to
land
Spirit
Fire
before
using
Siphoning
Strike
,
as
Spirit
Fire
greatly
reduces
the
target's
armor
,
making
you
hit
much
harder
than
normal.
Wither
is
best
used
to
shut
down
auto-attack
dependent
champions,
slowing
them
to
a
crawl
and
reducing
their
attack
speed
dramatically.
Choose
your
target
wisely
(usually
a
carry)
when
casting,
as
the
moderate
cooldown
isn't
very
forgiving
if
you
choose
poorly.
With
high
amounts
of
cooldown
reduction,
Nasus
can
almost
continuously
maintain
Wither
on
the
enemy
team
(5
sec
duration,
6.6
sec
cooldown).
However,
enemy
tenacity
can
counter-act
this.
Without
any
gap-closers
or
mobility,
Nasus
relies
on
his
Wither
to
protect
himself
from
being
kited.
Be
careful
when
using
Spirit
Fire
near
your
tower,
as
it
will
push
the
lane
and
you
will
lose
last-hits.
During
the
laning
phase,
Spirit
Fire
will
discourage
your
enemies
from
farming,
but
it
has
a
relatively
high
mana
cost.
Nasus's
ultimate
can
be
used
at
the
start
of
team
fights
as
you
will
be
doing
constant
AoE
damage
to
enemies
while
gaining
attack
damage
for
big
hits.
It
can
also
be
saved
for
the
end
of
a
fight
to
bait
enemies
with
the
health
boost
(stronger
in
small
fights).
Fury
of
the
Sands
can
be
used
offensively
or
defensiviely,
use
it
to
catch
or
escape
enemies,
as
it
also
gives
a
massive
health
boost.
A
team
with
Nasus
can
kill
Baron
Nashor
earlier
because
his
Fury
of
the
Sands
and
passive
life
steal
from
Soul
Eater
lets
him
tank
and
kill
it
much
more
easily.
Build
usage
Nasus
can
be
itemized
as
a
melee
DPS
,
as
a
tank
,
or
as
an
off-tank,
based
upon
the
rest
of
your
team
composition.
Generally
speaking,
a
tanky
build
is
considered
optimal
on
Nasus,
due
to
his
naturally
high
late-game
damage
from
Siphoning
Strike
,
which
also
makes
him
a
priority
target
for
the
enemy
team.
As
Nasus
relies
on
Siphoning
Strike
as
his
primary
source
of
damage,
it
is
important
to
stay
in
lane
in
order
to
continuously
farm
Siphoning
Strike
.
Any
items
to
sustain
him
in
lane
with
mana
and
health
like
a
Philosopher's
Stone
or
a
Catalyst
the
Protector
are
important.
Building
early
resistances
like
a
Cloth
Armor
or
a
Null-Magic
Mantle
according
to
the
main
damage
source
can
allow
you
to
take
a
little
more
harass
and
stay
in
lane
longer.
Think
about
buying
Chalice
of
Harmony
early.
Although
it
doesn't
build
into
any
items
that
are
particularly
useful
for
Nasus,
he
will
constantly
have
mana
to
constantly
farm
minions
.
An
early
Tear
of
the
Goddess
into
a
Manamune
also
solves
Nasus's
mana
hunger.
The
Manamune
also
synergizes
well
with
items
like
Sheen
,
Trinity
Force
and
Frozen
Heart
,
which
are
all
good
items
for
Nasus.
The
bonus
damage
makes
it
easier
to
farm
for
his
Siphoning
Strike
.
The
life
steal
from
Soul
Eater
grants
him
sustainability,
allowing
him
to
build
other
items
.
The
Bloodthirster
should
not
be
ignored
simply
because
of
Nasus's
innate
abilities.
In
a
more
offensive
build,
The
Bloodthirster
synergizes
well
with
Nasus's
life
steal
passive
and
Siphoning
Strike
damage
and
can
help
deal
as
well
as
take
more
damage
if
Siphoning
Strike
isn't
that
well
farmed.
Sheen
and
Trinity
Force
synergize
with
the
proc
on
Siphoning
Strike
,
greatly
increasing
your
damage
output.
Trinity
Force
as
well
as
its
components
work
very
well
with
Nasus.
Wither
and
a
Phage
can
keep
an
enemy
constantly
in
melee
range
as
well
as
the
Spirit
Fire
area
of
effect
.
Sheen's
passive
stacks
with
Siphoning
Strike
for
more
damage
and
providing
more
mana
to
better
farm
minions
.
Zeal
offers
some
critical
strike
and
attack
speed
to
do
more
damage
and
movement
speed
to
stick
to
enemies.
Glacial
Shroud
and
Frozen
Heart
offer
Nasus
cooldown
reduction
and
mana
,
which
allow
Nasus
to
use
his
Siphoning
Strike
more
often,
as
well
as
giving
him
armor
and
an
attack
speed
debuff
aura
.
Iceborn
Gauntlet
gives
both
the
Spellblade
passive
from
Sheen
and
the
stats
of
Glacial
Shroud
.
Whether
buying
it
as
replacements
for
Trinity
Force
and
Frozen
Heart
being
a
better
option
is
debatable.
Nasus
can
also
be
used
as
an
ability
power
champion,
relying
on
items
as
Abyssal
Scepter
and
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
for
damage
and
utility
with
his
Spirit
Fire
and
Lich
Bane
for
increased
damage
with
his
Siphoning
Strike
,
while
still
building
defensive
items
like
Frozen
Heart
and
Guardian
Angel
.
This
type
of
build
is
more
focused
on
dealing
damage
to
multiple
enemies
as
his
both
Spirit
Fire
and
Fury
of
the
Sands
will
deal
more
damage.
Whilst
generally
considered
inferior
on
Summoner's
Rift,
this
type
of
build
is
more
favourable
on
other
maps
due
to
lack
of
opportunities
there
to
farm
Siphoning
Strike
;
this
is
particularly
true
of
the
Howling
Abyss.
Do
not
make
the
mistake
of
purchasing
Tiamat
or
Ravenous
Hydra
on
Nasus
as
the
items
have
almost
no
synergy
on
him
whatsoever.
Not
only
do
enemies
killed
by
the
Cleave
passive
effect
not
count
towards
increasing
the
damage
of
Siphoning
Strike
,
but
neither
the
Cleave
passive
nor
the
Crescent
active
even
apply
any
of
the
the
bonus
damage
of
Siphoning
Strike
,
since
the
damage
they
do
is
based
solely
on
Attack
Damage
and
does
not
include
on-hit
effects
.
More
importantly,
the
splash
damage
will
cause
minions
to
die
faster,
making
it
considerably
harder
for
Nasus
to
farm
Siphoning
Strike
effectively.
However,
the
passive
and
active
do
greatly
help
with
Nasus'
split-pushing
abilities
(something
he
excels
at
due
to
Siphoning
Strike
's
ability
to
let
him
take
down
turrets
rapidly),
and
also
proc
the
life-steal
both
from
the
item
itself
and
from
Soul
Eater
,
adding
to
his
survivability
in
team-fights.
All
this
makes
it
a
relatively
effective
late-game
choice
on
Nasus
in
a
more
offensive
build.
Because
Siphoning
Strike
no
longer
proc's
critical
strike
,
this
makes
armor
penetration
the
only
option
to
increase
the
infinitly
scaling
bonus
damage.
This
makes
The
Black
Cleaver
and
Last
Whisper
very
good
items
for
Nasus
late
game.
The
Black
Cleaver
is
good
for
the
armor
pen,
cooldown
reduction,
health,
and
superior
ad
compared
to
the
Last
Whisper
.
However,
Last
Whisper
is
still
viable
due
to
the
larger,
and
more
reliable,
%
armor
pen.
Randuin's
Omen
is
an
excellent
armor
item
on
Nasus,
as
it
makes
him
more
difficult
to
kite,
which,
despite
Wither
,
is
still
one
of
his
few
weaknesses
late
game.
The
active
also
becomes
more
effective
the
more
resistances
you
build,
making
it
especially
effective
on
a
tanky
build.
When
itemizing
for
defences
on
Nasus
,
prioritize
resistances
over
straight
health,
as
this
will
make
both
your
innate
life-steal
and
the
bonus
health
from
Fury
of
the
Sands
more
effective.
With
that
said,
do
not
neglect
to
purchase
health
entirely,
as
when
you
have
built
some
resistances,
these
will
cause
it
to
scale
rather
well.

Consider
using
life
steal
Quintessences
on
Nasus;
they
are
the
most
effective
sustain
tool
for
him.
This
is
because
his
Siphoning
Strike
procs
life
steal.
While
the
damage
of
Siphoning
Strike
rises,
the
sustain
gets
even
bigger.
Countering
Nasus's
strength
comes
from
his
ability
to
farm
Siphoning
Strike
.
Try
to
zone
him
or
deny
his
chance
of
last-hitting
minions.
Building
Tenacity
will
reduce
the
duration
of
Nasus's
Wither
.
However,
remember
that
its
maximum
slow
will
be
applied
quicker
than
usual
due
to
the
shortened
duration.
Nasus
is
susceptible
to
crowd
control
.
Ranged
champions
should
invest
in
a
Frozen
Mallet
or
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
to
prevent
him
from
getting
into
melee
range.
Stacking
health
will
only
make
Nasus's
Fury
of
the
Sands
stronger.
Build
armor
and
magic
resist
as
well.
