During
the
chaos
of
the
Rune
Wars,
an
enormous
runestone
was
lost
deep
within
the
Plague
Jungles
.
It
remained
there,
untouched
for
centuries,
emanating
a
potent
magic
which
infused
nearby
wildlife
with
sentience
and
vitality.
A
group
of
monkeys
who
were
particularly
empowered
by
it
came
to
worship
the
stone,
and
their
leader
-
a
wise
sage
-
became
convinced
that
he
could
harness
its
power
to
make
the
monkeys
immortal.
He
performed
an
elaborate
ritual,
but
things
didn't
go
as
he
expected.
The
runestone
was
destroyed,
and
instead
of
granting
immortality,
it
produced
Kong,
a
monkey
who
carried
in
his
heart
the
strength
and
power
it
had
contained.
Kong
was
driven
by
an
unquenchable
desire
for
greatness.
He
sought
out
every
beast
and
monster
the
Plague
Jungles
could
offer,
eager
to
find
a
worthy
opponent,
but
none
offered
the
challenge
he
craved.
He
asked
the
sage
for
advice,
and
learned
about
a
legend
of
hairless
monkeys
to
the
north
who,
with
wits
and
might,
had
bent
the
world
to
their
will.
Kong
left,
journeying
north,
determined
to
discover
if
the
legend
was
true.
He
crossed
the
Southern
Wastes
and
then
the
Great
Barrier.
On
his
way,
he
happened
upon
Master
Yi
,
who
was
deep
in
meditation.
Kong
asked
him
who
the
strongest
warrior
in
the
north
was,
and
Yi
told
him
about
the
League
of
Legends
.
The
tale
intoxicated
Kong,
a
place
where
he
could
battle
the
strongest
fighters
in
the
world
was,
to
him,
paradise.
Kong
asked
Yi
to
introduce
him
to
this
League,
and
to
teach
him
the
ways
of
humans,
so
that
he
could
be
a
fitting
champion.
In
return,
he
would
honor
Yi
by
using
Yi's
Wuju
style
to
become
the
greatest
warrior
Runeterra
had
ever
seen.
Admiring
his
passion,
Yi
agreed,
but
under
the
condition
that
Kong
would
one
day
teach
the
lessons
of
Wuju
to
a
pupil
of
his
own.
In
the
spirit
of
this
agreement,
he
renamed
Kong
Wukong,
and
gave
him
a
weapon
suited
to
his
unusual
nature
-
an
enchanted
staff
that
the
young
Doran
had
crafted.
The
weapon
was
an
unrivalled
masterpiece.
Guided
by
Yi,
Wukong
joined
the
League
of
Legends
to
prove
himself
as
the
best,
and
to
show
the
world
the
true
power
of
Wuju.
"Only
in
combat
do
you
learn
who
you
truly
are."

CLE
OBSERVATION
Wukong
charges
into
the
Great
Hall,
bursting
with
anticipation.
The
promise
of
a
challenge
excites
him.
His
movements
seem
frenzied
and
wild,
but
for
all
their
apparent
disorganization,
he
never
seems
to
be
off-balance.
His
head
darts
from
side
to
side.
It's
unclear
whether
he
is
watching
for
threats
or
trying
to
take
everything
in
at
once
–
probably
both.
When
he
is
satisfied
that
has
seen
or
poked
everything
in
the
area,
he
proceeds
to
the
doors.
This
moment
has
been
too
long
in
the
waiting.
REFLECTION
Wukong
was
still
unaccustomed
to
the
confining
structures
that
humans
liked
to
build
around
themselves.
He
could
understand
the
need
for
shelter,
but
in
a
place
where
man's
society
dominated
the
landscape,
there
weren't
many
dangers
left.
Master
Yi
had
explained
the
concept
of
"privacy"
to
him
at
length
(mainly
because
Wukong's
prying
curiosity
apparently
often
violated
it),
but
he
still
didn't
quite
understand
why
people
would
willingly
spend
so
much
time
cut
off
from
the
world
around
them.
Did
they
not
enjoy
the
sun
on
their
skin?
Or
the
scents
carried
on
the
wind?
Maybe
it's
just
a
fur
thing,
he
mused.
In
the
Plague
Jungles,
Wukong
would
spend
nights
on
the
highest
bough
of
the
tallest
tree,
drifting
asleep
to
the
melody
of
thousands
of
creatures
serenading
the
starlight.
Despite
all
the
wonders
man
had
achieved,
nothing
had
quite
the
same
simple
elegance.
It
seemed
the
nature
of
people
was
to
seek
out
and
foster
complications
in
their
lives
until
even
the
most
fundamental
behaviors
came
with
guidelines
and
instructions:
table
manners,
bathroom
etiquette,
courting
rituals,
rules
of
engagement.
To
breach
any
rule
was
to
invite
further
complications.
It
was
exhausting
and
often
pointless.
However,
for
all
the
quirks
that
humans
had,
they
were
truly
remarkable,
and
their
warriors
presented
Wukong
with
challenges
he
couldn't
find
in
the
Plague
Jungles
–
challenges
he
once
worried
might
not
exist.
He
recalled
the
feeling
of
desperation
that
day,
right
after
his
bout
with
the
sea
dragon,
when
his
every
goal
had
been
realized,
every
opponent
defeated.
His
frantic
ambition
gave
him
drive
and
purpose,
but
consumed
him
when
deprived
an
outlet.
Like
him,
it
was
a
product
of
the
Plague
Jungles,
where
uneven
concentrations
of
magic
and
life
would
well
up
until
they
burst
–
evolution
in
overdrive.
The
nearby
crunch
of
a
crushed
leaf
jarred
him
from
his
thoughts.
Instinctively,
Wukong
bent
backward,
just
in
time
to
avoid
the
sweep
of
a
familiar
weapon.
As
it
passed
over
him,
he
could
make
out
Doran's
distinctive
craftsmanship
–
it
was
his
own
staff.
Had
someone
stolen
it?
His
focus
fell
to
his
fingers
and
he
was
relieved
to
find
it
still
clutched
within
them.
Wukong
allowed
his
momentum
to
carry
him
into
a
backflip,
and
he
brought
the
weapon
up
defensively
the
second
his
feet
touched
the
soil.
Soil...where
am
I?
He
glanced
at
his
surroundings
and
recognized
the
vibrant
ferns,
towering
kopak
trees,
and
sprawling
vines
in
an
instant.
How
had
he
returned
to
the
Plague
Jungles?
More
importantly,
who
had
just
attacked
him?
He
scanned
the
immediate
area
but
could
find
no
sign
of
the
aggressor.
There
was
no
way
anyone
could
have
gotten
away
so
fast.
He
peered
through
the
lush
vegetation,
looking
for
signs
of
someone's
passing.
He
had
the
space
of
a
gasp
to
notice
a
curious
shadow
before
he
was
struck
squarely
in
the
chest
by
a
jab
from
the
imposter
weapon.
It
came
from
nearly
twenty
feet
away,
stretching
several
times
its
normal
length
to
reach
him.
Knockoff
or
not,
it
apparently
shared
the
unique
qualities
of
the
original.
The
blow
knocked
the
wind
out
of
him,
and
sent
him
sliding
along
the
jungle's
mossy
floor.
He
stayed
on
his
feet,
but
struggled
to
maintain
his
composure
as
he
coaxed
air
back
into
his
lungs.
A
blur
in
the
corner
of
his
vision
announced
the
next
assault,
and
Wukong
was
able
to
identify
his
assailant's
glinting
gold
armor
before
he
was
beset
by
a
flurry
of
attacks.
The
form
was
unmistakable.
It's...me?
On
his
heels,
Wukong
could
barely
keep
upright
as
he
parried
the
furious
onslaught.
The
rogue
clone
was
faster
than
he
was,
and
its
strikes
were
well-chosen
and
well-placed.
Wukong
tried
to
control
the
clone
as
he
would
one
of
his
own
illusions,
although
he
was
unsurprised
when
that
failed.
This
clone
wasn't
one
of
his
tricks,
it
was
something
different
entirely.
Had
the
jungle
produced
another,
possibly
better
monkey
king?
He
was
horrified
by
the
thought.
Wukong
saw
an
opening
in
the
clone's
barrage,
and
he
unleashed
a
powerful
blow.
He
timed
it
perfectly
–
the
clone
had
no
time
to
react
before
Wukong's
staff
collided
with
its
jaw.
When
he
made
contact,
the
clone
vanished
in
a
puff
of
smoke.
Uh
oh.
Wukong
knew
this
tactic
all
too
well.
He
tried
to
block
the
attack
he
knew
would
come
from
behind
but
he
wasn't
fast
enough.
Bright
pain
filled
his
vision
and
he
collapsed
face-first
into
mud
and
ferns.
As
he
tried
to
blink
the
world
back
into
his
eyes,
the
clone
circled
him
slowly,
savoring
its
advantage.
"Why
do
you
want
to
join
the
League,
Wukong?"
The
question,
delivered
in
his
own
voice,
rattled
him.
"To
be
the
best,"
he
rasped,
spitting
dirt.
"You
have
a
long
way
to
go."
"That's
the
fun
part."
Wukong
got
to
one
knee.
"When
you're
at
the
top,
there's
nowhere
left
to
go."
He
eyed
the
clone
curiously,
perhaps
things
weren't
as
they
seemed.
"But
I'm
not
as
far
away
as
you
think."
He
grinned
mischievously,
and
the
clone
lashed
out
with
its
staff,
sensing
danger.
All
it
hit
was
a
cloud
of
smoke.
Wukong
hurtled
through
the
air
behind
it,
one
hand
latched
onto
a
vine,
the
other
holding
the
staff
out
like
a
lance.
The
clone
whirled
around
faster
than
the
eye
could
see,
its
staff
cutting
a
vicious
arc
for
Wukong.
It
hit
its
mark
perfectly,
and
just
in
time,
but
Wukong
just
burst
into
another
cloud.
The
trees
were
coming
alive
now.
Another
Wukong
swung
down
from
a
vine,
then
another,
and
another.
The
clone
moved
like
a
machine,
barely
intercepting
every
attack
but
slowly
becoming
obscured
in
fog
as
they
all
dispersed
harmlessly
in
front
of
it.
It
tried
to
move,
to
find
some
better
ground,
but
Wukongs
poured
from
the
trees,
surrounding
and
suppressing
it
with
unrelenting
strikes.
One
Wukong
stood
outside
the
cloud,
arms
folded,
watching
as
the
clone
struggled
to
resist
being
overwhelmed.
"You
know,
human,
things
are
different
in
the
Plague
Jungles.
We
aren't
provided
for,
we
aren't
protected.
Most
creatures
don't
fight
for
fun
here
–
most
fight
to
survive."
He
ducked
as
the
clone's
staff,
shooting
out
from
the
cloud,
sought
to
land
a
lucky
strike.
"But
I
fight
to
be
the
best.
That's
what
makes
me
special.
That's
why
I
left
to
find
your
League.
That's
why
I
will
be
the
greatest."
The
clone
was
visibly
losing
steam.
Wukong
plucked
a
peach
from
a
nearby
tree
and
took
a
bite.
It
tasted
divine.
"As
a
people,
you
have
the
world
at
your
fingertips,
but
alone,
most
of
you
crumble
in
the
face
of
true
adversity,"
he
slurped
through
a
mouthful
of
peach.
Suddenly,
before
his
eyes,
the
jungle
dissolved.
He
dropped
the
peach,
but
it
was
gone
before
it
reached
the
ground.
Only
the
clone
remained
against
a
backdrop
of
darkness.
Its
eyes
burned
brightly,
but
its
expression
was
pleased.
"How
does
it
feel,
exposing
your
mind?"
Wukong
tapped
the
clone
on
the
shoulder
from
behind,
the
Wukong
it
was
facing
vanished,
leaving
the
same
poof
of
smoke.
"I
told
you
I
wasn’t
as
far
as
you
thought,"
he
said
with
a
smile.
Scowling,
the
clone
disappeared
and
then
Wukong
was
back
in
the
Institute.
He
chuckled.
Humans
and
their
rituals.
Nonetheless,
another
trial
passed,
another
obstacle
overcome.
Now
it
was
time
to
put
this
League
to
the
test.
