Redirected

Feeder
"Claw
or
spear,
your
end's
the
same."
It

Feeding
is
the
act
of
being
killed
repeatedly,
and
thereby
assisting
the
enemy
team.
This
can
happen
by
repeatedly
overextending
the
champions
capabilities,
by
lack
of
skill,
false
positioning,
being
too
weak
and
thereby
unable
to
compete
with
any
other
champion,
or
even
intentionally.

Active
Feeding
(feeder)
If
a
champion
gets
killed
repeated
thereby
often
more
damaging
to
the
team
than
a
summoner
who
leaves
the
game
or
does
nothing
at
all.
Passive
Feeding
(being
fed)
Feeding
can
also
be
a
passive
act.
If
several
players
die
to
one
champion,
it
will
gather
high
amounts
of
gold,
the
fed
champion
will
more
likely
be
able
to
defeat
single
champions
in
the
future.
A
champion
is
considered
to
be
"fed"
as
soon
as
his
potential
to
be
useful
in
game
and
to
score
kills
is
obviously
significantly
higher
than
any
other
champions.
Especially
carry
champions
profit
from
being
fed
since
their
strength
in
game
massively
depends
on
the
items
they
have.
Motives/Griefing
Feeders
do
not
necessarily
assist
the
enemy
team
intentionally.
Players
who
are
new
to
the
game
and
thereby
lack
experience
tend
to
die
more
often
and
more
easily
to
skilled
players.
Feeding
is
also
a
vicious
circle.
Every
time
he
kills,
the
killer
gets
stronger
and
is
thereby
even
harder
to
defeat
next
time.
This
may
result
in
a
spiral
downwards
where
the
gap
between
the
champion
levels
and
equipment
becomes
wider
with
each
kill,
and
thereby
diminishes
the
chances
of
the
killed
champion
to
get
back
on
the
level
of
the
other
champions.
Besides
non-intentional
feeders,
there
are
also
Griefers.
Griefers
are
intentional
feeders
who
die
on
purpose
in
order
to
actively
feed
the
enemy
team.
They
either
do
it
in
order
to
speed
up
the
game's
process
if
they
do
not
see
any
chance
to
win
anymore
and
the
surrender
vote
failed,
or
simply
to
ruin
other
player's
games.
Since
griefers
usually
lead
their
team
into
sure
defeat,
griefers
are
more
likely
to
be
found
in
very
low
level
matches
and
become
more
rare
on
the
higher
level
matches.
Griefing
is
reportable
.
Destructive
criticism
towards
new
players
is
against
the
summoner's
code
,
but
still
a
very
common
way
to
react
to
any
kind
of
feeding.
Though
it
surely
is
frustrating
to
have
a
new
player
who
feeds
the
enemy
team,
ranting
at
them
does
not
help
and
is
considered
bad
manners.
Role
or
Grief
In
the
champion
select,
griefers
can
say
their
prefered
role
(ex.
Mid
or
Feed).
If
the
griefer
doesn't
get
the
role
that
he
or
she
wanted
to
be
in,
they
can
intentionally
feed
the
enemy
team
and
can
ruin
the
match
to
prevent
the
griefers
team
to
win.
Trivia
The
term
stems
from
the
more
common
meaning
of
the
word
"feed";
to
gain
nourishment
by
eating
something.
In
this
case,
the
'food'
is
an
enemy
champion.
