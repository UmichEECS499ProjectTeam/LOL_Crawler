Lore
Snowy
slopes,
cold
winds,
and
scarce
sources
of
food
makes
Mount
Targon
a
harsh
landscape
for
survival.
The
mountain
can
be
seen
all
across
Valoran,
and
many
believe
its
peak
to
be
the
highest
point
on
Runeterra
.
Pantheon
in
battle
The
Rakkor
Tribe
Far
above
the
clouds
on
Mount
Targon
resides
a
stalwart
tribe
of
people
known
as
the
Rakkor
who
still
revere
combat
and
war
as
ultimate
artforms.
They
live
and
breathe
only
for
battle.
Each
member
of
the
tribe
is
bred
to
be
a
disciplined
and
vicious
warrior,
preferring
to
battle
soldiers
of
either
the
Noxian
or
Demacian
armies
only
when
outnumbered
at
least
ten
to
one.
Rakkor
warriors
are
trained
not
only
to
be
as
lethal
with
their
bare
hands
as
the
most
capable
martial
artists,
but
also
to
fiercely
wield
the
many
relic-weapons
of
the
tribe.
Such
treasures
have
been
handed
down
from
generation
to
generation,
and
have
harnessed
the
mystical
nature
of
Runeterra
in
their
very
cores.
These
relic-weapons
are
among
the
most
dangerous
in
existence.
The
stone-faced
warrior
Pantheon,
the
Artisan
of
War
,
is
considered
the
paragon
of
his
people.
Before
the
solstice
of
their
16th
year,
each
member
of
the
Rakkor
tribe
must
participate
in
the
Rite
of
Kor,
a
ceremony
in
which
two
Rakkor
teens
battle
to
the
death
for
the
right
to
bear
a
relic-weapon.
It
is
a
grisly
event,
though
due
to
Targon’s
limited
food
supply,
a
necessary
one.
Every
child
is
trained
and
taught
in
preparation
for
their
momentous
battle.
Should
a
participant
refuse
to
fight,
they
are
sentenced
to
death
by
the
Rakkor
leaders
and
are
immediately
executed.
The
name
of
the
current
Kor
leader
is
Jagen.
The
Solari
Tribe
Leona
emerges
Rather
than
a
pursuit
of
war,
Mount
Targon’s
peak
is
reserved
for
a
special
group
of
Rakkor
who
answer
to
a
“higher”
calling.
Members
of
this
group,
called
the
Solari,
retire
their
mantles
of
war,
choosing
instead
to
devote
their
lives
to
reverence
of
the
sun.
According
to
legend,
the
Solari
were
formed
by
a
warrior
who
could
call
the
raw
might
of
the
sun
down
upon
his
enemies
in
combat.
He
claimed
Mount
Targon’s
summit,
the
point
on
Valoran
closest
to
the
sun,
for
his
solar
devotion,
a
tradition
which
generations
of
Solari
have
preserved
to
this
day.
Though
they
maintain
their
reverence,
no
other
warrior
possessed
the
gifts
of
the
founder
–
until
Leona,
the
Radiant
Dawn
.
The
Solari
elders
claimed
Leona
from
the
Rakkor
tribe
and
assisted
in
focusing
her
abilities.
When
she
was
ready,
Leona
donned
the
golden
armor
of
the
Solari
and
they
bestowed
upon
her
the
sword
and
shield
passed
down
from
the
ancient
sun-warrior
of
legend.
Diana's
discovery
The
Heretic
Though
she
was
born
to
the
Solari,
Diana's
inquisitive
nature
set
her
apart
from
her
brethren.
She
had
always
found
solace
and
guidance
in
the
night
sky,
and
questioned
the
dominance
of
the
sun
in
her
society.
The
Solari
elders
responded
to
her
challenges
with
only
derision
and
punishment.
Diana
remained
convinced,
however,
that
if
she
could
find
evidence
of
the
moon's
power,
the
elders
would
listen
to
reason.
For
years,
she
studied
Solari
archives
in
solitude
until
she
discovered
an
encoded
message
hidden
in
an
old
tome.
This
clue
led
her
to
a
secluded
valley
on
Mount
Targon
where
she
unearthed
the
hidden
entrance
to
an
ancient,
sealed
temple.
Inside,
among
aging
relics
and
faded
murals,
she
found
an
ornate
suit
of
armor
and
a
beautiful
crescent
blade,
both
inscribed
with
sigils
of
the
moon.
Diana
donned
the
armaments
and
returned
to
the
Solari
elders
that
night.
She
declared
that
the
artifacts
proved
others
had
once
worshiped
the
moon
as
she
did.
Her
discovery
of
evidence
challenging
Solari
dominion
shocked
the
elders.
To
Diana's
horror,
they
pronounced
her
a
heretic
and
condemned
her
to
death.
As
the
elders
prepared
her
for
execution,
Diana's
anger
and
sorrow
overwhelmed
her
desire
for
acceptance.
She
lifted
her
gaze
to
the
sky,
calling
upon
the
moon
for
strength.
Lunar
power
surged
within
her
and
she
shattered
her
bindings.
Raising
her
relic
blade,
she
turned
and
slaughtered
the
elders.
With
the
temple
in
ruins
behind
her,
Diana
resolved
to
destroy
all
those
who
would
deny
the
power
of
the
moon.
Now
an
unyielding
avatar
of
the
moon's
power,
Diana
wages
a
dark
crusade
against
the
sun-worshiping
Solari.
