Ability
Details
Chum
the
Waters
is
a
collision
linear
skillshot
that

enemies
in
an
area
centered
on
the
target.
Applies
spell
effects
as
an
area
of
effect
ability.

apply
a
15%
slow.
Magic
damage
will
be
mitigated
by
Black
Shield
and
Lifeline
.
Spell
shields
will
partially
block
Chum
the
Waters
by
causing
the
fish
to
drop
to
the
ground
instead
of
latching
onto
the
target;
however,
the
shark
will
still
appear
and
deal
damage
around
the
fish
after
the
normal
delay.
Additional

will
only
attach
itself
to
an
enemy
champion
and

terrain
and
non-champion
targets.
If
the
fish
is
thrown
onto
a
target
without
an
active
spell
shield,
the
target
will
be
slowed.
If
the
spell
shield
activates
while

fish
is
already
latched
on,
the
slow
will
remain
but
the
shark's
damage
and

will
be
negated,
consuming
the
shield.

initial
slow
can
be
removed
by

the
slow
but

NOT
drop
the
fish
to
the
ground.

of
the
effects
can
hit
stealthed
units,
and
any
stealthed
unit
hit
by
the
fish
will
be
revealed
until
the
shark
appears.
Chum
the
Waters
deals
1
true
damage
every
.5
seconds
as
a
countdown
before
the
knockup
.
Chum
the
Waters'
secondary
effect
will
activate
immediately
if
it
is
attached
to
a
champion
and
they
die
prior
to
the
shark
emerging.
