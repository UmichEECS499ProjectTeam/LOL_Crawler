Lore
Zaun
is
a
city-state
both
supported
and
ruined
by
unchecked
industry,
mercantilism,
and
magic
run
amok.
The
pollution
from
the
countless
factories
and
laboratories
is
constantly
spewed
into
the
environment.
The
urban
heart
of
the
city-state
is
often
choked
with
smog
that
blocks
the
morning
sun
and
drains
the
sky
of
its
pastels.
Visitors
have
called
the
sky
the
"Zaun
Gray",
and
describe
staring
up
at
it
akin
to
seeing
the
beginnings
of
a
cosmic
disturbance.
As
polluted
as
Zaun
is
above-ground,
its
subterranean
levels
are
far
worse.
All
of
Zaun's
runoff
waste
pools
together
in
its
sewers,
mixing
together
into
toxic
and
mysterious
concoctions.
Culture
While
known
to
be
a
notoriously
self-centered
people
by
other
nations,
the
denizens
of
Zaun
collectively
take
great
pride
in
themselves
and
their
city.
To
them,
their
right
to
do
as
they
please
is
what
makes
Zaun
the
freest
city-state
on
Runeterra
.
As
a
result
the
streets
of
Zaun
are
a
constant
hive
of
activity.
Shopkeepers
with
a
variety
of
eccentric
items
can
be
found
at
every
corner
of
the
city,
with
the
dark
and
seedy
alleys
overflowing
with
ambitious
individuals
willing
to
give
their
all
for
a
profit.
It's
also
said
that
corporate
rivalry
is
the
very
spirit
of
competition
that
defines
Zaun
as
a
city-state.
Nevertheless,
both
espionage
and
sabotage
are
considered
common
practices
when
doing
business
with
Zaunites.
One
example
of
the
denizens'
love
for
freedom
of
expression
is
the
unlawful
synthesis
of
"Shimmer",
a
corrosive
techmaturgical
waste
substance
that
is
popular
among
Zaun's
rebellious
youth.
When
slathered
onto
the
skin
the
Shimmer
stimulates
intense
emotions
in
its
subject.
The
Shimmer
then
creates
an
assortment
of
shining
colors
that
corresponds
to
the
emotion
the
subject
is
feeling.
Though
frequent
application
of
the
caustic
glop
can
result
in
progressive
degeneration
of
the
skin
and
muscle
tissue,
a
rumor
that
Shimmer
can
grant
its
wearer
unnatural
abilities
has
simply
increased
its
demand.
To
cheer
for
their
favorite
League
champions
,
Zaunite
fans
can
gather
at
the
Vaskervon
Coliseum.
There
the
League
of
Legends
Visiopathic
Service
displays
key
battles
featuring
their
city-state
representatives,
such
as
the
matches
between
Zaun
and
their
rival
Ionia
(or
as
the
Zaunites
refer
to
them,
"those
peaceniks").
Afterwards
the
fans
will
gather
together
for
their
traditional
post-game
celebratory
feast.
The
citizens
of
Piltover
that
encountered
Jinx
"described
the
street
fashions
of
Zaun
in
her
dress."
Government
The
city's
governing
body,
the
liberal
Council
of
Zaun,
are
extremely
lenient
with
their
restrictions.
This
has
allowed
their
researchers
and
inventors
the
leeway
to
push
the
bounds
of
their
experiments
at
an
accelerated
rate,
for
better
or
worse.
Some
say
the
city-state
is
run
more
like
a
corporate
business
with
no
restraints
rather
than
a
society
of
law
and
order.
Zaun’s
Chief
Executive,
Chairman
Magnus
Dunderson,
is
said
to
have
had
a
relatively
long
reign.
Notable
Research
While
Zaun's
ambitious
patrons
do
much
to
advance
the
field
of
science
on
Valoran,
their
research
and
inventions
often
push
the
boundaries
of
morality
on
a
daily
basis.
The
nation
of
Zaun
is
particularly
famous
for
its
Alchemists,
who
often
alight
the
city
with
their
magical
concoctions.
Their
most
renowned
member
is
known
as
Singed,
the
Mad
Chemist
.
He
is
best
known
for
creating
genocidal
toxins
which
are
potent
enough
to
wipe
out
an
entire
village.
The
advanced
College
of
Techmaturgy
resides
in
the
city,
a
forefront
in
the
study
of
hextech
devices.
The
doctorate
students
there
are
often
credited
for
creating
the
first
intelligent
steam
automaton,
which
they
called
Blitzcrank,
the
Great
Steam
Golem
.
With
his
tremendous
knowledge
of
the
human
anatomy
and
its
tolerance
to
pain,
Dr.
Mundo,
the
Madman
of
Zaun
,
strives
to
some
day
create
the
perfect
science-enhanced
killer.
As
a
result,
there
are
few
household
pets
left
in
the
city
due
to
the
doctor's
appetite
for
live
experimentation.
Seeking
to
understand
magic
and
its
mysteries,
the
infamous
Dr.
Xavier
Rath
conducted
a
risky
experiment
that
would
give
non-magical
individuals
the
power
to
control
magic.
With
a
great
deal
of
luck
the
procedure
was
a
success
for
one
participant,
granting
Twisted
Fate,
the
Card
Master
,
the
ability
to
teleport.
Twitch,
the
Plague
Rat
,
has
publicly
stated
his
goal
to
gather
enough
of
the
materials
needed
to
recreate
the
strange
process
in
which
he
gained
his
sentience.
Were
he
to
succeed,
it
would
mean
a
bold
and
brazen
step
forward
for
the
evolution
of
life
on
Runeterra.
Through
the
joint
efforts
of
Zaunite
Professor
Stanwick
Pididly
and
the
Noxian
Bleak
Academy,
the
deceased
soldier
Urgot,
the
Headsman's
Pride
,
was
reconstructed
and
resurrected.
Urgot's
existence
represents
the
first
and
only
successful
combination
between
the
field
of
techmaturgy
and
the
art
of
necromancy.
Viktor,
the
Machine
Herald
,
is
a
techmaturgist
who
engineered
parts
to
replace
and
improve
his
own
body.
Almost
no
trace
of
the
original
man
remains.
He
became
obsessed
with
what
he
called
"the
glorious
evolution",
where
man
would
renounce
his
flesh
in
favor
of
superior
hextech
augmentations.
Zac,
the
Secret
Weapon
,
is
the
product
of
a
Zaun
experiment
to
manufacture
a
hexchem-engineered
supersoldier
–
the
Zaun
Amorphous
Combatant.
Combining
brute
strength
with
limitless
flexibility,
he
is
a
versatile
juggernaut:
a
creative
fighter
who
bounces
over
obstacles
and
pounds
his
foes
into
submission.
Ties
with
Noxus
The
city
shares
a
friendly
relationship
with
the
city-state
of
Noxus
,
where
the
Noxian
High
Command
would
often
summon
Zaunite
champions
to
fight
in
the
League
on
their
nation's
behalf.
In
addition,
Noxus
assists
Dr.
Mundo,
the
Madman
of
Zaun
,
in
his
ambition
to
create
the
perfect
science-enhanced
killer.
They
have
provided
the
doctor
a
laboratory
within
their
city
and
have
given
him
free
reign
to
pursue
his
life's
work
in
his
spare
time.
Mercenaries
from
the
city
were
also
recruited
by
Noxus
during
their
invasion
of
Ionia,
the
two
most
heinous
of
them
being
Singed,
the
Mad
Chemist
,
and
Warwick,
the
Blood
Hunter
.
The
brand
of
mass
death
and
destruction
these
two
madmen
unleashed
remains
a
festering
scar
on
Ionian
history.
When
the
necromantic
reanimation
of
Urgot,
the
Headman's
Pride
,
proved
problematic
for
Noxus
due
to
his
lifetime
of
injuries,
a
prevailing
scholar
of
Zaun
named
Professor
Stanwick
Pididly
provided
the
solution
by
forging
a
new
body
for
the
headman.
Relations
with
Piltover
As
the
two
leading
city-states
in
the
development
of
hextech,
Zaun
and
Piltover
have
a
deep
competitive
rivalry,
both
vying
to
be
the
ones
directing
the
future
of
techmaturgy
on
Runeterra.
League
matches
between
the
two
nations
have
a
tendency
to
begin
with
their
champions
exchanging
contemptuous
banter
and
moody
glares.
History
Noxian
Trade
Relations
Improve
At
the
base
of
the
Ironspike
Mountains,
along
the
main
trade
route
between
Zaun
and
Noxus,
there
lies
two
smaller
villages:
Askay
and
Meland.
For
generations
the
people
of
those
villages
had
been
embroiled
in
a
bloody
feud.
The
lawlessness
of
the
region
had
complicated
the
development
of
trade
agreements
between
the
two
city-states,
limiting
their
interaction
to
wartime
pacts
serviced
by
mercenary
contracts
and
alchemical
weapons.
However,
after
some
Noxian
intervention,
both
Askay
and
Meland
have
put
aside
their
differences
and
declared
their
allegiance
to
Noxus.
With
the
conflict
resolved,
Zaun
and
Noxus
were
now
free
to
pursue
more
thriving
peacetime
trade
relations.
The
Festival
of
Flight
Tensions
between
Piltover
and
Zaun
renewed
as
the
16th
Festival
of
Flight
race
drew
near,
marking
the
beginning
of
the
annual
Techmaturgical
Conference.
The
city
of
Zaun
had
been
named
victor
of
the
symbolic
event
for
the
last
four
years
running,
though
they
showed
a
great
deal
of
trepidation
towards
the
upcoming
match
after
Piltover
publicly
unveiled
their
new
state-of-the-art
zeppelin.
While
it's
difficult
to
classify
any
dirigible
as
small,
the
appropriately
named
“Tailwind”
aircraft
was
a
record-breaking
length
of
27
meters.
Not
only
was
it
the
first
zeppelin
to
meet
such
small
size
constraints,
but
it
also
pioneered
the
utilization
of
Piltoverian
Chrono-Technology.
The
new
prototype
“Chrono-propeller”
engine,
which
received
tremendous
design
contributions
from
fellow
League
Champion
Zilean,
the
Chronokeeper
,
was
rumored
to
manipulate
time
itself
to
reach
speeds
that
would
otherwise
be
impossible
under
Valoran’s
constantly
changing
atmospheric
conditions.
The
zeppelin
would
be
piloted
in
the
race
by
Janna,
the
Storm's
Fury
,
who
was
once
one
of
Zaun’s
most
promising
mage
talents
before
defecting
from
the
city-state
several
years
ago.
[1]
Zaun
Loses
the
Annual
Zeppelin
Race
Janna’s
record-breaking
zeppelin
“Tailwind”
defeated
the
Zaunite
flagship
“Lead
Zeppelin”
at
the
annual
Techmaturgical
Conference
in
Piltover.
Zaun’s
“Lead
Zeppelin”
had
maintained
a
strong
lead
from
the
race’s
start
in
Piltover.
The
Zaunite
flagship,
a
powerhouse
of
black
metal
and
Zaunite
techmaturgy,
had
claimed
victory
at
the
Conference
for
the
past
four
years.
As
the
two
zeppelins
crossed
the
Bluewind
Bay,
however,
Tailwind’s
chrono-propeller
engine
allowed
the
craft
to
navigate
through
the
bay's
storms
utterly
unfettered,
securing
Piltover’s
victory.
After
Tailwind
sailed
into
Piltover
hours
before
Zaun’s
Lead
Zeppelin,
Zaunite
representatives
immediately
contested
the
victory,
claiming
that
the
chrono-propeller
gave
Piltover
an
unfair
advantage.
Conference
officials,
however,
overruled
their
protest.
Warehouse
Revealed
to
be
a
Corporate
Prison
Main
article:
The
Journal
of
Justice:
Volume
1,
Issue
29
An
unassuming
Priggs
Industries
warehouse
in
Zaun
was
discovered
to
be
a
corporate
prison
when
a
breakout
from
within
revealed
a
secret
entry
point.
The
commotion
began
when
Edward
Manfred
was
overseeing
a
routine
inspection
of
his
own
warehouse
next
door.
Manfred
stated
that
he
heard
an
explosion
from
Priggs'
warehouse
and
went
to
investigate.
Manfred
reportedly
entered
the
Priggs
warehouse
to
witness
an
unidentified
man
grappling
with
a
pair
of
guards.
The
man
threw
a
smoke
grenade
of
some
sort,
and
when
the
haze
cleared,
the
two
guards
were
unconscious
and
the
man
had
gone.
Manfred
was
the
first
to
discover
a
passage
to
an
underground
holding
facility
that
had
been
blown
open
from
within
from
a
dynamite
blast.
Inside
was
what
appeared
to
be
a
prison,
but
one
cell
was
empty.
The
other
five
prisoners,
however,
were
quickly
released.
One
of
the
prisoners
was
discovered
to
be
Falren
Danart,
whose
disappearance
and
assumed
death
three
years
ago
was
thought
to
be
the
cause
of
his
father's
failed
management
and
subsequent
bankruptcy
of
the
famed
Danart
Chemicals,
a
once-rival
company
to
Priggs
Industries.
With
Falren's
freedom,
however,
Danart
immediately
came
forward
to
state
that
he
was
blackmailed
following
his
son's
capture
and
imprisonment.
As
this
information
has
become
available,
the
estimated
value
of
Priggs
Industries
has
plummeted
in
Zaun.
Other
warehouses
under
the
Priggs
name
have
been
searched,
primarily
by
forces
under
Manfred,
though
no
other
holding
facilities
have
been
discovered.
Production
at
Priggs
factories
has
all
but
shut
down
as
employees
are
questioned.
Dr.
Priggs
himself,
however,
has
vanished
from
the
public
eye.
Unbeknowingly
to
the
public,
he
was
executed
by
Graves
after
revealing
information
of
his
whereabouts.
The
Herald
and
the
Defender
After
Viktor
stole
the
Arcane
Crystal
from
Piltover,
Jayce
invaded
his
lab
and
defeated
his
acolytes.
He
made
his
way
into
the
heart
of
the
lab
where
Viktor
had
used
the
crystal's
energy
to
fuel
his
automatons.
They
both
fought
fiercely
and
both
had
suffered
severe
injuries.
In
the
end,
Jayce
managed
a
desperate
strike
at
the
crystal.
He
shattered
it
and
escaped
as
Viktor's
machines
erupted
in
flames.
Trivia
In
the
lore,
the
Twisted
Treeline
was
the
last
living
forest
of
Zaun.
It
has
since
been
retroactively
relocated
to
the
Shadow
Isles
as
of
Patch
V1.0.0.150
