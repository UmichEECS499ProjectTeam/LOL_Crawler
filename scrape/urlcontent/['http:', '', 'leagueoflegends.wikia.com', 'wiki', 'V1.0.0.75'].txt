with
the

scaling
based
on
the
delta
of

The
scaling
is
based
on
an
S
curve
so
that
killing
champions
three

rewards,

three
levels
and
above
provide
almost
twice
the
experience
of

lock

several
issues
with

the
visual
quality
of
many
abilities.
Fixed
a
bug
that
would
show
your
champion
under
the
"
Assist
"
section
in
Death
Recap
in
some
cases.
Changed
Death
Recap
to
not
report
tower
damage
as
champion
damage
(this
will
not
affect
Kill
/
Assist
crediting).
Fixed
several
bugs
with
Death
Recap
that
were
causing
Udyr's
stances
to
not
report
damage
correctly.
Pressing
the
"Esc"
key
should
unselect
a
controlled
pet.
Buff
stacks
should
show
the
stack
count
in
the
HUD
now
without
having
to
mouse
over
them.
Fixed
a
bug
that
was
causing
/surrender
fail
for
some
users
in
some
circumstances.
