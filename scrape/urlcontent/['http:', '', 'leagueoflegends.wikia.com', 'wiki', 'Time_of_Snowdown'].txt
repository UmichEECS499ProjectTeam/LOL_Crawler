The
Time
of
Snowdown
is
a
Special
Celebration
of
the
Valoran
people
to
commemorate
the
passing
of
one
year
to
the
next.
Lore
For
countless
years,
the
citizens
of
Valoran
have
celebrated
the
end
of
the
calendar
year
in
numerous
ways.
Even
while
the
Rune
Wars
raged
their
fiercest,
most
people
still
reserved
time
to
celebrate
the
passing
of
one
year
into
the
next.
Each
city-state
observes
this
holiday–
known
as
the
Time
of
Snowdown
–
in
its
own
unique
way.
The
yordles
of
Bandle
City
prioritize
merriment
and
indulgence,
throwing
week-long
banquets
and
feasting
on
roasted
meats
and
sweet
liquors.
Demacia
observes
the
Time
of
Snowdown
with
a
strong
sense
of
reverence,
hosting
grand
ceremonies
which
commemorate
the
past
year’s
fallen
heroes.
Even
the
insidious
Noxians
honor
the
Snowdown
with
surprising
gentility
by
offering
clemency
to
select
prisoners
of
non-violent
crimes.
The
people
of
Valoran
venerate
the
Time
of
Snowdown
with
such
devotion
for
reasons
rooted
in
history
of
the
world.
Many
parts
of
Runeterra
have
always
suffered
bitter,
merciless
winters;
this
is
especially
true
on
Valoran
after
the
devastation
wrought
upon
the
world
by
the
Rune
Wars.
Valoran’s
inhabitants
have
historically
ceased
their
political
squabbles
to
band
against
the
greater
threat
of
nature
run
amok.
Countless
tales
of
yore
recount
instances
of
sworn
enemies
easing
their
hostilities
with
one
another
in
order
to
share
in
lavish
feasts
or
to
allow
soldiers
a
chance
to
return
home
briefly.
In
modern
times,
the
League
of
Legends
continues
the
ancient
traditions
by
adopting
the
holiday
as
a
time
of
revelry
–
both
to
celebrate
the
peace
that
the
League
brings
to
Valoran
and
as
a
way
of
giving
back
to
the
city-states
that
granted
the
League
its
unique
position
of
power
in
the
world.
League
embassies
in
each
city-state
are
made
open
to
the
public,
and
feature
three
week
festivals
to
which
all
are
welcome.
The
Institute
of
War
holds
an
exclusive
month-long
celebration,
and
invites
distinguished
guests
from
all
across
the
continent.
Special
runes
are
forged
and
awarded
to
exemplary
summoners.
Great
celebratory
scrimmages
are
held
in
the
Fields
of
Justice,
culminating
in
an
epic
battle
royale
amongst
the
League's
most
powerful
summoners
.
The
League
calls
this
celebration
the
Snowdown
Showdown
.
