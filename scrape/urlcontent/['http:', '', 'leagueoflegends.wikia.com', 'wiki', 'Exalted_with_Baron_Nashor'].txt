Exalted

Baron
Nashor
This
unit's
health
and
mana
are
regenerating,
and
they
enjoy
increased
attack
damage
and
ability
power.

Exalted
with
Baron
Nashor
is
a
buff
available
only
on
Summoner's
Rift
.
The
buff
can
be
identified
by
swirling
violet
runes
around
the
champion.
The
buff
grants:
Up
to
40
ability
power
Up
to
40
attack
damage
3%
of
your
maximum
health
in
health
regeneration
per
5
sec.
1%
of
your
maximum
mana
in
mana
regeneration
per
5
sec.
Due
to
the
large
boost
this
buff
gives,
it
can
often
turn
the
tide
of
a
match.
It
can
also
put
the
team
who
has
the
buff
in
favor
when
poking
around
a
turret
as
they
have
high
amounts
of
regeneration
while
the
other
team
does
not.
Notice
that
Runic
Affinity
doesn't
affect
this
buff's
duration.
How
to
get
On
Summoner's
Rift
,
by
killing
Baron
Nashor
(from
which
its
name
is
derived).
After
Baron
Nashor
is
slain,
the
buff
is
given
to
all
living
players
on
the
team.
Unlike
most
other
monster
buffs,
this
buff
is
not
transferrable:
the
buff
is
lost
when
a
champion
carrying
it
is
killed.
Trivia
This
buff's
in-game
icon
is
the
same
as
the
one
used
for
Kassadin's
Null
Sphere
.
The
name
Nashor
is
an
anagram
and
derived
from
a
similar
neutral
monster
in
DotA
named
Roshan.
