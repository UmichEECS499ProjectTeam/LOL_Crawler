Efficiency
Tiamat
is
gold
efficient
even
without
its
passive
and
active.
Builds
Ravenous
Hydra
Notes
Cleave
has
a
radius
of
~385;
Crescent
has
a
radius
of
400.
[2]
Cleave
is
centered
on
the
target;
Crescent
is
centered
on
the
user.
Activating
Crescent
does
not
reset
the
auto-attack
timer.
Rather,
the
effect
uses
the
champion's
auto
attack
animation
to
display
the
effect.
Crescent
casts
faster
as
you
gain
more
attack
speed.
This
item
shares
the
Cleave
and
Crescent
effects
with
Ravenous
Hydra
.
This
item's
passive
and
active
cannot
be
used
by
ranged
champions.
Shapeshifting
champions
can
only
use
Cleave
and
Crescent
while
classified
as
melee.
This
includes
Kayle
,
who
is
considered
a
ranged
champion
while
Righteous
Fury
is
active,
Nidalee
when
using
Aspect
of
the
Cougar
,
Jayce
while
in
Hammer
stance
,
Elise
while
in
Spider
Form
,
and
Quinn
while
her
ultimate
Tag
Team
is
activated.
Cleave's
damage
is
based
on
the
attack
damage
champion
statistic
,
not
from
actual
damage
dealt
on
the
attack—it
therefore
doesn't
benefit
from
critical
strikes
or
on-hit
effects
Cleave
from
Tiamat
does
not
trigger
on-hit
effects
or
life
steal.
Cleave's
and
Crescent's
damage
procs
The
Black
Cleaver's
passive
effect,
which
is
not
an
on-hit.
Cleave
will
not
trigger
if
it
has
triggered
on
a
different
target
in
the
last
0.
05
seconds.
[3]
This
affects
abilities
such
as
Shyvana's
Twin
Bite
(Dragon
form).
There
is
no
cooldown
on
triggering
the
effect
on
a
single
target,
such
as
Double
Strike
or
Shyvana's
Twin
Bite
(Human
Form).
Parrrley
procs
Tiamat
as
well
as
Ravenous
Hydra
despite
the
fact
that
the
ability
has
a
range.
Using
Gangplank's
Parrrley
with
Tiamat
will
give
you
extra
gold
for
every
single
minion
killed
with
Tiamat's
passive
effect.
Trivia
In
Babylonian
mythology,
Tiamat
was
the
first
dragon
and
was
slain
to
make
the
heavens,
earth,
and
man.
In
the
V1.0.0.115
April
Fools
day
patch
Tiamat
was
renamed
to
Tamat
,
the
name
of
a
Rioter.
Tiamat
is
also
the
name
of
the
five
headed
dragon
goddess
in
the
Dungeons
And
Dragons
RPG.
This
item
is
very
similar
to
the
DotA
item
Battlefury
:
both
requires
2
attack
damage
items
and
2
regeneration
items
to
build
(althrough
Battlefury
have
mana
regeneration
rather
than
a
second
health
regeneration)
and
both
gives
area
of
effect
damage
on
autoattack
for
melee
only.
