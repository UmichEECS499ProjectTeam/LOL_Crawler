Please
note
the
following:
Movement
includes
abilities
(such
as
Ezreal's
Arcane
Shift
).
For
example,
while
airborne
you
can
cast
all
summoner
spells
except
Flash
and
Teleport
.
Ability
refers
to
a
champion's
castable
spells
(by
default
Q,
W,
E
and
R).
Mikael's
Crucible
cannot
be
activated
where
Abilities
are
disabled,
as
the
item
is
intended
to
be
used
on
allies.
Spells
refers
to
the
Summoner
Spells
.
Interrupt
refers
to
whether
or
not
the
effect
will
cancel
channeled
abilities.
Contrary
to
popular
belief,
Roots
and
Entangles
will
NOT
interrupt
channeling
.
This
is
with
the
exception
of
two
special-cases:
Teleport
and
Shen's
Stand
United
.
Roots
and
Entangles
will,
however,
interrupt
charged
abilities
(namely
Elastic
Slingshot
,
Vault
Breaker
and
Piercing
Arrow
).
Mercurial
Scimitar
removes
any
crowd
control
effect
that
Quicksilver
Sash
would.

Types
of
Crowd
Control
Airborne
The
target
is
unable
to
control
movement,
attack
or
cast
abilities.
The
target
remains
targetable
and
will
be
affected
by
abilities
as
if
they
were
on
the
ground
(such
as
Miasma
).
The
duration
of
the
effect
is
related
to
how
long
the
target
is
in
the
air.
A
common
bug
where
a
target
who
is
dashing
is
made
airborne
causes
them
to
be
knocked
"into
orbit".
The
duration
is
largely
extended
due
to
the
increased
distance
the
target
has
to
fall.
Interrupts
the
channeling
of
abilities.
Interrupts
dash
abilities.
The
duration
is
unaffected
by
crowd
control
reduction.
The
effect
cannot
be
removed
by
any
means.

target
is
made
airborne
in
a
direction

Blind
The
target
will
miss
auto-attacks,
incurring
the
message
"Miss"
above
their
attack
target.
Blind
only
mitigates
the
physical
damage
portion
of
an
attack,
including
physical
damage
sourced
from
a
physical
on-hit
effect.
Other
damage
types
and
effects
won't
miss.
See:
On-hit
effects
.
Abilities
that
apply
on-hit
effects
will
also
miss.
Blind
is
considered
a
form
of
damage
mitigation.
As
such,
it
is
applied
after
Thornmail
's
passive.
Does
not
interrupt
channeling.
The
duration
is
affected
by
crowd
control
reduction.

Crucible).
Blind
will
not
affect
certain
champion
abilities.(e.g.
Riven
's
passive
Runic
Blade
)
Blinded
enemies
will
only
miss
if
they
attack
while
blinded.
Ranged
units
will
still
hit
if
the
projectile
fires
before
the
blind.
If
Vayne
is
blinded,
she
can
only
proc
her
Silver
Bolts
if
she
tumbles.
Normal

attacks
do
not
proc
silver
bolts
while
blinded
(tested)

not
prevent
delayed
teleports

such
as
