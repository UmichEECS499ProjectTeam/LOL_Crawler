Gangplank
Champion
Background
Strategy
Skins
&
Trivia
Skill
usage
Gangplank
is
an
excellent
fighter
in
1v1
situations
due
to
his
high
single
target
damage
output
and
CC
removal.
Always
look
for
players
out
of
position.
Do
not
underestimate
Parrrley's
gold
bonus
when
used
for
farming
instead
of
harassment
in
early
game.
Remove
Scurvy
can
allow
him
to
stay
in
the
lane
for
an
extended
period
of
time.
Remove
Scurvy
will
cancel
suppression
e.g.
Nether
Grasp
and
Infinite
Duress
,
though
Malzahar's
Nether
Grasp
still
does
damage
after
the
suppression
is
cancelled.
In
a
desperate
laning
situation,
Gangplank
has
a
lot
of
ability
to
just
stay
in
lane
and
farm
as
much
as
possible.
Parrrley's
range
and
mana
cost
reduction
upon
last-hits
allow
Gangplank
to
farm
even
with
the
enemy
efforts
to
completely
zone
him,
building
gold
per
10
items
let
him
stay
in
the
game
despite
the
enemy
controlling
the
lane,
Cannon
Barrage
and
Raise
Morale
can
be
used
to
quickly
aid
allies
even
if
you
are
pushed
to
your
turret,
and
Remove
Scurvy
sustains
you
against
enemy
harassment.
This
strategy
would
prefer
maxing
Raise
Morale
for
the
attack
damage
bonus
to
better
allow
you
to
last-hit
under
your
turret,
with
Remove
Scurvy
as
necessary
to
sustain
and
stay
in
lane.
Leveling
up
Parrrley
first
in
this
situation
is
unpreferable
due
to
the
mana
cost
increase
while
the
gold
bonus
increase
is
less
useful
than
simply
casting
Parrrley
again
and
gaining
another
last-hit,
or
having
more
attack
damage
from
Raise
Morale
to
gain
more
last-hits
underneath
the
turret
while
Parrrley
can
be
on
cooldown.
Raise
Morale
can
be
used
defensively
and
offensively,
to
be
able
to
move
fast
for
both,
and
have
extra
damage
for
the
latter.
Gangplank's
spells
have
considerable
animation
times.
Take
this
into
account
when
you
plan
on
using
Raise
Morale
or
Remove
Scurvy
to
escape
a
pursuer.
Use
Raise
Morale
when
pushing
a
tower.
This
can
quickly
give
you
and
your
allies
the
boost
you
need
to
take
down
buildings,
effectively
allowing
you
and
your
team
to
rush
towers
and
your
enemies
not
having
enough
time
to
defend
it.
Cannon
Barrage
can
be
used
across
the
map.
You
can
help
out
in
ganks/teamfights
elsewhere,
by
assisting
with
the
damage
and
massive
AoE
slow.
Paying
attention
to
low
health
enemies
on
the
map
can
land
you
a
surprise
kill
with
Cannon
Barrage
.
Try
placing
Cannon
Barrage
in
the
path
of
fleeing
enemies
to
cut
them
off.
Cannon
Barrage
can
save
a
turret
surrounded
by
minions,
with
some
luck.
Working
as
a
team
with
other
AoE
abilities
synergizes
with
your
ultimate
Cannon
Barrage
,
such
as
Nunu's
Absolute
Zero
,
Rumble's
The
Equalizer
,
Miss
Fortune's
Bullet
Time
,
Galio's
Idol
of
Durand
,
Jarvan
IV's
Cataclysm
or
Ziggs's
Mega
Inferno
Bomb
.
The
Rage
passive
granted
by
Phage
or
Trinity
Force
will
activate
if
Cannon
Barrage
damages
an
enemy,
meaning
that
dropping
Cannon
Barrage
into
a
teamfight
early
can
help
you
arrive
there
faster.
Build
usage
Because
Parrrley
applies
on
hit
effects
like
Frozen
Mallet
,
The
Black
Cleaver
,
Sheen
,
in
addition
to
his
own
Grog
Soaked
Blade
,
they
are
all
useful
items
.
Even
though
Raise
Morale
offers
Gangplank
some
additional
attack
damage
,
its
duration
is
very
short
compared
to
its
cooldown.
More
attack
damage
items
should
be
added
to
compliment
it.
The
Bloodthirster
is
a
strong
offensive
item
.
Because
Parrrley
benefits
from
critical
strike
,
critical
strike
chance
and
damage
items
are
very
strong.
Avarice
Blade
,
Zeal
,
and
Infinity
Edge
will
help
maximize
your
damage
output.
Pure
critical
strike
builds,
although
popular,
leave
Gangplank
fairly
squishy.
Though
there
is
potential
for
high
DPS,
the
heavy
cost
of
low
survivability
including
Gangplank's
considerably
low
base
armor
and
magic
resistance
makes
it
less
than
viable.
If
focused
on
farming
and
a
strong
late
game,
Gangplank's
gold
from
Parrrley
is
complimented
by
gold
per
10
items
such
as
Avarice
Blade
,
which
grants
a
respectable
amount
of
critical
strike
chance
and
can
be
built
into
Youmuu's
Ghostblade
and
Statikk
Shiv
later
on.
'Tankplank'
builds
are
very
effective,
offering
survivability
and
a
chance
for
Gangplank
to
fully
utilize
his
skillset.
It
also
allows
Gangplank
to
increase
his
DPS
as
he
builds
towards
an
Infinity
Edge
.
Atma's
Impaler
along
with
Warmog's
Armor
are
very
effective
for
a
tanky-DPS
Gangplank
.
Trinity
Force
is
an
excellent
core
item
on
Gangplank
,
since
Trinity
Force
's
bonus
damage
proc
and
speed-up
proc
all
apply
to
Parrrley
as
well
as
providing
extra
critical
strike
chance
and
movement
speed
which
heavily
increases
Gangplank's
damaging
and
chasing
capabilities.
Because
Trinity
Force
and
Infinity
Edge
come
at
high
costs,
one
might
have
to
decide
between
Infinity
Edge
or
Trinity
Force
as
the
primary
source
of
damage
in
a
tanky
build.
A
Frozen
Mallet
and
Phantom
Dancer
could
be
a
useful
alternative
to
Trinity
Force
but
at
an
even
higher
cost.
Cooldown
reduction
items
are
fairly
effective
on
Gangplank
as
most
of
his
abilities
(
Remove
Scurvy
,
Raise
Morale
,
and
Cannon
Barrage
)
have
long
cooldowns
and
they
also
allow
Gangplank
to
use
Parrrley
as
often
as
possible.
The
unique
combination
of
stats
in
Zeke's
Herald
or
Youmuu's
Ghostblade
can
make
it
worth
an
item
slot.
Gangplank
is
effective
at
jungling,
though
some
runes
are
required
to
complete
it.
Jungle
Gangplank
is
based
upon
building
Spirit
of
the
Elder
Lizard
and
using
Cannon
Barrage
to
gain
bonus
gold
by
assisting
lanes
without
ganking.
This
allows
Gangplank
to
spend
a
significant
amount
of
time
farming
the
jungle
without
missing
opportunities
to
score
assists
or
kills
thanks
to
his
high
mobility.
If
you
find
Gangplank's
mana
issues
especially
troublesome,
consider
buying
an
early
Tear
of
the
Goddess
and
building
it
into
Manamune
later
on.
This
is
only
recommended
if
you
can
keep
up
with
your
build.
The
extra
2100
gold
cost
may
slow
your
build
down
early
game
if
you
can't
farm
up
well,
or
if
your
lane
opponent
gets
the
advantage.
AP
Gangplank,
while
an
unconventional
build,
can
make
him
difficult
to
kill
and
add
a
surprising
amount
of
damage
to
his
Cannon
Barrage
.
Lich
Bane
effectively
adds
a
.75
AP
ratio
in
compensation
for
lack
of
crits
and
his
Remove
Scurvy
will
heal
for
much
more.
AP
health
items
such
as
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
and
Rod
of
Ages
would
also
help
his
survivability.
Since
his
Parrrley
is
classified
as
an
on-hit
effect,
Liandry's
Torment
will
not
apply,
thus
only
his
Cannon
Barrage
would
benefit
from
it,
though
the
two
have
good
synergy.

Countering
Laning
against
Gangplank
can
be
a
bit
frustrating.
Parrrley
has
a
fairly
short
cooldown
and
deals
a
lot
of
damage
at
early
if
it
crits.
Starting
with
Cloth
Armor
and
5
Health
Potions
will
give
you
a
lot
of
sustain
and
damage
reduction
to
deal
with
this.
Gangplank's
Remove
Scurvy
is
very
annoying
to
the
casters
that
rely
on
crowd
control
to
utilize
their
full
combo.
Save
your
hard
crowd
control
until
after
he
uses
Remove
Scurvy
.
Champions
with
multiple
crowd
control
abilities,
namely
Blitzcrank
,
can
significantly
slow
down
Gangplank
,
despite
his
Remove
Scurvy
.
Since
this
ability
only
removes
the
current
debuff
,
one
can
use
a
"soft"
CC
ability
(such
as
a
slow)
to
force
him
to
use
Remove
Scurvy
,
then
utilize
their
"hard"
CC
(such
as
a
stun
or
suppress)
to
really
begin
harassing
him.
Also
keep
in
mind
that
AOE
or
constantly-reapplied
CC
(such
as
Yorick's
Omen
of
Pestilence
or
Miss
Fortune's
Make
It
Rain
)
are
reapplied
immediately
after
being
removed,
so
with
Remove
Scurvy's
cast
time
ends
up
actually
taking
longer
to
get
past.
Airborne
CC
(knockups/knockbacks,
pulls)
cannot
be
cleansed,
so
CC
from
Alistar,
Aatrox,
and
Blitzcrank
are
not
countered.
Although
his
early
harassment
is
strong,
Gangplank
is
fairly
squishy
in
laning
phase.
Putting
an
aggressive
pressure
on
his
lane
will
weaken
his
strong
mid/late
game.
Parrrley
does
average
damage
early
game,
but
it
will
become
quite
effective
late
game,
once
he
has
built
crit
chance
or
on-hits.
Try
making
him
build
defensively
instead
of
desirably
towards
offensive
output.
Cannon
Barrage
has
a
huge
AoE
and
global
range.
Quickly
avoid
the
AoE
if
he
uses
it
when
you
are
escaping.
Be
aware
of
its
potential
to
appear
at
any
time/location.
Countering
Gangplank
requires
starving
him
of
his
farm,
get
an
early
advantage
by
pushing
him
out
of
the
lane,
and
forcing
him
to
play
with
more
risk
than
he
would
usually
like.
Teams
should
also
consider
prioritizing
him
as
a
target
for
ganks
and
in
team
fights
depending
on
his
build
and
his
allies.
Being
aware
of
his
Remove
Scurvy
would
give
you
an
advantage
if
your
kit
has
enough
cc
compared
to
the
ability's
fairly
long
cooldown.
Casting
a
minor
cc
skill
would
force
a
Gangplank
to
use
this
ability
and
press
your
damage
as
much
as
possible
within
the
interval
of
his
