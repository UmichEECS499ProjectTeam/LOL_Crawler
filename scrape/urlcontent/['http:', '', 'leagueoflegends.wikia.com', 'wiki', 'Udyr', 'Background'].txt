Udyr
is
more
than
a
man;
he
is
a
vessel
for
the
untamed
power
of
four
primal
animal
spirits.
When
tapping
into
the
spirits'
bestial
natures,
Udyr
can
harness
their
unique
strengths:
the
tiger
grants
him
speed
and
ferocity,
the
turtle
resilience,
the
bear
might,
and
the
phoenix
its
eternal
flame.
With
their
combined
power,
Udyr
can
turn
back
all
those
who
would
attempt
to
harm
the
natural
order.
In
the
Freljord
,
there
is
a
unique
caste
that
lives
outside
the
society
of
those
savage
lands.
They
are
the
custodians
of
the
natural
world:
the
Spirit
Walkers.
Once
a
generation,
a
child
is
born
under
a
blood
red
moon,
a
child
said
to
live
between
the
two
worlds
of
spirit
and
man.
This
child
is
brought
to
the
Spirit
Walker
to
continue
the
shamanic
line.
Udyr
was
such
a
child,
and
knew
the
howl
of
the
tundra
wolves
even
before
he
learned
the
language
of
his
ancestors.
Through
the
Spirit
Walker,
Udyr
would
one
day
learn
the
meaning
of
the
spirits
calls
and
tend
to
the
balance
of
nature.
The
Spirit
Walker
often
told
Udyr
he
would
be
tested
more
than
those
who
had
come
before
him,
for
the
spirits
of
the
Freljord
were
growing
ever
more
restless,
though
the
reason
remained
clouded.
The
answer
arrived
in
the
dead
of
winter,
as
Udyr
and
the
Spirit
Walker
were
descended
upon
by
a
fearsome
figure
known
only
through
frightened
whispers:
the
Ice
Witch.
Knowing
the
boy
would
fall
easy
prey
to
her
vile
magic,
the
Spirit
Walker
shielded
the
child
from
her
assault
at
the
cost
of
his
own
life.
Wracked
by
grief,
Udyr
howled
with
fury,
and
he
felt
the
Freljord
itself
howl
with
him.
In
that
moment,
the
child
embraced
the
spirits
primal
nature
and
became
a
beast
himself.
Coursing
with
their
untamed
power,
Udyr's
angry
roar
shook
the
mountaintops
and
brought
down
a
torrential
avalanche.
Once
Udyr
had
finally
clawed
his
way
out
of
the
frost,
the
Ice
Witch
was
nowhere
to
be
found.
For
years,
the
tribes
of
the
north
learned
to
avoid
the
wildman
and
his
domain.
Then
one
day,
Udyr
caught
the
scent
of
a
fearless
trespasser.
Determined
to
chase
the
intruder
from
his
territory,
he
attacked,
only
to
be
deflected
with
ease.
The
wildman
launched
himself
at
the
stranger
again
and
again,
only
to
be
effortlessly
cast
aside
each
time.
Exhausted
and
defeated,
Udyr
felt
his
animosity
ebb
and
croaked
a
clumsy
"who"
to
the
stranger.
Lee
Sin
had
come
seeking
the
Spirit
Walker's
guidance
and
instead
found
a
man
who
had
also
lost
his
way.
The
monk
promised
he
would
right
Udyr's
path
and
guided
him
to
a
monastery
said
to
be
protected
by
four
eternal
spirits
of
great
power
and
wisdom.
There,
Udyr
would
find
harmony.
Lee
Sin
brought
Udyr
to
a
land
that
was
a
stark
contrast
to
his
birthplace.
Survival
was
not
the
only
law
that
governed
the
lives
of
Ionians
or
creatures
of
the
land.
For
the
first
time,
Udyr
felt
at
peace
with
the
spirits
surrounding
him
and
found
comfort
in
human
companionship.
His
time
among
the
monks
taught
him
to
temper
his
instincts,
while
his
meditations
with
the
ancient
temple
spirits
taught
him
wisdom.
Through
them
both,
Udyr
learned
to
truly
embrace
his
life
as
the
next
Spirit
Walker.
Udyr
owed
much
to
the
Ionians.
It
was
a
debt
he
was
never
asked
to
honor,
but
one
he
would
ultimately
repay
many
times
over.
When
the
armies
of
Noxus
invaded,
Udyr
did
not
stand
idle
as
the
brutal
soldiers
oppressed
the
peaceful
Ionians
-
he
had
not
forgotten
how
to
bare
his
teeth.
Udyr
leapt
at
their
armies
with
all
the
ferocity
of
a
cornered
beast
and
gave
the
invaders
good
reason
to
fear
the
wilderness.
From
the
trees,
his
claws
tore
the
Noxians
down
in
scores;
on
the
river
banks,
he
threw
them
back
with
the
falling
tides,
and
in
the
fields,
he
consumed
them
with
searing
wildfire.
Only
when
the
Noxians
fled
with
their
tails
between
their
legs
did
Udyr
quell
his
rage.
Peace
returned
to
Ionia,
but
still
Udyr
felt
something
stirring
him
from
his
rest.
The
spirits
of
the
Freljord
called
out
to
him,
warning
of
an
unnatural
evil
emerging
from
the
ice.
Udyr
understood
the
true
threat
that
the
Ice
Witch
posed
to
his
homeland:
she
was
the
herald
of
a
greater
darkness
that
would
soon
envelop
the
land.
Armed
with
the
potent
spirits
of
the
temple,
Udyr
returned
to
the
Freljord,
seeking
to
defend
the
natural
world
from
all
who
would
threaten
its
balance.
"Through
us,
nature's
will
is
done."
―
Udyr
The
mystics
of
Ionia
delve
into
the
deepest
mysteries
of
Valoran
,
pioneering
the
most
inner
depths
of
spirituality.
Their
adepts
are
some
of
the
most
devout
proponents
of
enlightenment
and
harmony...
but
as
is
always
the
case,
there
are
those
who
follow
a
very
different
path.
Born
in
a
grassy
clearing
under
a
red
moon,
Udyr
has
always
been
compelled
by
the
primal
drive
within
him.
His
will
was
not
untempered,
simply
undomesticated.
As
a
boy,
he
toiled
on
his
father's
farm,
but
he
felt
a
much
deeper
connection
with
the
mustangs
that
would
graze
in
the
distant
fields
than
with
the
townsfolk
who
would
visit.
Oftentimes
he
was
dragged
into
the
house
at
night
with
a
swat
and
a
scolding
when
his
parents
would
find
him
sleeping
beneath
the
stars.
On
the
day
of
his
sixteenth
birthday,
Udyr
bade
his
family
farewell
and
struck
a
path
to
the
east,
determined
to
shed
the
trappings
of
civilized
society.
Freed
of
the
shackles
of
cultural
expectations,
Udyr
tapped
into
a
well
of
inner
ferocity
he
hadn't
known
before.
His
feral
senses
roiled
to
the
surface
and
he
let
them
overcome
him.
It
was
at
this
point
in
his
life
that
Udyr
truly
lost
his
humanity.
Poachers
and
travelers
who
entered
his
territory
did
so
at
terrible
risk,
and
rarely
managed
to
leave
it.
A
monk
on
a
long
journey
passed
through
his
woods
one
day,
and
Udyr
decided
to
scare
him,
leaping
from
a
nearby
brush.
The
monk
casually
turned
and
redirected
Udyr
to
one
side.
Udyr,
enraged,
tried
time
and
time
again
to
best
him,
but
the
monk
was
unassailable.
When
Udyr
was
exhausted,
the
monk
wordlessly
beckoned
him
to
follow,
and
together
they
walked
in
silence
to
the
Hirana
Monastery.
The
monks
there
took
him
in,
and
taught
him
to
harness
and
control
his
animalistic
fury...
most
of
the
time.

Development
Udyr
was
designed
by
Coronach
.
Udyr
is
a
martial
arts
champion
based
around
4
fighting
stances:
Tiger,
Turtle,
Bear,
and
Phoenix.
Each
form
has
an
activation
effect
and
a
persistent
effect.
The
persistent
effects
ensure
that
each
stance
fulfills
a
different
role,
while
the
activation
effects
encourage
Udyr
to
constantly
switch
as
the
battlefield
changes.
Udyr
is
a
champion
with
4
basic
abilities,
and
no
ultimate
(a
groundbreaking
skillset
in
the
League
of
Legends!),
allowing
players
to
choose
which
abilities
are
worth
maxing
out
based
on
how
the
game
has
evolved.
