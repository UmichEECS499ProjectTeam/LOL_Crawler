The
Eye
Inside
Jesters!
Jokes!
Jabbings!
Ram
Steed
your
eye
inside
the
League
of
Legends
As
promised,
I,
Ram
Steed,
have
braved
the
very
depths
of
insanity,
the
darkest
places
of
the
League
of
Legends,
to
bring
you
an
exclusive
interview
with
the
mysterious
and
deadly
Shaco
,
the
world's
first
fully-functioning
homicidal
comic.
Though
the
idea
has
chilled
me
to
the
very
bone,
I
have
searched
down
many
dark
alleys
to
finally
find
the
Demon
Jester
and
convince
him
to
answer
the
questions
that
burn
in
your
very
souls!
And
he
agreed.
Ten
questions.
No
more,
no
less.
I
go
now,
hoping
that
this
will
be
the
illuminating
experience
we
all
wish...
and
not
my
obituary.
Wish
me
luck.
10
Questions
with
Shaco
An
intimate
interview
with
Shaco,
the
Demon
Jester.
Ram
:
"Thank
you
for
agreeing
to
this
interview,
Shaco.
It's
an
honor."
Shaco
:
[Sits
quietly.
Grins.
Cleans
fingernails
with
sharp-looking
stiletto.]
Ram:
"Okay,
then.
Let's
start
with
something
everyone
wants
to
know.
Where
did
you
come
from?”
Shaco:
"I
am
not
from
this
world.
Your
summoners
brought
me
forth
from
a
world
of
shadows,
a
place
that
makes
your
Runeterra
look
like
a
child's
birthday
party.
Isn't
that
one
of
the
stories?
Or
perhaps
I
am
simply
an
assassin
gone
wrong,
wandering
Runeterra
and
perpetrating
my
Killing
Joke
on
those
who
are
most
assured
to
get
the
punchline.
That
is
another
exciting
tale
of
my
origins."
[Shaco
carves
one
hash
into
the
wooden
table
with
his
stiletto.]
Ram:
"There
are
those
who
believe
you
to
be
the
manifestation
of
humanity's
dark
urges.
In
the
Runeterra
of
today,
that
is
not
out
of
the
question.
What
do
you
have
to
say
to
that?"
Shaco:
"Would
you
like
me
to
be?
Would
that
make
you
feel
better
about
the
part
of
you
that
thrills
at
the
lives
I
end?
[pause]
Like
a
magician,
I
never
reveal
my
secrets."
[Shaco
carves
another
hash
into
the
wooden
table
with
his
stiletto.]
Ram:
"Could
you
tell
us
what
your
childhood
was
like?"
Shaco:
"I'm
still
a
child.
On
the
inside.
Can't
you
tell?
I
love
to
play."
Ram:
"Your
name
is
an
anagram
of
chaos.
Is
that
intentional?"
Shaco:
"A
Shaco
by
any
other
name
would
still
spill
blood.
Intentional
or
not,
it
fits,
no?"
[Shaco
carves
a
third
and
fourth
hash
into
the
wooden
table
with
his
stiletto.]
Ram:
"There
are
some
people
who
regard
you
as
a
role-model.
What
do
you
think
of
this?"
Shaco:
"I
don't
like
competition."
[A
fifth
hash
is
carved.]
Ram:
"You
seem
to
have
developed
a
following
with
the
ladies.
How
has
that
changed
your
life?"
Shaco:
"I'm
an
equal
opportunity
killer.
You
could
say
I
go
both
ways."
[Shaco
carves
a
sixth
hash
into
the
wooden
table
with
his
stiletto.]
Ram:
"You
definitely
have
your
very
own
finely
crafted
sense
of
humor.
What's
your
favorite
joke
these
days?"
Shaco:
“What
do
people
and
books
have
in
common?
Wherever
they're
opened,
they're
red.”
[Shaco
chuckles
and
carves
a
seventh
hash.]
Ram:
"Your
enigmatic
nature
is
part
of
your
appeal
for
many
people.
However,
do
you
have
one
great
adventure
you
could
share?"
Shaco:
"Once
upon
a
time,
there
was
a
fancy
noble
in
the
city-state
of
Noxus
.
He
was
a
wretched
man,
the
kind
of
person
that
had
done
nearly
ever
underhanded
thing
of
which
one
can
think.
However,
he
was
an
indulgent
husband
and
father.
He
was
someone
who
would
appreciate
the
punchline,
so
it
was
obvious
that
he
needed
my
Killing
Joke.
First,
I
tickled
his
wife's
funny
bone.
She
split
open
with
laughter.
Then,
I
took
his
oldest
son
for
a
romp
on
the
merry-go-round.
He
loved
it
so
much
he
never
wanted
to
leave.
Then,
I
delivered
jack-in-the-boxes
as
presents
to
his
youngest
daughter
and
infant
son.
'Pop!'
went
the
Shaco,
fondly
finding
his
way
deep
into
their
hearts.
The
noble
himself?
No
joy
for
him.
However,
certainly
did
get
the
punchline."
Ram:
"What
happened
to
him?"
Shaco:
"He
tried
to
play
on
a
rope
swing
using
his
own
neck."
[The
Demon
Jester
breaks
out
into
maniacal
laughter.
It
takes
him
a
few
minutes
to
calm
down.
Ram
shifts
uncomfortably.]
Shaco:
"Two
left.
Better
make
them
good."
Ram:
"The
legal
gray
areas
that
surround
the
League
of
Legends
have
given
you
the
ability
to
function
openly,
and
even
become
a
celebrity.
However,
you
are
wanted
for
murder
by
the
authorities
in
nearly
every
city-state
in
Valoran.
How
do
you
reconcile
the
two
seemingly
at
odds
lifestyles?"
Shaco:
[A
menace
grows
in
his
eyes.]
"I
don't
like
the
authorities
and
I
don't
think
I
like
that
question."
[Ram
barely
keeps
himself
in
his
chair.]
Ram:
"Umm...
okay...
moving
on.
Last
question,
then.
There
are
claims
that
a
high-ranking
member
of
the
League
has
established
a
relationship
with
you
and
that
you've
been
seen
together
on
a
number
of
occasions.
Can
you
confirm
or
deny
this?"
[Shaco
stares.
He
stands
up
slowly,
stiletto
in
hand.]
Shaco:
"Why
so
serious?"
Note
from
the
Editor:
Ram
Steed
was
found
two
blocks
from
where
he
conducted
this
interview.
He
had
been
stabbed
multiple
times,
the
stiletto
sticking
out
of
his
chest
with
a
note
that
read,
“An
eye
inside
Ram
Steed.”
He
was
immediately
rushed
to
the
nearest
healer.
Given
the
severity
of
his
wounds,
he
has
not
yet
regained
consciousness
and
indeed
may
not.
Our
thoughts
are
with
him.
We
will
keep
you
apprised
of
his
condition.
In
the
mean
time,
please
send
any
well
wishes
to
the
usual
place
and
we
will
make
sure
that
his
friends
and
family
receive
them.
Piracy
Strikes
Bandle
City
Merchants
Bilgewater
ruins
Bandle
City's
celebration
for
Poppy
Cpt.
Morgan
Rackham
reporting
from
Bilgewater
Relations
between
Bandle
City
and
Bilgewater
have
always
been
a
bit
dodgy
--
mostly
on
account
of
a
few
bad
apples
that
really
ought
not
to
be
flying
our
proud
colors
high.
Of
course,
after
this
last
little
tiff,
it’s
unlikely
I’ll
be
making
my
seasonal
deliveries
simply
on
account
of
my
particular
anchorage.
Here’s
the
chant.
A
barmy
bloke
by
the
name
of
Tiresias
Ellington
decided
that
he
ought
to
be
captain
of
a
little
vessel
called
the
Annabelle
Nidalee.
Trouble
is,
this
sloop
already
had
a
governer,
and
not
one
you’d
want
to
trifle
with
at
that.
You
see,
Mad
Jack
Foulweather
had
been
a
terror
of
the
high
seas
for
over
20
years.
It’s
been
said
that
he
once
stared
down
the
late,
great
Captain
Vincent
--
father
of
the
famed
pirate
Gangplank
--
after
a
dispute
following
a
game
of
Liar’s
Dice!
It’s
been
said
he
once
killed
a
man
with
nothing
but
a
teacup
after
the
poor
bloke
snatched
the
last
biscuit
at
brunch!
It’s
been
said
he
once
hung
a
man
from
the
yardarm
just
for
implying
that
he
looked
a
bit
dandy
in
stripes!
But
I
digress.
Suffice
to
say,
the
Old
Captain
wasn’t
about
to
take
this
one
lying
down.
When
he
saw
those
mutants
coming,
he
barricaded
himself
up
in
the
crew’s
mess.
Ellington
lost
nearly
twenty
hands
trying
to
make
it
through
the
door
and
nab
Old
Jack.
Not
a
bad
showing
for
a
sailor
coming
up
fast
on
being
middle
aged
if
I
do
say
so
myself.
So
after
this
little
scuffle,
Ellington
managed
to
carry
Foulweather
up
on
deck
and
tip
him
over
into
the
briny.
Of
course,
by
this
time
old
Jack
had
set
fire
to
the
Annabelle’s
store
of
Myron’s
Dark
Rum!
So
there
he
was
--
Tiresias
Ellington,
Captain
of
the
Annabelle
Nidalee;
leader
of
a
gaggle
of
scurvy
mutineers
with
not
a
drop
of
grog
to
his
name.
As
you
can
imagine,
this
left
the
New
Old
Captain
of
the
Annie
in
a
bit
of
a
pinch.
After
all,
there’s
nary
a
worse
fate
to
befall
anyone
far
from
port
than
for
the
rum
to
run
dry.
So
what
does
the
blighter
do?
He
decides
he
ought
to
nip
booze
off
the
next
vessel
that
passes
between
him
and
the
horizon.
Now,
if
it’d
been
any
other
vessel,
maybe
that
would’ve
been
fine.
Maybe
it
would
have
been
nothing
to
write
home
about,
let
alone
an
article
in
the
premier
news
publication
for
the
whole
of
Valoran
.
What
makes
this
particular
happenstance
newsworthy
is
just
who
Ellington
happened
to
rip
off.
As
serendipity
would
have
it,
this
was
a
yordle
ship,
and
not
just
any
yordle
ship.
This
particular
merchant
vessel
was
on
her
way
to
Demacia
for
a
lovely
bit
of
pompous
circumstance.
Not
that
that
mattered
to
Ellington
in
even
the
slightest.
You
see,
after
he’s
put
the
yordle
crew
off
in
the
lifeboats,
he
and
his
men
took
to
sacking
the
place
looking
for
the
ship’s
stock
of
booze.
And
what
should
they
find
after
tossing
a
few
crates
of
streamers
and
party
hats
overboard
but
a
hold
full
of
fine
Red
Rocket
Ale
and
Mothership
Porter,
some
of
the
finest
brews
in
all
of
Valoran.
Trouble
is,
this
wasn’t
just
any
beer
tanker.
This
particular
shipment
was
on
its
way
to
a
celebration
commemorating
Poppy,
the
Iron
Ambassador
's
appointment
to
service
as
envoy
between
Demacia
and
the
yordles.
And
the
shorties
weren’t
exactly
planning
on
letting
this
little
incident
go.
A
special
task
force
of
Bandle
City
Scouts
and
Megling
Commandos,
led
by
none
other
than
League
Champions
Teemo
and
Tristana
themselves,
was
dispatched
forthwith
to
see
to
the
situation.
Of
course,
on
overtaking
the
Annabel
Nidalee,
what
should
this
formidable
fighting
force
find
but
a
pack
of
drunkards
too
off
it
to
even
notice
a
warship
coming
up
off
their
starboard.
Unfortunately,
by
this
time
their
merchandise
had
either
been
imbibed
or
tossed
over
into
the
ocean,
rendering
the
yordles
more
than
a
little
sour
at
their
captives.
They’re
currently
appealing
to
the
League
of
Legends
to
solicit
reparations
from
Bilgewater
for
the
loss
of
the
goods,
along
with
spoiling
their
anniversary
plans.
Bilgewater’s
stance,
of
course,
is
that
they
aren’t
responsible
for
the
actions
of
a
few
independent
sailors.
Renovation
of
Summoner’s
Rift
Underway
Champions
flock
to
Institute
of
War
for
a
new
look
Newton
Rook
reporting
from
the
Institute
of
War
After
a
lengthy
evaluation,
the
League
has
begun
renovations
on
Summoner's
Rift
.
Crews
of
yordles
and
humans
alike
are
being
commissioned
to
analyze
and
improve
every
inch
of
the
battlefield,
including
re-landscaping
and
improving
encampments
for
indigenous
creatures.
This
move
comes
following
a
growing
list
of
complaints
from
high
profile
champions
over
past
months.
The
discontent
began
last
August
with
Garen
,
who
expressed
frustration
in
the
adjudication
wings
after
a
particularly
tough
battle:
"Justice
cannot
be
served
from
tired
and
limp
foliage.
The
brush
is
just
not
as
springy
and
lush
as
it
used
to
be."
Since
Garen’s
remarks,
several
other
champions
have
filed
official
requests
for
evaluations
of
everything
from
the
way
that
the
light
illuminates
the
battleground
to
personal
wardrobes.
"With
my
new
look
lately,
some
have
mistaken
me
for
Pantheon
,"
says
League
Champion
and
Seneschal
of
Demacia,
Xin
Zhao
.
"I
need
the
look
of
my
armaments
to
make
it
clear
that
I’m
not
anything
like
that
arrogant
barbarian."
Despite
the
increasing
number
of
complaints,
there
is
little
actual
evidence
of
deterioration
shown
by
recent
surveys.
The
magical
properties
that
regenerate
Summoner’s
Rift
over
time
do
not
appear
to
be
diminishing.
Geoffery
Ju,
Master
Summoner
in
charge
of
battle
arena
preservation
and
improvement,
made
this
statement:
“It’s
all
troll
dung.
The
magical
foundations
that
preserve
the
Fields
are
bloody
perfect.
I
put
them
there
myself!
Any
perception
of
wear
and
tear
is
nothing
but
that—perception,
and
false
to
boot.”
He
further
commented,
"I
do
know
that
even
yonkeys
get
tired
of
plodding
the
same
road
over
and
over.
Therefore,
I
am
personally
coordinating
a
full
renovation
of
not
only
the
fields
themselves,
but
an
updated
style
for
our
champions
as
well.
Kids
want
shiny,
we’ll
give
‘em
shiny."
This
statement
from
Ju
was
the
critical
endorsement
lynchpin
that
spurred
action
among
Summoner’s
Rift
groundskeepers.
In
addition,
the
announcement
of
an
upgrade
to
champion
wardrobes
is
a
welcome
surprise
to
many
fans.
The
champions
have
been
excitedly
visiting
the
Institute
of
War
to
undergo
fitting
for
new
gear
and
clothing.
"The
League
giving
everyone
makeovers
is
truly
exciting,"
Taric,
the
Gem
Knight
,
after
emerging
from
the
League
tailor
shop.
"We’ve
all
been
abiding
to
last
season’s
fashion
like
it’s
a
law
somewhere.
Red
is
clearly
out.
It’s
now
ruby
for
vigor!"
Also,
rumors
have
leaked
from
some
sources
close
to
the
project
that
new
League
employees
are
being
hired
to
take
over
the
weapons
shop.
Ju
commented
regarding
the
new
hires:
"Do
you
ever
have
those
jobs
where
there
is
that
guy
who
has
been
there
forever,
and
you’re
not
sure
what
he
really
does
anymore?
That’s
the
way
we
feel
about
our
current
shopkeeper—which
is
why
we’re
gonna
move
his
desk
over
to
weapons
storage.
Now,
the
new
couple
coming
in
is
adorable,
and
I’m
sure
the
champions
will
love
'em."
No
word
yet
on
who
the
newcomers
are.

With

Desert
?
If
so,
it
would
appear
to
have
failed,
seeing
as
how
Amumu
is
not
in
the
least
bit
evil.
Is
there
any
hope
of
finding
out
his
past?"

This
is
interesting
speculation,
Xulsigae,
although
I
have
some
reason
to
believe
that
Noxus
would
view
it
as
an
“unfounded
accusation”.
To
date,
no
investigation
has
been
undertaken
on
Noxian
soil
pertaining
to
Amumu’s
origins.
It’s
possible
that
there
may
be
something
in
the
Shurima
Desert,
but
it
is
a
vast
desert
that’s
difficult
to
cover
and
extremely
dangerous
to
travel
through.
The
League
discourages
civilians
from
venturing
south
of
the
Great
Barrier
as
entire
platoons
of
soldiers
have
been
lost
on
expeditions
there.
Regarding
hope
for
discovering
his
past,
I
thought
the
best
answer
would
come
from
Amumu
himself:
"Of
course
I
have
hope;
otherwise
I
never
would
have
found
my
way
out
of
that
pyramid.
I’m
still
looking,
and
many
people
have
helped
me
in
more
ways
than
I
can
count.
I’m
so
grateful!
One
day
I’ll
find
my
parents,
I
know
it.
I
just
hope
that
when
I
find
them,
they
will
still
want
me."
"Recent
rumors
spreading
around
Freljord
claim
that
a
tall
large
warrior
with
a
spear
who
appears
to
be
Pantheon
climbs
up
to
the
Queen
's
chamber
during
the
night.
Could
this
be
a
possible
affair
between
the
Frost
Archer
and
the
Artisan
of
War?
If
so,
what
could
the
future
hold
for
both
of
them,
her
husband
,
and
her
Kingdom
if
an
heir
is
produced
not
of
King
Tryndamere's
blood?"
–
Guiden
These
sound
like
the
typical
baseless
rumors
which
unerringly
occur
after
a
political
marriage.
Queen
Ashe
actually
spends
most
of
her
time
traveling
on
diplomatic
missions
or
on
the
Fields
of
Justice.
If
such
a
mysterious
warrior
has
been
seen
in
Freljord,
he
would
likely
be
climbing
up
to
an
empty
bed.
However,
the
greatest
evidence
that
this
is
fiction
is
the
fact
that
we
all
know
Pantheon
is
perfectly
capable
of
man-dropping
onto
the
balcony
with
a
single
leap;
no
climbing
necessary.
"Watching
many
matches,
the
legendary
Baron
Nashor
's
presence
has
confused
me.
The
creature
is
far
more
powerful
than
the
average
champion
,
to
the
point
where
it
seems
hard
to
believe
he
could
simply
be
created
by
summoning
magic
as
minions
are.
Is
Nashor
truly
a
construct,
or
is
he
something
else
entirely?
If
he
isn't
a
construct,
how
has
the
League
enlisted
the
aid
of
such
a
powerful
and
awe-inspiring
creature?"
–
Milski
The
many
neutral
monsters
on
the
Fields
of
Justice
are
constructs
inspired
by
real
creatures
from
Runeterra
.
The
Baron
Nashor
you
see
on
the
map
is
actually
an
incomplete
facsimile
of
the
true
Baron
Nashor,
who
is
now
the
subject
of
myth
and
legend.
The
story
goes
that
Baron
Nashor
was
a
ferocious
worm
that
ruled
the
Serpentine
River
,
which
flows
through
Summoner’s
Rift.
He
was
such
a
fearsome
and
powerful
beast
that
even
the
armies
of
Demacia
and
Noxus
steered
clear
of
the
river,
unwilling
to
chance
an
encounter
with
the
Baron.
When
Summoner’s
Rift
was
constructed,
the
Baron
vanished,
leaving
no
conclusive
evidence
as
to
where
he
went
or
why
he
left
in
the
first
place.
Obviously
the
rumor-mill
has
churned
out
many
explanations,
but
all
we
know
for
sure
is
that
the
Senior
Arcane
Architect
for
the
Summoner’s
Rift
arena
was
said
to
have
crafted
the
version
you
see
today
from
no
more
than
a
molted
scale
and
interviews
with
those
who
had
seen
the
beast
and
lived.
