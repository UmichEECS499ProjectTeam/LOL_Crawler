Strategy
As
with
other
aura
items
such
as
Abyssal
Scepter
,
Frozen
Heart
's
debuff
can
give
away
potential
ganks.
Frozen
Heart
is
an
item
best
suited
for
tank
champions
because
of
the
high
amount
of
armor
and
cooldown
reduction
but
can
also
be
useful
for
tanky
support
champions.
Ryze
is
an
excellent
candidate
for
use
with
the
Frozen
Heart
,
since
the
damage
of
his
abilities
is
increased
with
his
maximum
mana.
The
added
mana
and
cooldown
reduction
also
gives
him
extra
sustainability
in
lane
and
the
armor
reduces
physical
damage
taken.
For
its
combine
cost
of
650
gold
,
Frozen
Heart
gives
150
mana,
30
armor,
10%
cooldown
reduction,
and
an
attack
speed
reducing
aura
.
The
Frozen
Heart
is
specificly
good
to
counter
DPS
Melee
Carries,
like
Master
Yi
,
Aatrox
,
Tryndamere
and
generaly
all
ADCs,
since
they
all
rely
on
autoattacks
and
the
decreased
attack
speed
will
heavily
reduce
their
damage
output.
Trivia
Frozen
Heart
,
Warden's
Mail
and
its
upgrade,
Randuin's
Omen
,
are
the
only
items
that
can
reduce
attack
speed
.
The
icon
used
for
Frozen
Heart
is
the
same
icon
from
the
popular
online
MMO
game,
World
of
Warcraft,
used
to
represent
a
'Citrine'
gem.
In
this
game,
the
gem
appears
orange.
The
item's
description
"Warning:
Do
not
thaw!"
is
a
reference
to
the
item
Eye
of
Skadi
from
the
mod
DotA:
Allstars,
whose
description
contains
the
exact
same
line.
The
Frozen
Brain
was
a
seasonal
item
for
the
2010
Harrowing
celebration.
It
has
the
same
stats
as
the
Frozen
Heart
,
just
a
different
name
and
picture.
