Strategy
Activation
is
composed
of
two
components:
increased
movement
speed,
and
the
ability
to
ignore
unit
collision.
The
latter
allows
you
to
run
through
minions,
champions
and
neutral
minions.
Notes
Ghost
will
still
be
in
effect
even
after
reviving
from
pseudo-death
(
Guardian
Angel
or
Chrono
Shift
).
Activating
Ghost
while
stealthed
will
not
break
the
stealth
effect.
The
cooldown
of
this
spell
can
be
reduced
by
Summoner's
Insight
and
boots
with
the
Distortion
enchantment.
When
both
are
combined,
Ghost
has
a
cooldown
of
141.75
seconds.
Trivia
Ryze
is
shown
using
this
spell
to
push
through
mobs
and
a
fallen
tower
in
the
League
of
Legends
Season
One
