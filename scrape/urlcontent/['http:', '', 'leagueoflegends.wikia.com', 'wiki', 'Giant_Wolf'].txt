A
Giant
Wolf
is
a
neutral
monster
in
League
of
Legends
.
It
is
described
in-game
as
"a
very
fast
monster
with
an
immense
chance
to
critical
strike
its
target".
It
can
be
found
with
two
Lesser
Wolves
on
Summoner's
Rift
and
on
Twisted
Treeline
.
Two
could
be
found
on
Twisted
Treeline
with
one
Rabid
Wolf
before
the
remake.
This
camp
alternated
with
two
Wraiths
with
one
Ghast
.
The
wolves
on
the
new
Twisted
Treeline
have
been
reworked
to
look
undead
in
order
to
match
the
theme
better.
In
Summoner's
Rift
it
will
also
have
a
buff
which
gives
back
a
percentage
of
missing
health
and
mana.
