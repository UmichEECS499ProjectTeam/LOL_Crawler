Trivia
This
item
resulted
from
the
separation
of
the
offensive
and
defensive
abilities
of
the
removed
item
Zhonya's
Ring
.
This
is
the
defensive
item;
Rabadon's
Deathcap
is
the
offensive
item.
Along
with
Rabadon's
Deathcap
and
Deathfire
Grasp
,
this
item
offers
the
highest
amount
of
ability
power
(not
taking
into
account
that
Rabadon's
Deathcap's
passive
works
with
itself)
On
their
own,
all
three
items
together
offer
468
AP.
The
"Hourglass"
in
the
name
is
a
reference
to
the
fact
that
by
using
its
active
ability,
you
are
granted
a
few
more
seconds
to
live.
Within
those
few
seconds,
your
cooldowns
will
continue
to
drop
and
your
team
may
come
to
help
you.
Champions
like
Twitch
can
benefit
from
these
few
seconds
to
"fade
to
stealth"
by
stealthing
then
activating
Zhonya's
Hourglass
.
After
emerging
from
the
stasis,
they
will
be
fully
stealthed
.
Zhonya's
Hourglass
can
help
with
taking
down
turrets
as
you
will
lose
aggro
when
you
become
untargetable,
meaning
you
don't
need
to
waste
time
walking
out
of
turret
range
for
it
to
transfer
targets,
and
makes
it
safer
to
stay
under
fire
for
a
longer
time.
Activating
the
active
will
cancel
channeled
abilities
;
however,
non-channeled
area
abilities
such
as
Fiddlesticks's
and
Morgana's
,
ultimates
will
continue,
making
Zhonya's
Hourglass
particularly
powerful
when
used
in
the
middle
of
an
enemy
team,
allowing
them
to
continue
doing
damage
while
being
invulnerable
to
counterattack.
While
Stasis
is
active,
any
pets
the
user
currently
has
(e.g.
Mordekaiser's
Children
of
the
Grave
or
Annie's
Summon
Tibbers
)
can
still
be
issued
commands.
