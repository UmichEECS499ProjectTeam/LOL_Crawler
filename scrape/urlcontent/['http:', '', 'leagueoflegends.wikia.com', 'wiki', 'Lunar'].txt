2012
The
Lunar
Revel
is
an
event
based
on
the
Lunar
New
Year
in
the
Asian
Lunar
calendar.
It
has
been
celebrated
in
the
League
of
Legends
world
since
2012
and
continued
in
2013
[1]
.
It
started
on
January
10,
2012,
and
was
accompanied
by
the
release
of
four
new
skins
and
the
temporary
renaming
and
replacement
of
pictures
of
several
consumable
items.

Background
Lunar
New
Year
is
an
annual
festival
still
popularly
celebrated
by
the
Asian
cultures
such
as
Chinese,
Korean
and
Vietnamese.
Every
lunar
new
year
changes
the
symbolic
animal
of
the
Chinese
zodiac
.
The
Lunar
Revel
skins
also
reflect
that
animal
of
the
year
accordingly.
For
example,
Dragon
is
the
zodiac
animal
of
2012,
so
three
of
four
skins
feature
the
dragon
theme
in
the
name
and
the
design.
In
2013,
it
is
the
year
of
snake,
so
Cassiopeia
was
given
her
Lunar
Revel
skin
that
year.
