Redirected
from
Top
Lanes
are
the
main
paths
that
minions
follow
in
the
course
of
a
game.
Lanes
are
defended
by
turrets
,
and
in
order
to
push
the
enemy
into
their
base
and
destroy
their
inhibitors
and
Nexus
,
each
successive
turret
in
a
lane
must
be
destroyed
before
damage
can
be
dealt
to
the
next
structure.
Along
each
lane
are
located
areas
of
brush
for
tactical
maneuvering,
such
as
juking
and
ganking.
Controlling
a
lane
is
a
key
tactical
component
of
gameplay;
early
lane
control
in
a
game
can
put
your
opponents
at
a
disadvantage
by
keeping
them
away
from
your
turrets
and
denying
last
hits
on
minions
for
much-needed
gold.

Summoner's
Rift
Main
article:
Summoner's
Rift
Lanes
in
Summoner's
Rift
Summoner's
Rift
has
3
lanes
(Top,
Bottom
and
Middle)
which
are
defended
by
3
turrets
(Outer,
Inner,
Inhibitor).
Each
adjacent
lane
is
connected
from
different
points
through
the
Jungle
or
by
the
river
that
runs
diagonally
through
the
map.
What
lane
do
I
pick?
Right
now,
the
general
rule
is
that
one
champion
goes
top,
one
goes
to
the
jungle,
two
go
bottom,
and
one
goes
in
the
middle.
If
you
are
having
trouble
with
the
champion(s)
you
are
facing,
you
should
ask
someone
to
switch
with
you.
Around
level
30
it
starts
to
get
more
complicated.
There
are
many
combinations,
the
most
popular
format
of
metagame
at
the
moment
tends
to
follow
a
set
pattern
of
one
jungler
,
a
tanky
-DPS
at
top,
an
ability
power
reliant
caster
will
go
middle
and
the
carry
going
bottom
along
with
a
support
champion.
This
doesnt
mean
you
won't
play
against
different
compositions
however.
The
Twisted
Treeline
Main
article:
Twisted
Treeline
Lanes
in
Twisted
Treeline
(old)
The
Twisted
Treeline
has
two
lanes,
top
and
bottom,
that
are
defended
by
2
Turrets
(Outer,
Inhibitor).
Typically,
the
top
lane
is
the
solo
lane,
with
the
other
two
team
members
trying
to
gain
a
foothold
in
the
bottom
lane.
The
narrower
distance
between
lanes
demands
more
care
against
sudden
ganks
.
Top
Lane
takes
a
longer
time
to
get
from
the
first
turret
to
the
second
turret
while
the
bottom
lane
is
shorter
from
the
first
turret
to
the
second
turret.
Lane
Widths
Lanes
on
Summoner's
Rift
are
approximately
1000
units
wide.
Lanes
on
Twisted
Treeline
are
approximately
800-850
units
wide
(varies).
The
ring
on
the
Crystal
Scar
is
approximately
800
units
wide.
The
lane
on
Howling
Abyss
is
approximately
1700
units
wide.
