"Claw
or
spear,
your
end's
the
same."
It
has
been
suggested
that
this
article
or
section
be
merged
into
Champion
ability
.
Please
discuss
this
here
.
The
Ultimate
is
the
fourth
ability
of
most
Champions
.
The
ultimate
is
considered
a
champion's
defining
ability
and
is
oftentimes
considered
their
strongest.
It
is
controlled
by
the
'R'
key
on
the
keyboard.
Ultimates
vary
greatly
between
champions,
with
some
having
passive
effects
(
Jax's
Grandmaster's
Might
),
some
having
global
effects
(
Karthus's
Requiem
),
some
being
spammable
from
having
low
cooldowns
(
Kassadin's
Riftwalk
),
some
being
auras
(
Sivir's
On
The
Hunt
)
and
some
summoning
other
units
(
Annie's
Summon:
Tibbers
).
Whether
an
ultimate
is
considered
a
champion's
strongest
ability
or
not,
using
your
ultimate
effectively
is
crucial
to
playing
any
champion.
Ultimates
are
defined
by
being
able
to
be
taken
at
levels
6,
11,
and
16.
It
is
also
possible
to
tell
whether
or
not
an
allied
Champion's
ultimate
is
ready
or
not,
by
the
indicator.
The
indicator
is
the
green
dot
which
is
placed
right
beside
the
respective
champion's
portrait
on
the
left
side
of
your
screen.
When
the
green
light
is
on,
the
champion's
ultimate
is
ready.
If
the
light
is
off,
the
champion
has
either
not
learned
the
ability
or
it
is
currently
on
cooldown.
There
is
currently
only
one
champion
that
doesn't
have
an
Ultimate:
Udyr
.
He
has
four
Stances
that
are
all
trainable
up
to
level
5.
Elise's
Spider
Form
/
Human
Form
,
Jayce's
Mercury
Hammer
/
Mercury
Cannon
,
and
Karma's
Mantra
are
all
available
at
level
1
for
the
respective
champion,
but
can
still
be
leveled
up
at
level
6,
11
and
16,
making
them
special
in
having
4
ranks.
Global
Ultimates
Some
champion
ultimates
have
an
unlimited,
global
range,
allowing
them
to
either
support
from
afar
or
kill
an
otherwise
safe
enemy
(i.e.
a
low
health
enemy
who
is
staying
in
tower
range
for
safety).
Generally,
the
point
of
a
global
ultimate
is
to
be
a
threat
to
enemy
champions
from
anywhere
on
the
map.
The
global
ultimates
are
Gangplank's
Cannon
Barrage
,
Karthus's
Requiem
,
Ezreal's
Trueshot
Barrage
,
Draven's
Whirling
Death
,
Ashe's
Enchanted
Crystal
Arrow
,
Soraka's
Wish
,
Shen's
Stand
United
and
Jinx's
Super
Mega
Death
Rocket!
.
Nocturne's
Paranoia
and
Twisted
Fate's
Destiny
are
partially
global,
with
the
first
part
of
the
ultimate
having
global
range,
but
the
second
part
having
limited
range.
