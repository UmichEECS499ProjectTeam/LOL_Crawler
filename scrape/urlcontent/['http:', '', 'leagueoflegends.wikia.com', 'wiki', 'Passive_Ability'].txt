All
champions
possess
a
unique
passive
or
innate
ability
which
is
active
from
the
start
of
a
game.
Some
passive
abilities
improve
as
a
champion
levels,
for
example,
Ashe
.
Some
passive
abilities
encourage
players
to
build
a
champion
in
a
particular
way,
such
as
Galio
.
Others
enhance
potential
deficiencies
such
as
Dr.
Mundo's
increased
health
regeneration
which
helps
replenish
health
spent
on
abilities.
Categories
Passive
abilities
can
be
divided
into
eight
categories
as
follows.
Aura
A
bonus
or
penalty
(buff/debuff,
respectively)
that
affects
nearby
units:
allied,
enemy
or
both.
Some
of
them
are
active
no
matter
the
distance.
Offensive
Grants
an
additional
effect/buff
to
the
basic
attack
of
the
champion
and/or
it's
related
factors
(attack
speed,
critical
chance,
etc).
Ability
Grants
a
bonus
related
to
the
champion
abilites
and/or
it's
related
factors
(ability
power,
mana,
etc).
Defensive
Damage
reduction
toward
the
champion.
Utility
Not
directly
related
to
damage
reduction
or
capacity
to
deal
damage
of
the
champion
(though
certain
innates
have
secondary
effects
which
can
be
related
to
those).
Death
Grants
a
bonus
at
the
death
of
enemies,
allies
or
even
the
champion
possessing
the
ability.
Stacking
Grants
a
bonus
after
a
specified
amount
of

uses
and/or
basic
attacks.
The
count
is
seen
in-game
as
a
stack.

another
stat
(for
example:
bonus
mana
for

Ability
Power).
