Skill
usage
Use
Cryptic
Gaze
to
get
closer
to
the
enemy
and
hit
them
with
your
Death's
Caress
.
Laning
together
with
a
burst
champion
is
a
potent
combination
as
Cryptic
Gaze
has
a
1.5
second
stun
at
level
1,
one
of
the
longest
non-ultimate
stuns
in
the
game.
Combining
Cryptic
Gaze
with
Exhaust
lets
you
stun,
then
slow
a
target,
heavily
disabling
them
for
about
4
seconds.
If
they
are
still
nearby,
the
cooldown
from
Cryptic
Gaze
will
have
refreshed,
allowing
for
decent
harassment.
Death's
Caress
deals
full
damage,
regardless
of
how
much
shield
strength
is
remaining.
Use
this
to
your
advantage
by
activating
it
after
absorbing
some
damage.
Using
Enrage
with
life
steal
means
that
the
cost
of
the
spell
is
less
than
the
life
you
steal
back.
This
means
that
Enrage
can
be
kept
active
indefinitely.
Sion
has
high
burst
potential
when
building
ability
power
as
he
can
combo
his
Death's
Caress
with
Cryptic
Gaze
.
Activate
Death's
Caress
before
using
Enrage
.
Use
Cryptic
Gaze
,
run
in
and
attack,
then
pop
your
shield.
This
is
an
effective
harassment
strategy.
Kills
made
by
Death's
Caress
will
contribute
to
the
extra
maximum
health
from
Enrage
.
This
means
that
even
an
AP
Sion
can
utilize
Enrage
.
When
Sion
lanes
in
a
solo
lane
it
is
possible
to
get
first
blood
at
level
2
by
using
the
stun
from
his
Cryptic
Gaze
and
his
Enrage
to
devastate
the
other
solo
laner.
When
playing
as
AD
Sion
,
try
to
take
advantage
of
the
large
bonus
to
AD
that
Enrage
gives
you,
as
you
can
easily
reach
over
110
AD
early
with
little
to
no
investment
in
AD
items
or
runes.
Both
Cryptic
Gaze
and
Cannibalism
can
be
used
in
a
defensive
manner
to
save
allies
and
sustain
pushes.
Also,
these
can
be
used
offensively.
Use
Cryptic
Gaze
to
get
in
close,
and
pop
Cannibalism
for
the
increased
attack
speed
and
life
steal.
Use
these
along
Death's
Caress
for
quick
turret
dives.
Using
Cannibalism
with
a
DPS
build
is
a
good
way
to
quickly
take
down
turrets
as
his
high
attack
damage
combined
with
the
attack
speed
boost
makes
Sion
a
great
pusher.
When
playing
AD
Sion
,
use
Cannibalism
and
attack
the
nearest
low
armor
enemy,
maximizing
your
life
steal
and
allied
heal.
Build
usage
Sion
has
two
common
builds:
melee
DPS
and
AP
mage.
In
both
builds,
Feel
No
Pain
and
Enrage
allow
Sion
maintain
a
decent
level
of
survivability
even
when
building
damage
items.
His
DPS
builds
aim
to
capitalize
on
Cannibalism
and
its
massive
bonuses;
a
Sion
kept
alive
will
in
turn
keep
his
team
healed
through
the
allied
heal.
Cryptic
Gaze
's
reliable
disable
remains
powerful,
while
Death's
Caress
is
still
a
strong
shield
and
farming
tool.
Since
DPS
builds
tend
to
maximize
Enrage
first,
DPS
Sion
can
also
be
more
tanky
by
endgame,
due
to
the
extra
health
from
a
higher
leveled
Enrage
.
Due
to
the
health
gain
from
his
Enrage
,
buying
an
Atma's
Impaler
will
increase
his
damage
output
while
giving
him
armor.
This
also
means
he
is
the
only
champion
whose
AD
has
no
limit,
as
he
gains
1
AD
for
every
22
kills
when
enrage
is
maxed.
Life
steal
items,
such
as
Vampiric
Scepter
early
and
its
build
paths
late,
allow
Sion
to
negate
the
health
cost
of
using
Enrage
,
and
can
be
built
into
strong
late
game
items,
such
as
Ravenous
Hydra
and
The
Bloodthirster
.
Building
into
2
Vampiric
Scepter
's
early
can
give
Sion
20%
of
the
24%
lifesteal
to
keep
Enrage
active
continuously.
Vampirism
Masteries
can
give
you
another
3%,
essentially
bringing
you
to
1-3
HP
per
attack.
When
combined
with
Cannibalism
,
high
life
steal
items
such
as
The
Bloodthirster
can
make
it
almost
impossible
for
enemies
to
outdamage
Sion's
life
steal.
His
AP
builds
focus
on
the
very
strong
damage
potential
of
both
Cryptic
Gaze
and
Death's
Caress
,
both
of
which
have
a
0.9
AP
ratio.
Sion's
survivability
is
also
improved
through
item
choice,
and
ease
of
farming
health
with
Enrage
.
Sion's
Enrage
damage
boost
and
Cannibalism
combined
make
his
physical
damage
output
respectable
as
well.
AP
builds
usually
include
a
Doran's
Ring
or
two,
a
Rod
of
Ages
or
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
and
an
early
Rabadon's
Deathcap
for
maximum
damage.
Lich
Bane
is
often
a
core
item
for
AP
Sion
for
the
added
damage,
however
his
cooldowns
are
not
nearly
short
enough
to
take
full
advantage
of
the
passive.
Grabbing
it
does,
however,
grant
quick
burst
if
you
are
close
enough.
While
AP
Sion
is
potent
early
-
mid
game
and
later,
an
AD
Sion
shines
mid
-
late
game.
His
Enrage
grants
him
the
possibility
to
gain
"infinite"
health,
and
grabbing
an
Atma's
Impaler
will
allow
his
AD
to
do
the
same.
However,
do
not
underestimate
the
potential
of
AP
Sion
.
He
can
farm
very
well
since
Death's
Caress
on
AP
Sion
allows
exceptional
farming
for
Enrage
,
allowing
him
to,
in
most
cases,
gain
more
farm
quicker
and
help
stack
up
his
health
faster.

Countering
Try
to
CC
Sion
or
reduce
his
healing
with
Ignite
or
another
healing
reduction
during
Cannibalism
.
Although
Enrage
increases
his
damage,
it
drains
his
health
with
each
attack
he
made.
Use
this
to
your
advantage.
If
facing
an
AD
Sion
,
it
is
extremely
important
that
you
do
not
let
him
farm.
An
AD
Sion
can
heal
his
team
for
hundreds
of
HP
with
a
few
autoattacks,
his
late
game
is
possibly
the
most
powerful
out
of
all
champions
in
the
league
but
at
the
price
of
a
horrible
early
game.
Do
NOT
engage
him
as
a
melee
champion
alone
as
he
is
a
master
of
1v1,
instead
kite
him
during
his
ultimate
or
disable
him,
wasting
it
and
maybe
allowing
your
team
to
turn
the
game
around.
Sion
also
grows
his
health
rapidly
past
level
6
if
allowed
to
continuously
farm.
Starve
him
of
waves
and
jungle
creep
if
he
attempts
to
rush
his
Enrage
stacks.
Countering
Sion
depends
on
his
build.
If
he
is
building
AP,
investing
a
magic
resistance
item
can
help
mitigate
his
damage,
especially
Banshee's
Veil
as
his
damage
is
focused
into
only
two
spells.
If
he
is
building
AD,
a
Thornmail
or
Executioner's
Calling
will
help
to
counter
him.
Try
to
destroy
the
shield
from
his
Death's
Caress
rather
than
waiting
until
the
shield
duration
is
over
to
prevent
it
from
exploding.
However,
not
destroying
the
shield
completely
is
a
waste
of
damage,
as
it
will
still
do
full
damage.
