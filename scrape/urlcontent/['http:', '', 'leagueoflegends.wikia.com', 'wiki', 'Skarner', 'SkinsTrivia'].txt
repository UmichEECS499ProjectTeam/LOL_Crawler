Trivia
Skarner
was
designed
by
Volty
.
Skarner's
name
is
likely
derived
from
an
old
Swedish
mining
term
"skarn",
which
referred
either
to
silicate
waste
rock
or
iron-bearing
sulfite
deposits.
Skarner
is
voiced
by
David
Lodge
,
Who
also
voices
Galio
.
Skarner
was
first
seen
in
Brand's
Art
Spotlight.
The
Art
Spotlight
was
removed
when
the
leak
was
noticed,
and
replaced
with
an
edited
version.
Some
champions,
prior
to
their
release,
have
an
article
in
the
Journal
of
Justice
which
foreshadows
their
arrival.
As
Skarner's
arrival
ties
directly
into
the
fate
of
Kalamanda
,
his
entry
as
a
champion
has
been
the
longest
known
buildup
in
LoL's
official
lore.
Skarner
ties
for
highest
base
damage
at
level
18
with
Cho'Gath
(130).
Skarner's
site
of
emergence,
the
Crystal
Scar
,
is
the
Field
of
Justice
for
Dominion
.
IronStylus
has
stated
that
Skarner's
head
is
based
on
an
EVA
unit
from
Neon
Genesis
Evangelion
.
Quotes
His
joke:
"Oh
no!
I
seem
to
have
stepped
on
one
of
my
cousins!"
is
most
likely
a
reference
to
the
first
Men
in
Black
movie.
Skarner
shares
a
line
with
Kha'Zix
:
"Limb
from
limb!"
Skarner's
quote
while
standing
in
the
brush
for
a
time
(Skar-Skar-Skarner!)
is
a
reference
to
the
Pokémon
franchise,
specificially
those
who
say
their
own
name
as
their
racial
cry.
Skins
Earthrune
Skarner
bears
a
resemblance
to
the
elementals
of
the
Selesnya
Conclave
of
Ravnica
in
that
they
are
made
of
bits
of
masonry
connected
by
a
system
of
plants.
Examples
of
Selesnya
elementals
can
be
found
here
and
here.
There
may
be
an
upcoming
Battlecast
Skarner
skin
because
such
a
character
appears
in
the
bottom
left
corner
of
Battlecast
Prime
Cho'gath
'
s
splash
art.
A
view
of
Battlecast
Skarner
'
s
face
and
stinger
can
be
found
in
the
splash
art
for
Creator
Viktor
.
