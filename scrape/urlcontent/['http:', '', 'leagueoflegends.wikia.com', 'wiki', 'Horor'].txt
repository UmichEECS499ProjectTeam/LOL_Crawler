Horor
Crest
of
Honor
Honor
is
a
point
system
introduced
to
League
of
Legends
on
October
1
st
,
2012.
The
Honor
system
was
created
to
incentivize
positive
behavior
among
the
League
of
Legends
community
and
identify
summoners
that
would
be
considered
pillars
of
the
community.
Currently,
Honor
does
not
provide
any
rewards
or
perks
other
than
the
points
themselves,
though
this
could
change
in
the
future.
[1]
Players
can
only
honor
other
players
in
matchmade
games
(including
Co-op
vs
AI),
as
this
feature
is
unavailable
for
Custom
games.

Honor
Categories
Friendly:
Summoners
who
would
be
honored
through
this
category
are
those
that
have
a
positive
impact
on
your
game
and
make
the
match
enjoyable,
win
or
lose.
Helpful:
This
category
is
for
summoners
that
share
their
know-how
and
actively
help
other
players
improve
their
gameplay.
Honorable
Opponent:
Honorable
Opponents
are
players
from
the
opposing
team
that
remain
humble
in
victory
or
graceful
in
defeat
and/or
behave
in
a
positive
manner
throughout
the
game.
This
is
the
only
category
where
a
player
can
receive
a
crest
without
any
points
in
the
other
categories.
[2]
The
crest
awarded
is
red.
Teamwork:
This
category
honors
players
that
put
the
team
ahead
of
themselves.
This
includes
anything
from
forming
great
plans,
helping
struggling
lanes
recuperate,
and
more.

Honoring
a
Player
Click
on
the
"Thumbs
Up"
button
to
honor
a
player
Honor
allows
you
to
acknowledge
other
summoners
that
have
had
a
positive
role
in
any
of
your
matchmade
games.
Similarly
to
reporting
a
player
for
negative
behavior,
you
can
honor
others
at
the
result
screen
at
the
end
of
a
match.
By
clicking
on
the
green
"Thumbs
Up"
button
next
to
a
summoner's
name,
you
will
be
given
a
choice
out
of
three
of
the
honor
categories
for
allied
players,
or
you
may
select
"Honorable
Opponent"
when
honoring
enemy
players.
Selecting
one
of
the
options
will
grant
that
player
honor
in
the
selected
category.
Honoring
a
player
makes
it
impossible
to
report
the
same
player
for
negative
behavior.
Inversely,
reporting
a
player
makes
it
impossible
to
honor
that
same
player.
[3]
Do
note
that
every
summoner
has
a
limited
amount
of
honor
to
give,
which
is
dependent
on
the
number
of
matchmade
games
you
play.
This
is
a
safety
measure
put
in
place
to
prevent
players
from
trading
honor
or
"farming"
it.
Players
using
the
system
responsibly
and
as
intended
will
never
run
out
of
honor
to
hand
out.
Honoring
players
at
every
opportunity
or
trading
honor
will
easily
make
you
reach
this
limit.

Receiving
honor
Honoring
friends
is
completely
acceptable
and
it
is
encouraged
if
the
summoner
in
question
is
truly
being
an
honorable
player.
On
the
other
hand,
constantly
granting
honor
to
the
same
person
after
each
match
will
be
detected
by
the
system
and
may
involve
consequences.
In
terms
of
unlocking
crests,
players
will
effectively
be
granted
a
different
amount
of
honor
depending
on
who
honored
them.
For
instance,
a
player
that
was
honored
by
a
stranger
in
a
matchmade
game
will
count
more
towards
a
crest
than
a
player
that
was
honored
by
a
friend
that
they
queued
with,
even
though
the
counter
goes
up
by
one
in
both
cases.
Reviewing
Honor
You
can
see
your
Honor,
separated
into
the
four
categories,
on
your
summoner
profile.
Honor
is
displayed
directly
above
your
Stats
Overview
and
shows
each
category's
individual
values.
This
bar
is
visible
to
all
players
that
view
your
profile,
and
you
can
see
others'
honor
as
well
by
visiting
their
summoner
profile.
Honor,
as
seen
on
the
summoner
profile
Crests
and
Ribbons
When
a
player
has
consistently
received
honor
in
the
appropriate
categories,
they
will
be
presented
with
an
animation
on
their
summoner
profile
and
be
awarded
a
crest.
For
Honorable
Opponent,
this
is
achieved
by
consistently
being
honored
in
the
honorable
opponent
category.
For
the
remaining
three
crests,
a
combination
of
the
honor
categories
must
be
achieved.
The
animations
for
the
four
crests
can
be
seen
here
.
Although
the
official
term
is
crest,
[4]
many
players
refer
to
crests
as
ribbons
due
to
their
appearance.
Only
a
single
crest
will
be
displayed
at
a
time,
even
if
a
player
has
unlocked
more
than
one
crest.
The
crest
displayed
will
be
the
rarest
out
of
those
that
the
player
has
unlocked.
[5]
[6]
Crests
are
visible
to
other
players
during
champion
select
and
on
the
loading
screen,
where
it
will
be
placed
on
the
top
left
corner
of
your
box.
There
are
four
crests:
Great
Leader,
Great
Mentor,
Great
Teammate
and
Honorable
Opponent.
[7]
Honorable
Opponent
is
the
only
one
that
appears
visible
for
the
enemy
team.
All
crests
are
visible
to
spectators.
As
of
the
late
October
patch
(Shadow
Isle),
Honorable
Opponent
has
been
made
viewable
to
both
the
enemy
team
and
the
player's
own
team
during
both
champion
select
and
on
the
loading
screen.
Crests
are
temporary
rewards
designed
to
encourage
players
to
remain
honorable
even
after
receiving
the
recognition.
As
such,
they
can
be
lost
if
players
stop
acting
positively
and
no
longer
receive
honor.
Being
punished
by
the
tribunal
will
also
remove
all
crests
from
a
player,
similarly
to
honor
points.
For
a
player
to
receive
a
crest,
they
must
be
consistently
honored
in
the
appropriate
category
or
categories
and
there
is
not
an
exact
number
of
honor
in
each
category
to
receive
a
crest.

Lyte
,
a
member
of
the
Riot
staff,
had
this
to
say
about
the
way
crests
are
awarded:
[10]
"Crests
aren't
based
on
Honor
counts
in
your
profile.
Honor
assesses
the
value
of
all
your
exchanges
to
determine
how
Honorable
you
are
compared
to
the
rest
of
the
population."
Lyte
also
stated
that
the
crests
besides
the
Honorable
Opponent
are
not
as
straightforward,
saying:
[11]
"Here's
a
secret,
the
base
Honors
(Friendly,
Teamwork,
Helpful,
Honorable
Opponent)
are
not
1:1
with
the
Crests
of
Honor.
There's
the
Crest
of
Honor
-
Honorable
Opponent
that
many
have
unlocked
and
yes,
you
just
need
Honorable
Opponent
Honors
to
unlock
that.
However,
the
other
Crests
are
not
so
simple...
In
fact,
has
anyone
figured
out
what
the
other
Crests
are
even
called?
;)
That
might
give
you
a
clue
about
how
to
earn
them."
Great
Mentor
Crest
-
the
crest
is
greenish
blue
-
this
is
a
combination
of
Helpful
and
Friendly
[12]
Supportive
and
helpful,
a
Summoner
that
teaches
players
about
the
league.
Great
Teammate
Crest
-
the
crest
is
green
Cooperative
and
works
with
teams
to
secure
victory.
Great
Leader
Crest
-
the
crest
is
yellow
Leads
teams
to
victory
through
great
communication.
