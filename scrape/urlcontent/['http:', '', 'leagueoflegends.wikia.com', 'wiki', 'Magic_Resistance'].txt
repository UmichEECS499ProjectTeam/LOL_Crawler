Magic
resistance
(or
MR
)
is
a
stat
that
all
units
have,
including
minions
,
monsters
,
and
buildings.
Increasing
magic
resistance
reduces
the
magic
damage
the
unit
takes.
Each
champion
begins
with
some
magic
resistance
which
may
increase
with
level.
You
can
gain
additional
magic
resistance
from
abilities
,
items
,
masteries
,
and
runes
.
Magic
resistance
stacks
additively
.
All
champions
begin
with
30
base
magic
resistance.
Currently
no
ranged
champion
gains
magic
resistance
per
level,
but
most
melee
champions
do
except
Galio
,
Kassadin
,
Maokai
,
Poppy
,
Shen
,
Singed
,
and
Yasuo
.
Elise
,
Jayce
,
Kayle
and
Nidalee
do
not
gain
magic
resistance
per
level
because
they
are
not
always
melee
champions
due
to
their
variable
attack
range.
All
champions
that
do
gain
magic
resistance
per
level
gain
1.
25
magic
resistance
per
level,
reaching
52.
5
base
magic
resistance
at
level
18.

Damage
reduction
Magic
Resistance
reduces
the
damage
of
incoming
magical
attacks
by
a
percentage.
This
percentage
is
determined
by
the
formula:
Damage
Reduction
=
Total
Magic
Resistance
/
(100
+
Total
Magic
Resistance).
For
example,
a
champion
with
150
points
of
magic
resistance
would
receive
60%
reduced
damage
from
magical
attacks.
Incoming
magic
damage
is
multiplied
by
a
factor
based
on
the
unit's
magic
resistance(same
with
armor):
$${\rm
Damage\
multiplier}=\begin{cases}
{100
\over
100+{\it
MR}},
&
{\rm
if\
}{\it
MR}
\geq
0\\
2
-
{100
\over
100
-
{\it
MR}},
&
{\rm
otherwise}
\end{cases}$$
Examples:
25
magic
resistance
→
×
0.
8
incoming
magic
damage
(20%
reduction).
100
magic
resistance
→
×
0.
5
incoming
magic
damage
(50%
reduction).
−25
magic
resistance
→
×
1.
2
incoming
magic
damage
(20%
increase).
Stacking
magic
resistance
Every
point
of
magic
resistance
requires
a
unit
to
take
1%
more
of
its
maximum
health
in
magic
damage
to
be
killed.
This
is
called
"effective
health."
Example:
A
unit
with
60
magic
resistance
has
160%
of
its
maximum
health
in
its
effective
health,
so
if
the
unit
has
1000
maximum
health,
it
will
take
1600
magic
damage
to
kill
it.
What
this
means:
by
definition,
magic
resistance
does
not
have
diminishing
returns,
because
each
point
increases
the
unit's
effective
health
against
magic
damage
by
1%
of
its
current
actual
health
value
whether
the
unit
has
10
magic
resistance
or
1000
magic
resistance.
For
a
more
detailed
explanation,
see
this
video
.
Unlike
health,
increasing
magic
resistance
makes
healings
and
shields
more
effective
because
it
requires
more
effort
from
your
enemies
to
remove
the
bonus
health
granted.
This
is
called
indirect
scaling.
Magic
Resistance
as
Scaling
These
use
the
champion's
magic
resistance
to
increase
the
magnitude
of
the
ability.
It
could
involve
total
or
bonus
magic
resistance.
By
building
magic
resistance
items,
you
can
receive
more
benefit
and
power
from
these
abilities.
Champions

bonus
magic
resistance
