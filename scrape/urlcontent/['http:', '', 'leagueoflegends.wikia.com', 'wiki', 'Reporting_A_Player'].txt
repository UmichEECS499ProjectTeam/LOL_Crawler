Reporting
A
Player
The
reporting
function
in
League
of
Legends
allows
players
to
mark
another
user
as
being
a
negative/bad
Clicking
the
exclamation
in
the
post
game
chat,
or
right-clicking
the
offensive
player
will
give
you
the
option
to
report
them.
Reports
are
used
in
the
Tribunal
where
the
offensive
players
are
judged
by
their
fellow
players.
After
you
clicked
the
exclamation
mark
next
to
the
offensive
player's
name,
you
will
then
be
able
to
report
the
player
for
various
behaviors.

Reporting
Options
Harassment:
Offensive
Language
Including,
but
not
limited
to
language
that
is
vulgar,
obscene,
sexually
explicit,
or
racially,
ethnically,
or
otherwise
objectionable.
Harassment:
Verbal
Abuse
Including,
but
not
limited
to
language
that
is
unlawful,
harmful,
threatening,
abusive,
harassing,
defamatory,
or
otherwise
objectionable.
Griefing:
Assisting
Enemy
Team
This
includes
using
all-chat
or
summoner
abilities
to
assist
the
opposing
team
in
any
way.
Unskilled
Player
If
you
feel
that
a
player
is
not
playing
as
well
as
they
should
be
-
such
as
having
an
inability
to
farm,
not
using
skills
properly,
having
a
build
that
is
counterproductive,
and
having
poor
map
awareness,
you
can
report
that
player
for
being
unskilled.
When
players
are
reported
for
"Unskilled
Player",
no
tribunal
case
is
made
and
the
report
doesn't
count
against
them
if
a
case
is
made
for
another
reason,
however
if
they
are
reported
for
being
unskilled
consecutively,
their
Match-Making-Rating
will
slightly
drop.
This
does
not
affect
ranked
matchmaking
or
players
ranked
Elo/MMR.
This
option
is
mainly
used
as
a
placebo
for
players
that
are
acting
negatively
towards
their
teammates.
Refuse
to
Communicate
With
Team
Applies
to
any
player
that
refuses
to
use
chat
or
pings.
Leaving
the
Game/AFK
This
includes
logging
out
or
exiting
the
game
before
a
match
ends
or
stand
idle
for
long
periods
of
time
or
refuse
to
participate
in
the
match
at
all.
Negative
Attitude
Any
player
that
is
constantly
putting
other
players
down
or
being
generally
negative
about
the
game
Inappropriate
Name
When
you
see
a
summoner
name
that
is
falsely
indicative
of
an
association
with
Riot
Games,
containing
personally
identifying
information,
infringes
on
the
proprietary
rights
of
third
party,
or
that
is
offensive,
defamatory,
vulgar,
obscene,
sexually
explicit,
racially,
ethnically,
or
otherwise
objectionable.
This
also
applies
if
the
name
uses
a
misspelling
or
an
alternate
spelling
to
circumvent
this
restriction
on
summoner
name
choices.
Spamming
Whether
for
personal
or
commercial
purposes,
by
disrupting
the
flow
of
conversation
with
repeated
posting
of
a
similar
nature.
This
is
also
the
accepted
spot
for
reporting
players
who
abuse
the
honor
system
by
"trading"
honor.
