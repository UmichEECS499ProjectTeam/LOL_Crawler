Draft
Pick
is
type
of
Game
Mode
included
in
League
of
Legends
.
History
The
Draft
Pick
was
included
in
the
Season
One
Patch.
[1]
It
took
part
in
the
competition
system
for
the
Season
One
Ranked
Games
.
Since
September
20,
2011
Draft
Mode
has
been
made
available
for
unranked
games
on
the
Summoner's
Rift
and
the
Crystal
Scar
.
Process
In
5v5
premade
and
3v3
premade,
the
first
phase
of
this
draft
process
will
provide
the
inviter
of
each
team
with
the
opportunity
to
ban
the
use
of
three
champions.
In
unranked/normal
draft,
a
random
player
will
be
selected
as
team
captain.
However,
if
there
are
some
premade
players,
the
one
who
invited
the
others
will
absorb
their
probabilities
of
being
captain
(for
example,
if
it
is
3
premades,
the
host
would
have
60%
chances
of
being
captain,
his
two
partners
would
have
0%,
and
the
two
solo
players
would
have
20%
each).
In
ranked/draft,
the
player
with
the
highest
Elo
will
be
selected
as
captain,
and
the
order
of
the
rest
of
the
team
is
constructed
from
highest
to
lowest.
Banned
champions
cannot
be
selected
for
use
on
either
team,
so
choose
wisely!
In
organized
play
where
teams
are
familiar
with
each
other,
champions
that
someone
on
the
other
team
play
exceptionally
well
are
normally
banned
to
try
to
gain
an
advantage.
In
solo
queue,
bans
are
normally
reserved
for
champions
that
are
widely
considered
to
be
overpowered
and
are
likely
to
be
picked.
Bans
are
done
in
an
alternating
format,
each
team
banning
a
single
champion
until
6
champions
have
been
banned.
After
bans
have
been
dispensed
by
both
sides,
the
teams
will
begin
the
draft
process.
During
play,
draft
picks
will
be
exclusive,
meaning
that
a
drafted
champion
will
not
be
available
for
play
by
the
opposing
team.
The
team
who
received
the
first
ban
will
begin
the
drafting
process
in
a
1:2:2:2:2:1
draft
format
for
the
5v5
brackets
and
a
1:2:2:1
format
for
the
3v3
bracket.
6
bans
(3
per
side)
are
allowed
in
Draft
Mode.
This
means
a
player
must
have
access
to
at
least
16
champions
in
order
to
participate.
Those
16
champions
can
be
either
owned
by
the
player
or
belonging
to
the
free
rotation
in
case
of
normal
draft,
whereas
in
solo
or
duo
ranked
all
16
champions
must
be
owned,
since
free
champions
are
no
longer
allowed
to
be
picked
in
ranked(but
you
can
still
pick
free
champions
you
own).
Selecting
a
champion
that
another
player
on
your
team
owns
will
give
you
the
ability
to
trade
champions
with
the
other
player,
provided
he
also
owns
the
champion
you
selected.
A
clickable
icon
will
appear
to
the
right
of
your
champion's
portrait
after
all
players
have
locked
in
their
champions.
When
this
icon
is
clicked,
a
confirmation
box
appears
on
your
screen,
and
you
can
select
accept
or
decline.
This
is
useful
for
securing
a
powerful
champion
for
your
team
early
in
the
pick
process,
or
if
you
are
unsure
you
want
to
play
the
role
you
selected
a
champion
for
(e.g,
a
jungler
might
change
his
mind
and
want
to
be
a
top
laner
instead
or
vice
versa.)
