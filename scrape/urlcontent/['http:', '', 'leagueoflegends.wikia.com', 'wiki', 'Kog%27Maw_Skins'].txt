Trivia
Kog'Maw
was
designed
by
Ezreal.
Kog'Maw
is
voiced
by
Patrick
Seitz
,
who
also
voices
Renekton
,
Rengar
and
Lucian
.
Kog'Maw
was
first
spotted
during
the
official
Malzahar
announcement
post.
He
can
be
seen
in
one
of
the
screenshots.
Kog'Maw's
name
may
be
reference
to
the
Cebuano
term
"kogmo"
which
refers
to
hardened
mucus
in
the
nose.
The
'Maw'
part
also
means
an
appetite;
a
stomach;
the
receptacle
into
which
food
is
taken
by
swallowing.
Ironically,
even
though
Kog'Maw's
lore
and
a
majority
of
his
quotes
speak
of
his
"insatiable"
hunger,
every
ability
(except
his
passive)
involves
regurgitation.
His
/dance
is
a
tribute
to
Michigan
J.
Frog
from
the
classic
Warner
Bros.
short
One
Froggy
Evening
.
A
side-by-side
comparison
can
be
seen
here
.
When
Kog'Maw
is
reviving
(
Zilean's
Chrono
Shift
or
Guardian
Angel
),
his
passive
does
not
proc,
and
his
otherwise
unused
death
animation
will
be
shown.
Kog'Maw
was
one
of
the
champions
chosen
for
the
Noxian
pool
available
during
the
Ionia
vs.
Noxus
match
.
He
was
not
one
of
the
selected
champions
however.
Kog'Maw
is
one
of
the
four
champions
to
have
abilities
which
allow
them
to
continue
to
attack
after
death.
Kog'Maw's
ability
being
Icathian
Surprise
and
the
others
being
Karthus's
Death
Defied
,
Yorick's
Omen
of
Death
and
Zyra's
Rise
of
the
Thorns
.
Kog'Maw
is
the
only
Void-related
champion
to
not
have
the
word
"Void"
in
his
title.
In
his
idle
animation,
Kog'Maw
blinks
one
eye
at
a
time.
He
will
also
perform
a
brief
spin/dance
that
is
different
than
his
actual
/dance
emote
sometimes.
It
is
most
likely
meant
to
resemble
a
dog
chasing
his
own
tail.
Quotes
According
to
Kog'Maw's
2nd
/taunt
line
and
the
Journal
of
Justice
Issue
2
,
another
Void
Champion
may
be
on
the
way.
Due
to
the
time
passed,
this
information
may
be
heavily
outdated.
Kog'Maw's
standard
joke
is
similar
to
the
bugle
charge
command.
The
Reindeer
Kog'Maw
skin
does
a
different
/joke
from
his
others.
It
will
sing
"Fa
la
la
la
la"
and,
paired
with
Silent
Night
Sona's
/joke,
will
sing
the
song
Deck
the
Halls
.
Skins
Kog'Maw's
champion
select
icon
and
mini-map
icon
have
his
"tongue"
darkened,
and
almost
not
noticeable.
The
backdrop
is
also
darker.
His
Classic
skin
art
appears
pink
but
is
actually
silver
colored
ingame.
The
Sonoran
Kog'Maw
skin,
while
colored
red
and
black
in
the
splash
art,
actually
appears
gold
and
blue
in-game.
In
the
Caterpillar
Kog'Maw
skin
he
is
hunting
a
scarab
in
the
US
version,
while
he
is
hunting
a
butterfly
on
the
Chinese
one.
The
Lion
Dance
Kog'Maw
skin
is
a
reference
to
the
traditional
Chinese
Lion
dances
,
performed
on
the
Lunar
New
Year.
The
visuals
of
his
autoattacks
and
ultimate
are
altered
to
display
fireworks
instead.
Deep
Sea
Kog'Maw
skin
is
based
on
the
real
world
Anglerfish
,
a
fish
that
dwells
in
the
deep
sea.
Kog'Maw
and
Cho'Gath
share
a
Jurassic
skin
theme.
In
the
background
of
the
splash
art,
the
skeleton
on
the
wall
beside
Kog'Maw
bears
resemblance
to
Omen
,
a
cancelled
champion.
Also
on
the
left
of
Kog'Maw
is
one
of
the
limbs
of
the
Jurassic
Cho'Gath
Exhibit.
A
Battlecast
Kog'Maw
skin
has
been
hinted
at.
The
Battlecast
Prime
Cho'Gath
teasers
included
serial
numbers
that
referenced
to
previous
and
possible
future
Battlecast
skin,
one
of
them
referencing
a
"
MAW
".
At
PAX
2013
IronStylus
sketched
an
unofficial
Battlecast-style
version
of
Kog'Maw,
using
his
classic
art
as
a
reference.
[1]
Creator
Viktor
'
s
splash
art
features
a
silhouette
that
looks
very
similar
to
Kog'Maw.
Reindeer
Kog'Maw
shares
a
duet
with
Silent
Night
Sona.
Playing
/j
together
they
make
a
melody
of
"Deck
the
Halls"
Relations
Kog'Maw,
Kha'Zix
,
Cho'Gath
and
Vel'Koz
are
creatures
from
the
Void.
Kog'Maw
was
enticed
into
joining
the
League
by
Malzahar
.
Kog'Maw
claims
to
have
a
"Daddy"
that
is
coming
to
Runeterra
,
now
believed
to
be
Vel'koz
.
