Movement
speed
is
a
champion
statistic
that
represents
the
rate
at
which
a
champion
travels
across
a
map
.
One
movement
speed
point
translates
to
one
game
distance
unit
traveled
per
second
(as
a
frame
of
reference,
Ashe's
basic
attack
has
a
range
of
600
game
distance
units).
For
example,
A
champion
with
300
movement
speed
(half
of
Ashe's
range)
will
take
2
seconds
to
travel
that
distance.
Each
champion
begins
the
game
with
a
particular
base
movement
speed,
ranging
from
325
(e.g.
Anivia
and
Nautilus
)
to
355
(
Master
Yi
and
Pantheon
)
units
per
second.
For
a
list
of
all
champions'
base
movement
speed,
see
base
champion
statistics
.
This
base
movement
speed
can
be
increased
by
flat
bonuses
and
percentage
bonuses
and
reduced
by
slows.
These
effects
can
come
from
items,
champion
abilities,
spells,
masteries,
runes
or
neutral
buffs.
Calculations
A
champion's
movement
speed
is
given
by
the
following
formula:
(Base
Movement
Speed
+
Flat
Movement
Bonuses)
×
(1
+
Percentage
Movement
Bonuses)
×
(Slow
Ratio
×
Slow
Resist
Ratio)
Diminishing
returns
are
then
applied
to
the
result.
Flat
bonuses
are
applied
first,
then
percent
bonuses
and
slows,
then
diminishing
returns.
Because
bonuses
and
slows
are
applied
to
each
other,
a
champion
affected
by
a
20%
bonus
and
a
20%
slow
still
has
a
net
reduced
movement
speed
(e.g.
300
×
1.
2
×
0.
8
=
288).
Movement
speed
caps
When
the
raw
movement
speed
is
greater
than
415,
there
are
two
soft
caps
applied:
The
raw
speed
between
415
and
490
gets
multiplied
by
80%.
The
raw
speed
over
490
gets
multiplied
by
50%.
The
two
ranges
have
their
reductions
applied
at
the
same
time
before
being
added
back
together.
As
an
example,
if
the
calculated
raw
speed
is
600
before
soft
caps
kick
in,
it
is
reduced
to
(600
−
490)
×
0.
5
+
(490
−
415)
×
0.
8
+
415
=
530,
which
means
an
11.
7
%
reduction
of
the
original
movement
speed.
These
are
the
simplified
formulas:
If
the
raw
speed
is
415
or
under,
no
cap
is
applied.
If
the
raw
speed
is
between
415
and
490,
final
speed
is
soft
capped
to
RawMS
×
0.
8
+
83.
If
the
raw
speed
is
above
490,
final
speed
is
soft
capped
to
RawMS
×
0.
5
+
230.
When
the
raw
movement
speed
is
less
than
220
another
soft
cap
is
used:
If
the
raw
speed
below
220,
it
gets
multiplied
by
50%
and
added
to
110.
Example:
if
the
calculated
raw
speed
is
180
before
soft
caps
kick
in,
it
is
increased
to
180
×
0.
5
+
110
=
200.
Slow
stacking
Slowing
effects
follow
particular
rules
when
stacking:
If
a
champion
is
affected
by
multiple
slows,
the
strongest
one
will
be
fully
applied,
while
the
others
are
applied
sequentially
with
65%
reduced
effectiveness
down
to
35%
of
its
original
strength.
Slow
effects
derived
from
items
with
the
same
name
or
named
item
effect
do
NOT
stack,
even
when
coming
from
different
champions.
Only
the
strongest
item
slow
is
applied
at
any
moment.
The
exception
to
this
is
the
active
effect
of
Randuin's
Omen
,
Hextech
Gunblade
,
Blade
of
the
Ruined
King
and
Bilgewater
Cutlass
,
which
stacks
with
other
slowing
items
normally
because
they
are
considered
champion
abilities
for
slow
stacking
purposes.
Attacking
a
champion
with
the
Blessing
of
the
Lizard
Elder
buff
when
the
target
is
already
affected
by
that
slow
will
reapply
the
debuff,
resetting
its
duration.
It
will
NOT
increase
the
slow
amount.
The
same
holds
true
for
the
Exhaust
summoner
spell
.
Example
A
champion
with
a
raw
movement
speed
of
400
is
affected
by
a
2
second
long
40%
slow
and
a
5
second
long
20%
slow
at
the
same
time.
For
the
first
two
seconds,
he
will
have
(1
−
0.
4
)
×
(1
−
0.
2
×
0.
35
)
=
0.
6
×
0.
93
=
55.
8
%
of
his
original
movement
speed
(a
44.
2
%
effective
slow).
So
he
will
have
400
×
0.
558
=
223.
2
raw
movement
speed.
For
the
following
three
seconds,
the
effective
slow
will
be
20%
and
so
he
will
have
400
×
0.8
=
320
movement
speed.
After
that,
he
will
return
to
his
normal
speed
of
400.
Slow
Resist
Slow
Resist
is
a
statistic
that
reduces
the
effectiveness
of
slows
by
a
percentage.
It
may
currently
only
be
gained
by
the
Swiftness
mastery
,
Boots
of
Swiftness
and
Sejuani's
Frost
Armor
.
Slow
Resist
stacks
multiplicatively
.
Example
A
champion
with
Boots
of
Swiftness
and
a
movement
speed
of
400
is
affected
by
a
40%
slow
will
have
a
movement
speed
of
400
×
(1
−
(0.
4
×
0.
75
))
=
280,
which
is
equal
to
a
30%
slow
without
slow
resist.
Increasing
flat
movement
speed
The
bonus
given
by
these
items
or
champion
abilities
are
flat
increases
to
the
champion's
base
movement
speed.
These
flat
bonuses
will
increase
the
effectiveness
of
percentage
bonuses.
Purchasing
boots
from
the
store
grants
a
champion
a
flat
increase
in
movement
speed.
Champions
cannot
buy
more
than
one
set
of
boots.
The
bonus
from
boots
is
quite
big
compared
to
their
cost
and
is
essential
for
all
champions.
