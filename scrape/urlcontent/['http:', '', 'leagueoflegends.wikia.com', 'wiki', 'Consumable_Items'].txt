Trivia
Over
the
2010
Harrowing
,
several
of
the
consumables
had
their
icons
changed
for
the
holiday:
Elixirs
were
candies,
Mana
Potion
was
changed
to
Mana-Encrusted
Apple,
and
Health
Potion
was
changed
to
Candy
Corn.
With
the
Harrowing
items,
there
was
an
occasional
glitch
where
a
player
could
use
their
consumables
on
another
player,
however
it
would
still
be
used
on
themselves.
During
the
2010
Snowdown
Showdown
,
Health
Potions
became
Eggnog
Health
Potions
and
Mana
Potions
became
Eggnog
Mana
Potions.
