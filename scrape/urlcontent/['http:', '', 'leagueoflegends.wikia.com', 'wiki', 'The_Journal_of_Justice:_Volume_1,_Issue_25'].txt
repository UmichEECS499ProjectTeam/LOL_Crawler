War
in
Kalamanda
Noxus
and
Demacia
in
breach
of
armistice
Quinton
Groat
reporting
from
Kalamanda
Prince
Jarvan
IV
and
General
Swain
battle
amidst
the
chaos
erupting
in
Kalamanda.
The
collective
fears
of
Valoran
have
been
realized
in
Kalamanda
as
the
standoff
between
Noxus
and
Demacia
has
escalated
to
all-out
war.
Initial
estimates
put
casualties
in
the
hundreds,
with
reports
continuing
to
flood
in.
The
High
Councilors
of
the
League
of
Legends
called
for
an
emergency
assembly
of
League
and
city-state
representatives
as
soon
as
fighting
broke
out,
but
they
have
yet
to
release
an
official
statement.
It
appears
that
Prince
Jarvan
IV
of
Demacia
struck
the
first
blow
against
General
Swain
of
Noxus.
According
to
eyewitnesses,
Swain
was
making
his
usual
rounds
of
the
Noxian
camp
when
he
was
ambushed
by
Jarvan,
who
was
lurking
in
shadows
nearby.
The
two
became
locked
in
combat,
and
soldiers
from
both
camps
immediately
engaged
each
other
in
efforts
to
come
to
their
aid.
“Jarvan
has
always
been
a
bit
of
a
hothead,
but
it’s
hard
to
imagine
him
starting
the
fight
with
stakes
like
these,”
commented
Tryndamere
,
who
has
recently
been
in
negotiations
with
Demacia
following
Freljord's
ascension
to
city-state
status.
“Those
two
have
always
had
a
special
hatred
for
each
other
though,
if
anyone
would
get
to
him,
it
would
be
Swain.”
Though
battle
between
these
embittered
rivals
has
been
heated,
ambassadors
from
both
sides
have
pledged
that
their
forces
will
refrain
from
the
use
of
unsanctioned
magic.
Chancellor
Malek
Hawkmoon,
spokesman
for
Noxus,
called
it
a
“steel
and
slugs”
engagement,
employing
the
Noxian
military
term
for
a
physical-only
wartime
operation.
This
doesn’t
offer
much
reassurance
to
neighboring
villages,
but
it
has
bought
the
League
some
breathing
space
while
it
strategizes
a
response.
Neither
army
appears
to
have
gained
a
significant
advantage
over
the
other.
The
bulk
of
the
fighting
has
taken
place
on
the
fields
just
outside
the
village’s
primary
dig
site,
but
the
contested
area
is
gradually
expanding.
Prince
Jarvan
hasn’t
been
seen
on
the
battlefield
since
his
initial
clash
with
Swain,
but
Noxus’
Master
Tactician
has
stridden
the
front
lines,
issuing
commands
and
urging
his
troops
onward.
Jarvan’s
absence
has
caused
a
great
degree
of
speculation
that
the
Prince
may
have
been
killed
or
captured,
but
Demacian
forces
have
not
faltered.
Their
morale
has
been
bolstered
by
Garen
and
the
Dauntless
Vanguard,
whose
efforts
have
stymied
the
Noxian
offensive
at
nearly
every
turn.
King
Jarvan
III
has
reportedly
donned
his
own
royal
armor,
although
his
exact
position
remains
a
mystery.
Wherever
he
is,
it’s
fair
to
say
Xin
Zhao
is
at
his
side.
The
League
has
been
somewhat
tight-lipped
about
its
reaction
to
this
tragic
turn
of
events,
but
High
Councilor
Heywan
Relivash
has
promised
that
he
plans
to
respond
with
“swift
and
decisive”
action.
Noxian
High
Command
in
Turmoil
Successor
to
General
Boram
Darkwill
Unclear
Kaldera
Carnadine
reporting
from
the
Institute
of
War
Since
the
death
of
Boram
Darkwill
two
weeks
ago,
Noxian
High
Command
has
existed
in
a
state
of
unrest
and
contention.
Despite
raging
debates,
the
successor
to
the
Grand
General’s
empty
seat
remains
unclear.
According
to
Noxian
scholars,
the
Grand
Generals
of
Noxus
have
historically
risen
to
power
through
unrivaled
military
success
and
support.
However,
Boram
Darkwill’s
unusually
long
reign
saw
the
creation
of
the
League
of
Legends.
“With
the
oversight
of
the
Institute
of
War,
we
have
fallen
upon
a
time
of
relative
peace,”
said
Chancellor
Malek
Hawkmoon.
“The
role
of
High
Command
has
changed.
We
negotiate,
we
manage
the
provinces
and
territories
under
the
Noxian
banner,
we
govern.
We
are
peacekeepers.
It
is
difficult
to
evaluate
any
one
General
without
the
visceral
results
that
war
once
gave
us.”
At
the
head
of
the
dispute
is
the
late
Grand
General’s
youngest
son,
Keiran
Darkwill.
While
he
does
not
hold
a
General’s
rank,
he
has
an
impressive
military
record.
Keiran
oversaw
Noxus’
acquisition
of
Askay
and
Meland
last
year
and
is
also
responsible
for
driving
back
the
minotaur
tribes
of
the
Great
Barrier.
“With
the
situation
in
Kalamanda
grown
dire,
we
have
no
time
for
games,”
said
Keiran.
“It
is
only
right
that
the
seat
of
the
Grand
General
remains
with
the
Darkwill
line.”
Darkwill’s
eldest
son,
Draythe,
has
yet
to
address
the
public
following
his
father’s
death.
While
Keiran
Darkwill
does
hold
a
strong
following,
he
is
not
without
opposition.
The
death
of
Boram
Darkwill
has
revived
investigation
of
General
Du
Couteau’s
disappearance,
an
effort
driven
by
his
daughters,
Katarina
and
Cassiopeia
.
General
Du
Couteau
was
largely
considered
Boram
Darkwill’s
most
trusted
and
skilled
General
until
he
vanished
late
last
year.
“If
my
father
were
here
today,
he
would
stand
the
undisputed
successor
to
Darkwill,”
commented
Katarina.
“It
is
too
great
a
coincidence
to
ignore
that
the
two
most
powerful
men
in
Noxus
have
been
removed
from
their
positions
in
so
short
a
span
of
time.”
Even
as
High
Command
remains
in
turmoil,
a
great
deal
of
interest
lies
with
General
Jericho
Swain.
As
a
League
of
Legends
champion,
he
remains
the
most
recognizable
face
of
Noxian
High
Command
and
his
military
record
is
exceptional.
“Even
in
his
absence,
members
of
High
Command
have
voiced
support
to
his
name,”
Hawkmoon
said.
“As
it
stands,
Jericho
Swain
is
the
presiding
General
on
Noxus’
only
warfront.
That
is
more
than
most
Generals
can
boast.”
General
Swain,
occupied
in
Kalamanda,
could
not
be
reached
for
comment.
Zaun
Clears
Trade
Lanes
for
Noxian
Navy
Dirigible
service
opens
for
merchant
deliveries
Cpt.
Morgan
Rackham
reporting
from
Zaun
Blimey!
It’s
a
blustery
day
here
at
the
port
in
the
city-state
of
Zaun
.
Shame
that
every
sailing
vessel
not
flying
a
black
pennant
has
her
sails
furled
up
tighter
than
the
bark
on
a
tree!
See,
Zaun
ordered
that
the
shipping
lanes
be
cleared
while
a
Noxian
convoy
takes
on
merchandise
and
gets
headed
back
towards
the
home
country.
While
this
means
the
dockside
is
busier
than
a
handsome
barmaid
back
home
in
Bilgewater
,
it
also
means
that
every
honest
sailor
unfortunate
enough
to
drop
anchor
in
Zaun
since
the
regrettable
business
with
the
late,
great
Boram
Darkwill
might
as
well
be
in
dry
dock.
Despite
assurances
from
Zaun’s
Board
of
Directors
that
they
aren’t
involved
in
trading
wartime
supplies,
the
streets
have
been
positively
buzzing
with
rumors
concerning
what
might
be
boarding
a
fleet
of
Noxian
state
ships
that’s
so
important
they
don’t
want
anyone
else’s
vessels
moored
within
spitting
distance.
The
Noxians
haven’t
exactly
been
forthcoming
with
information
on
what
they
happen
to
be
transporting
out
of
Runeterra's
fair
industrial
paradise,
either.
Suffice
to
say
that
–
given
that
this
is
Zaun
–
it
could
be
just
about
anything.
One
thing’s
for
certain,
however:
whatever
it
is,
Noxus
and
Zaun
are
willing
to
disrupt
open
trade
with
a
number
of
other
nations
to
ensure
that
it
makes
it
out
to
sea
without
incident.
The
ports
haven’t
been
this
empty
of
merchant
ships
since
the
last
time
Piltover
and
Zaun
were
launching
warships
across
the
bay
at
one
another!
Matter
of
fact,
the
only
blighter
outside
the
Noxian
Navy
that’s
still
loading
freight
on
a
day
like
today
is
an
eccentric
chap
by
the
name
of
Darin
the
Daring
who
owns
a
blimp
tourism
service
on
the
outskirts
of
the
city.
The
chant
is
that
the
bloke’s
fond
of
boasting
that
he
once
defeated
Janna,
the
Storm’s
Fury
,
in
a
zeppelin
race.
While
he’s
probably
more
pumped
full
of
hot
air
than
one
of
his
balloons,
the
cheeky
little
upstart’s
all
there
enough
to
have
the
presence
of
mind
to
retrofit
his
fleet
to
profit
from
the
shipping
crisis.
He’s
got
every
merchant
worried
about
making
his
quota
lined
up
down
the
street
trying
to
book
their
cargo
out
for
a
trip
on
one
of
his
blimps!
And
while
he’s
prospering
in
the
meantime,
it’s
certainly
not
making
him
any
friends
down
on
the
waterfront.
If
being
landlocked
isn’t
enough
to
get
a
get
an
honest
sailor
fuming,
being
laid
up
with
a
bad
case
of
cabin
fever
watching
Darin’s
Daring
Dirigible
Delivery
cruise
off
with
your
profits
is
bound
to
raise
a
few
pulses.
Presently,
this
particular
string
of
cancelled
shipments
has
only
resulted
in
a
long
series
of
benders
and
perhaps
a
few
honest
brawls
between
seamen.
But
the
tensions
still
mounting,
and
there’s
no
telling
what
a
good
and
honorable
mariner
might
get
himself
up
to
after
he’s
been
sat
landlocked
in
a
dockside
tavern
for
a
bit
too
long.

Senior
Summoner
Ralston
Farnsley
commenting
from
the
Institute
of
War
To
our
faithful
readers:
with
the
assassination
of
Boram
Darkwill,
we
mourn
a
world
leader
who
stood,
at
the
founding
of
the
League
of
Legends,
a
pioneer
of
progress.
The
Grand
General
put
aside
the
aspirations
of
Noxus
for
the
greater
good
of
us
all.
Today,
we
bear
witness
to
the
first
open
warfare
on
Valoran’s
soil
since
the
day
of
founding
twenty-one
years
ago.
In
these
dire
times,
dear
readers,
stay
strong
and
have
faith:
the
League
of
Legends
stands
an
indomitable
and
unwavering
guardian
of
this
land.
You
will
be
protected.
“My
question
is
addressed
to
Master
Yi
.
Your
will
for
the
preservation
of
the
Wuju
style
deserves
the
utmost
admiration
as
many
who
would
face
the
trials
that
you
have
would
merely
crumble
while
you
choose
to
face
them
unwavering
in
the
face
of
adversity.
However
there
is
one
such
trial
that
you
have
yet
to
face:
Time.
As
all
in
existence
knows,
time
is
ever
flowing
and
although
it
can
be
manipulated
through
magic
it
is
never
be
driven
from
its
course.
I
am
sure
that
one
with
such
awareness
as
you
should
have
already
contemplated
that
time
is
your
greatest
enemy
against
your
will
for
preservation
of
the
Wuju
style
since
you
are
but
the
only
one
left
preserving
it.
I
was
wondering
if
you
are
considering
taking
on
a
disciple
so
that
you
may
pass
on
your
skills
to
another
so
that
Wuju
may
continue
to
live
on,
or
maybe
you
already
have
a
disciple
that
we
are
not
aware
of:
a
secret
apprentice?”
–
J.R
Kishi
Master
Yi
often
spends
his
time
meditating
and
training
near
the
Great
Barrier
south
of
the
Institute
of
War.
I
managed
to
intercept
him
on
his
way
to
one
of
these
sessions.
The
Wuju
Bladesman,
with
a
knowing
smirk,
offered
this
answer
to
your
question:
“I
suppose
it
will
not
remain
a
secret
forever.
The
tenets
of
Wuju
dictate
that
a
master
must
not
seek
an
apprentice.
Rather,
the
apprentice
must
come
to
the
master.
As
the
last
disciple
of
Wuju
style,
I
struggled
with
this
tenet
for
many
years,
but
patience
has
served
me
well.
My
apprentice
has
come
to
me.
Wuju
will
live
on.”
“
Rumble
is
great.
I've
always
been
a
decent
Rumble
summoner
and
now
I
ask
him
this
question.
Are
you
able
to
upgrade
Tristy
to
a
less
rusted
up
state?
I
mean,
the
League
would
have
to
allow
some
kind
of
payment
or
materials
you
can
use
to
turn
Tristy
into
a
real
terror
on
the
battlefield.
She
seems
very
flimsy
when
not
paired
with
support.
(Also,
I
was
wondering
if
you
had
a
crush
on
Tristana
.
Just
because
you're
both
from
Bandle
City
and
your
machine
shares
a
similar
name...)“
–
B.R.
Rumble
recently
established
a
workshop
at
the
Institute
of
War
to
occupy
during
his
stays
here,
and
I
must
say
he’s
been
one
of
our
most
vocal
residents.
As
I
entered
his
workshop,
a
potato
whizzed
past
my
head
and
spattered
into
the
hallway
beyond,
launched
by
what
appeared
to
be
a
stack
of
bottomless
pots
and
pans,
a
dislodged
kitchen
sink,
and
a
burnt
fuse.
Rumble
called
it
a
“test
model.”
“Tristy?
What
do
you
mean,
‘a
less
rusted
state?’
She’s
perfect
just
the
way
she
is!
I’ve
already
had
more
than
one
complaint
about
how
strong
I
built
her.
It’s
just
like
I
said:
Tristy’s
real
yordle
tech.
Even
if
she
could
get
any
stronger,
she’d
wreck
anyone
who
came
within
three
feet
of
her!
And,
um…
your
second
question…
I-I
don’t
know
what
you’re
talking
about!”
“In
my
travels,
I
met
some
of
the
Rakkor,
but
despite
being
flattered
to
learn
that
my
favorite
champion
is
Pantheon
,
they
did
not
want
to
clear
my
doubts
about
the
people
and
the
traditions
of
the
Rakkor.
My
question
is:
Who
gave
you
your
weapons,
Pantheon?
And
how
was
your
training
until
you
left
Mt.
Targon
?”
–
Dewars
With
Leona's
acceptance
into
the
League
of
Legends,
the
subject
of
the
Rakkor
has
come
up
frequently
at
the
Institute.
The
Artisan
of
War
was
eager
to
offer
you
a
response:
“The
Rakkor
have
no
concept
of
‘training.’
For
my
people,
what
you
call
‘training’
is
the
height
of
childhood
experience.
We
relish
the
day
we
first
enter
the
arena
with
our
peers,
wielding
wooden
shields,
spears
and
swords.
We
live
for
the
dream
of
one
day
receiving
a
relic-weapon.
Mine—my
spear
and
shield—belonged
to
a
warrior
called
Zeonia
long
ago.
One
day,
when
I
die
in
glorious
battle,
they
will
be
passed
on
again.”
