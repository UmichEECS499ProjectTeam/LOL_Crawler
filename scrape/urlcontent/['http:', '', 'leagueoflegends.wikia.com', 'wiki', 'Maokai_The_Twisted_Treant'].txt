not
consumed

Maokai
when

Ability
Details
Twisted
Advance
is
a
targeted
dash
.
Applies
spell
effects
as
a
single
target
ability.
Spell
vamp
is
fully
applied.
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
will
apply
a
35%
slow.
Magic
damage
will
be
mitigated
by
Black
Shield
and
Lifeline
.
Spell
shields
will
block
Twisted
Advance.
Additional
Information:
Twisted
Advance
will
cancel
mid-dash
if
the
target
dies
or
becomes
untargetable.
Maokai
will
continue
to
chase
his
target
even
if
he
loses
sight
of
them.
There
is
an
occasional
bug
where
losing
sight
of
his
target
causes
the
animation
to
freeze
mid-air.
Despite
how
it
looks,
Maokai
will
continue
to
chase
his
target
and
Maokai
will
"blink"
to
where
he
should
be
once
he
arrives
at
his
target.
Maokai
will
follow
any
dash
ability,
with
the
exception
of
Paranoia
,
Gate
,
Stand
United
and
Teleport
.
Becoming
untargetable
will
prevent
damage
from
non-targeted
spells,
such
as
Requiem
,
as
well
as
dropping
aggro
from
turrets
and
AI
units.
Maokai
will
safely
pass
through
Jinx
Flame
Chompers!
Possible
Bug:
Maokai
is
able
to
interact
with
Dark
Passage
as
he
passes
over
it.
His
target
will
become
rooted
when
Maokai
arrives
at
Thresh's
location,
allowing
him
to
"safely"
root
people
(i.e.
root
without
jumping
in).

After
a

delay
after

the

nearby
enemies.

Ghouls
,
Saplings
will
continue
to
chase
their
target

will
not
change
focus
after

invulnerable,
but
will
appear
on
the
map
as
a
minion.
