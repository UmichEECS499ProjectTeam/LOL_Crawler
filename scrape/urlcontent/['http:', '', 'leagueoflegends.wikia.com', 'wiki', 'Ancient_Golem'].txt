The
Ancient
Golem
is
a
neutral
monster
in
League
of
Legends
described
in
game
as
"A
tough
monster
that
attacks
with
slow
but
punishing
blows.
Slaying
this
foe
greatly
increases
mana
regeneration
and
reduces
cooldowns."
It
only
appears
on
Summoner's
Rift
,
where
it
spawns
with
two
Young
Lizards
.
The
Ancient
Golem
is
referred
to
by
most
players
as
the
"
blue
buff
",
the
color
of
the
effect
ring
you
get
if
you
have
the
buff
acquired
by
killing
it.
Imbued
by
the
power
of
the
Nexus
,
the
planet
itself
rises
up
to
bring
forth
a
protector
of
its
lands.
The
Stone
Golems
roam
the
forests
of
Summoner's
Rift
,
imbued
with
the
strength
of
the
Nexus
and
acting
against
any
who
disturb
the
peaceful
wake
of
this
isolated
battleground.
When
killed,
the
Ancient
Golem
grants
the
Crest
of
the
Ancient
Golem
buff
to
its
killer,
which
increases
his/her
mana
regeneration
/
energy
and
cooldown
reduction
.
Strategy
Killing
the
Golem
and
one
of
its
little
lizards
grants
enough
experience
to
go
from
level
1
(with
0
experience)
to
level
2
(provided
the
experience
is
not
shared
with
allies).
Many
jungling
paths
kill
the
Golem
first
due
to
the
large
boost
in
overall
speed
it
gives.
A
dedicated
Jungle
Shaco
can
kill
the
Golem
at
level
1
without
using
Smite
,
provided
he
has
at
least
three
Jack
in
the
Boxes
stacked
before
the
buff
spawns.
By
immediately
heading
to
red
buff
and
using
Smite
,
a
jungling
Shaco
can
acquire
both
buffs
very
early
in
the
game,
making
him
one
of
the
most
deadly
early
game
gankers.
By
saving
smite
as
detailed
above,
Shaco
can
also
head
straight
for
the
enemy
red
buff
to
attempt
to
steal
it.
Because
of
Shaco's
ridiculously
fast
blue
clear
time,
many
times
this
results
in
success.
Ganking
at
the
Golem
is
common
in
mid-level
or
higher
play
if
only
the
jungler
is
present.
It's
recommended
to
wait
until
the
enemy
team
has
arrived
in
their
lane,
or
start
somewhere
else
if
you're
unsure.
Controlling
the
Golem
buffs
can
give
your
team
an
advantage
in
the
match.
Most
junglers
will
attempt
to
control
not
only
their
own
but
also
the
opposing
team's
golem
buff.
The
golem
spawn
is
indicated
by
a
gold
marker
on
the
minimap.
If
your
team
has
vision
when
or
after
the
golem
is
killed,
the
marker
will
reappear
when
the
camp
respawns.
The
golem
respawns
despite
the
buff
still
being
around,
so
there
can
be
more
than
two
'buffed'
players
active
on
the
map
at
any
given
time.
The
same
applies
for
the
Lizard.
The
golem
buff's
duration
resets
upon
transfer
to
a
new
champion.
The
golem
does
not
respawn
if
the
little
lizards
are
not
killed.
Use
this
knowledge
to
your
advantage
when
determining
whether
or
not
to
kill
the
little
lizards
in
the
enemy
jungle.
