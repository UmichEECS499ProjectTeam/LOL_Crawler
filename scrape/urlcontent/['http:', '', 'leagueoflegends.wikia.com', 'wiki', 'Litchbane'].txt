For

the

effect
must
be
worth
at
least
463g.

Notes
The
lowest
base
movement
speed
in
the
game
is
325.
At
this
speed,
Lich
Bane
grants
16.25
movement
speed.
The
movement
speed
stat
only
increases
flat
movement
speed,
and
will
not
interact
with
other
percentage
increases.
Lich
Bane
's
passive
is
considered
an
on-hit
effect
and,
as
such,
is
capable
of
being
applied
to
skills
such
as
Ezreal's
Mystic
Shot
and
Gangplank's
Parrrley
,
which
effectively
adds
a
50%
AP
ratio
to
those
abilities
in
addition
to
their
natural
AD/AP
ratios.
Lich
Bane
scales
with
ability
power
while
Trinity
Force
scales
with
base
attack
damage
.
For
some
hybrid
champions,
it
may
be
better
to
buy
Lich
Bane
because
once
the
champion
reaches
level
18,
it
becomes
impossible
to
increase
the
damage
from
Trinity
Force
with
items
compared
to
Lich
Bane
.
The
proc
from
Lich
Bane
far
surpasses
Trinity
Force
with
a
Rabadon's
Deathcap
alone
on
the
majority
of
champions,
not
to
mention
other
AP
items.
The
highest
Trinity
Force
is
of
260,
achieved
by
Cho'Gath
and
Skarner
at
level
18.
Lich
Bane
beats
it
out
even
on
those
champions
at
281
ability
power.
Lich
Bane
does
not
proc
spell
vamp
nor
lifesteal.
Lich
Bane
is
especially
deadly
if
combined
with
an
AA
modifier,
such
as
Mordekaiser's
Mace
of
Spades
or
Twisted
Fate's
Pick
A
Card
massively
increasing
the
AP
ratio
on
the
ability,
and
is
even
more
effective
if
the
user
can
force
the
use
only
minding
the
2
second
cooldown.
Similar
to
Trinity
Force
,
Lich
Bane
synergizes
well
with
cooldown
reduction
,
enabling
champions
to
proc
the
bonus
damage
as
often
as
possible
while
minding
the
2
second
cooldown
;
the
10
second
bonus
damage
buff
does
not
stack.
Using
two
skills
in
quick
succession
will
not
accrue
two
stacks
of
bonus
damage,
but
one.
Lich
Bane's
proc
can
be
countered
by
Jax's
Counter
Strike
and
Fiora's
Riposte
.
The
effect
by
Lich
Bane
can
be
seen
on
the
champion
as
a
purple
glow.
For
example,
Kog'Maw
will
have
a
glowing
mouth,
Shaco
will
have
glowing
hands,
and
Master
Yi
will
have
a
glowing
sword,
etc.
The
glow
only
appears
after
using
an
ability.
The
same
thing
will
occur
with
Sheen
,
Iceborn
Gauntlet
and
Trinity
Force
.
You
can
easily
distinguish
between
Lich
Bane
buff
and
that
of
the
other
items
by
looking
at
the
color.
The
particle
from
Sheen
and
Trinity
Force
is
bright
red
and
it
leaves
a
small
trail.
The
particle
from
Iceborn
Gauntlet
is
bright
blue.
The
particle
from
Lich
Bane
is
bright
purple.
