Ability
Details
Summon
Voidling
is
a
passive
ability
that
gains
a
charge
every
time
Malzahar
uses
a
champion
ablity.
After
gaining
3
charges,
Malzahar's
next
ability
cast
will
consume
the
charges
to
summon
a
Voidling
pet
.
Additional
Information:
Summon
Voidling
does
not
list
in
the
tooltip
that
it
scales
with
Malzahar's
bonus
attack
damage,
nor
does
the
Voidling's
stats
reflect
the
additional
damage.
When
Malzahar
dies,
any
active
voidling
will
also
die.
Possible
Bug:
When
Malzahar
dies,
any
active
Voidlings
will
become
idle
for
the
rest
of
their
lifespan.
Occasionally,
if
Voidlings
have
an
attack
target
when
Malzahar
dies,
they
will
continue
to
chase
their
target
-
but
they
will
not
deal
damage.

Ability
Details
Nether
Grasp
is
a
channeled
tether-like
damage
over
time
ability.
While
in
range
of
the
tether,
the
target
takes
magic
damage
every
0.5
seconds.
Both
the
suppression
and
tether
are
removed
if
the
channel
is
stopped
or
interrupted.
Applies
spell
effects
as
a
damage
over
time
ability.
Spell
vamp
is
fully
applied.
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
will
apply
a
15%
slow.
Magic
damage
will
be
mitigated
by
Black
Shield
and
Lifeline
.
Spell
shields
will
block
the
damage
and
prevent
the
tether.
Additional
Information:
Nether
Grasp's
suppression
can
be
removed
with
abilities
like
Unbreakable
Will
and
Remove
Scurvy
,
and
by
Quicksilver
Sash
.
Nether
Grasp's
suppression
and
tethered
damage
effects
are
separate.
If
the
suppression
is
removed,
Nether
Grasp
will
continue
to
deal
damage
unless
the
channel
is
interrupted
or
the
tether
is
broken
by
moving
away.
Probably
Bug:
Olaf's
Ragnarok
will
remove
both
the
suppression
and
the
tethered
damage,
and
it
will
also
prevent
Malzahar
from
forming
the
tether
if
Ragnarok
is
already
active
(putting
Nether
Grasp
on
cooldown
with
no
effect).
Like
all
channeled
abilities,
Nether
Grasp
will
be
interrupted
by
hard
crowd
control
like
stuns
and
silences
,
and
will
end
prematurely
if
Malzahar
attempts
another
action,
e.g.
moving
or
casting
other
abilities.
Malzahar
can
still
use
summoner
spells
(excluding
Flash
and
Teleport
)
and
item
activatables
without
interrupting
the
channel
provided
that
Malzahar
does
not
need
to
move
to
use
them.
Malzahar
is
unable
to
make
actions
for
the
first
0.5
seconds
of
the
ability
to
prevent
Malzahar
from
accidentally
cancelling
his
ultimate.
This
was
made
due
to
high
community
demand,
as
the
accident
was
often
between
players
who
like
to
click
too
much.
The
target
of
Nether
Grasp
may
themselves
interrupt
the
channeling,
if
their
crowd
control
abilities
are
mid-flight
or
cannot
be
interrupted.
