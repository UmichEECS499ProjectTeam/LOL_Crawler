Harass
Harassment
(or
Harass
)
is
the
act
of
constantly
disturbing
an
enemy
champion
in
lane
while
allowing
them
minimal
chance
to
counter
this
(and
punishing
any
attempts
to
do
so).
The
harassing
champion
(harasser)
receives
minor
advantages
in
the
process
which
accumulate,
granting
early
and
midgame
superiority.
Methods
of
Harassing
It
is
possible
to
harass
enemy
champions
by
using
normal
attacks
or
certain
abilities
.
Thus,
not
all
champions
are
potent
of
harassing
effectively
while
others
excel
at
it.
The
basic
ways
of
harassing
are:
Zoning
-
using
abilities
to
impede
the
enemy's
positioning
or
to
force
him
to
either
move
to
or
retreat
from
a
certain
location.
An
easy
example
is
Cassiopeia's
Miasma
.
Debuffing
-
repeatedly
applying
crowd
control
to
an
enemy
champion,
occassionally
combined
with
damaging
spells
or
basic
attacks
for
the
duration,
forcing
him
to
retreat
from
combat.
Kiting
-
by
simply
having
a
higher
attack
range,
you
can
constantly
land
"free
hits"
on
the
enemy
champion
and
just
retreat
each
time
they
try
to
close
up
in
order
to
counter-attack.
This
can
be
done
with
high
range
abilities
as
well.
"Hit
and
Run"
-
melee-champions
who
feature
abilities
to
quickly
dive
in
and
out
of
combat
can
harass
by
getting
into
range,
landing
a
few
basic
attacks
or
abilities
and
then
retreating
before
the
enemy
champion
can
react
(such
as
Renekton's
Slice
and
Dice
or
Lee
Sin
).
This
works
best
if
you
know
that
the
enemy's
abilities
which
would
punish
getting
close
to
him
are
on
cooldown
.
Consequences
The
most
common
goal
of
harassing
is
to
force
the
enemy
to
retreat
or
stay
at
a
distance.
This
pushes
the
harassed
player
into
an
uncomfortable
situation:
either
he
or
she
stays
away
from
the
harasser,
eventually
losing
minion
kills,
gold
and
experience
,
or
if
he
or
she
tries
to
close
up
and
is
punished
with
debuffs,
damage
or
even
ends
up
being
killed.
While
putting
the
harassed
player
under
time-pressure
(since,
if
harassed
too
long,
he
or
she
will
be
far
inferior
to
other
champions),
harassing
also
demotivates
the
victim
since
he
or
she
is
hardly
able
to
do
anything
about
it
on
his
or
her
own.
Countering
Since
there
are
a
variety
of
ways
to
harass,
there
is
not
one
ultimate
way
to
be
safe
against
all
kinds
of
harass.
Trying
to
buy
items
that
protect
from
the
form
of
harrass
you
are
facing
is
usually
hard
since
killing
minions
to
gain
gold
is
being
punished.
The
best
ways
to
properly
react
is
to
either
swap
lanes
with
an
allied
champion
who
is
not
(or
at
least
not
as
much)
impeded
by
that
form
of
harassment,
or
to
ask
your
teammates
for
help
and
try
to
kill
the
harasser
together.
Out
sustaining
your
harasser
is
also
a
good
tactic
as
some
champions
have
a
resource
system
like
mana
which
will
eventually
run
out.
Early
health
regeneration
,
life
steal
,
or
spell
vamp
items
will
negate
the
effects
of
harassment.
