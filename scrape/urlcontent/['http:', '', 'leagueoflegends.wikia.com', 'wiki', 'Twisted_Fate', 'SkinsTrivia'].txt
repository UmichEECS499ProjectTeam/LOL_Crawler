Trivia
Twisted
Fate
was
designed
by
Guinsoo
.
[1]
Twisted
Fate
is
voiced
by
Owen
Thomas
,
Who
also
voices
Viktor
.
Owen
stated
that
he
does
not
remember
giving
his
voice
to
Twisted
Fate
before
being
reminded
by
a
fan.
Twisted
Fate
used
to
come
from
Demacia
before
his
background
was
redone.
Twisted
Fate
is
frequently
compared
to
Gambit
from
the
X-Men
comics
for
his
weapon
of
choice,
throwing
cards,
as
well
as
his
manner
of
speaking.
Twisted
Fate
is
also
comparable
to
the
character
Luxord
from
the
Kingdom
Hearts
role-playing
series
in
his
gentlemanly
attitude
and
inventive
use
of
cards
as
weapons.
Additionally,
both
characters
possess
the
ability
to
disappear
in
a
stream
of
cards
and
reappear
elsewhere.
Twisted
Fate
was
one
of
the
first
six
characters
designed,
along
with
Singed
,
Annie
,
Sivir
,
Sion
and
Lee
Sin
.
[2]
[3]
On
the
artwork
of
many
skins,
the
cards
he
throws
can
be
seen
to
be
Tarot
cards
from
the
Major
Arcana
of
The
Terot
Twisted
Fate's
dance
is
a
reference
to
the
extremely
popular
song
Gangnam
Style
.
A
side-by-side
comparison
can
be
seen
here.
Twisted
Fate
is
the
third
champion
to
feature
vocals
during
his
dance:
the
first
being
Draven
and
the
second
being
Rengar
.
While
not
visible
due
to
the
fixed
camera
angle
in-game,
Twisted
Fate's
eyes
are
completely
cyan
(no
whites
or
pupil).
This
can
be
observed
by
examining
his
model
in
the
games
files,
by
panning
the
camera
in
spectator
mode
,or
by
looking
at
High
Noon
Twisted
Fate's
splash
art.
Skins
The
splash
art
for
PAX
2009
Twisted
Fate
and
The
Magnificent
Twisted
Fate
shows
him
using
Tarot
Cards
.
In
the
Chinese
splash
art,
High
Noon
Twisted
Fate
is
also
using
Tarot
Cards.
Although
The
Magnificent
Twisted
Fate
is
priced
as
a
legendary
skin,
it
has
no
new
particle
effects,
animations
or
dialogue.
The
artwork
for
The
Magnificent
Twisted
Fate
depicts
him
with
a
Fiendish
Codex
hanging
from
his
belt.
PAX
Twisted
Fate
has
the
PAX
logo
displayed
on
his
shoulder,
hat,
and
belt.
Twisted
Fate
and
Evelynn
have
matching
Tango
skins.
In
the
Chinese
artwork,
the
same
art
is
used
for
both
skins,
with
the
only
difference
being
the
position
of
the
spotlight.
The
cards
that
appear
when
Underworld
Twisted
Fate
uses
his
ult
have
the
same
symbol
on
them
that
Gatekeeper
Galio
bears
on
his
arms.
Jack
of
Hearts
Twisted
Fate
bears
a
striking
resemblance
to
the
Red
Mage
class
from
the
Final
Fantasy
series.
This
may
or
may
not
be
intentional.
Underworld
Twisted
Fate
bears
a
remarkable
resemblance
to
the
outfit
worn
by
Jericho
Cross
in
the
video
game
DarkWatch
(see
here
).
It
could
also
be
based
of
Gambit
of
the
X-men's
Horseman
of
Death
outfit
(see
here
)
Relations
Twisted
Fate
and
Evelynn
were
the
first
reported
couple
in
The
Journal
of
Justice,
Issue
1
.
However,
Evelynn
has
reportedly
ended
the
relationship
in
Issue
10
.
Twisted
Fate
and
Graves
were
partners
in
the
past.
That
is
until
Twisted
Fate
sold
out
Graves
to
Dr.
Priggs
in
exchange
for
a
risky
experiment
that
gave
Twisted
Fate
his
magical
abilities.
After
escaping
imprisonment,
Graves
now
seeks
payback
on
Twisted
Fate.
There
is
speculation
that
Twisted
Fate
is
the
cat
burglar
in
which
Caitlyn
is
attempting
to
track
down
and
arrest.
The
bandit,
who
always
leaves
a
card
with
an
ornate
"C"
at
the
scene
of
the
crime,
has
become
Caitlyn's
arch-nemesis.
