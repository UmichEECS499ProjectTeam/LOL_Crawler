On
every
wall
of
his
den,
the
trophy
hunter
Rengar
mounts
the
heads,
horns,
claws,
and
fangs
of
the
most
lethal
creatures
in
Valoran
.
Though
his
collection
is
extensive,
he
remains
unsatisfied,
tirelessly
seeking
greater
game.
He
takes
time
with
every
kill,
studying
his
prey,
learning,
and
preparing
himself
for
the
next
encounter
with
the
one
monster
he
never
managed
to
defeat.
Rengar
never
knew
his
real
parents,
but
was
raised
by
a
human
who
was
revered
as
a
legendary
hunter.
He
was
an
ideal
pupil,
intently
absorbing
the
lessons
of
his
father,
and
improving
them
with
his
uncanny
feral
instincts.
Before
his
mane
had
fully
grown,
Rengar
set
off
on
his
own
and
claimed
a
wide
territory
for
himself.
Along
its
perimeter,
he
mounted
the
skulls
of
his
slain
prey
-
a
warning
to
would-be
aggressors.
He
thought
undisputed
reign
of
a
region
would
fulfill
him,
but
instead,
he
grew
restless.
No
beasts
in
his
domain
proved
challenging
prey,
and
without
formidable
adversaries
to
push
his
limits,
Rengar's
spirit
waned.
He
feared
that
no
worthwhile
game
remained,
that
he
would
never
again
feel
the
thrill
of
the
hunt.
Just
when
things
seemed
their
bleakest,
he
encountered
the
monster
.
It
was
a
disturbing,
alien
thing,
distinctly
out
of
place
in
his
world
.
It
bore
huge
scything
claws
and
devoured
any
animal
that
strayed
across
its
path.
Overzealous
at
the
prospect
of
a
challenge,
Rengar
ambushed
the
monster
in
haste.
It
far
outclassed
anything
he'd
hunted
before.
Their
fight
was
savage,
and
each
suffered
crippling
wounds.
Rengar
lost
an
eye,
but
the
most
grievous
blow
was
to
his
pride.
He
had
never
before
failed
to
make
the
kill.
Worse
yet,
the
severity
of
his
injuries
forced
him
to
retreat.
Over
the
following
days,
he
hovered
on
the
threshold
between
life
and
death.
He
was
wracked
with
pain,
but
beneath
it,
he
felt
a
glimmer
of
joy.
The
hunt
was
on.
If
such
powerful
beings
existed
in
the
world,
he
would
find
them,
and
stack
their
heads
high.
The
monster,
however,
was
a
kill
he
wanted
to
savor.
On
his
den's
largest
wall,
he
reserves
a
space
for
the
beast's
head,
a
trophy
he
swears
will
one
day
be
the
centerpiece
of
his
collection.
"Prey
on
the
weak
and
you
will
survive,
prey
on
the
strong
and
you
will
live."

Sneak
Peek
Announcement
made
by
NeeksNaman
:
[1]
Rengar
sneak
peek.
Your
enemy's
heart
beats
nervously,
pumping
faster
as
you
approach.
The
time
is
right
for
the
perfect
strike,
that
split-second
when
your
victim
thinks
no
one
has
followed.
Whether
you
meet
Rengar
face-to-face
on
the
battlefield
or
back-to-blade
during
the
hunt,
you're
never
alone
and
never
safe
when
the
Pridestalker's
chosen
you
as
his
trophy.
Rengar,
the
Pridestalker,
Revealed!
Announcement
made
by
NeeksNaman
:
[2]
The
ultimate
predator‘s
many
things:
methodical,
determined,
and
unrelenting.
Meet
Rengar,
the
Pridestalker,
one
of
the
most-feared
hunters
in
all
of
Valoran,
whether
he’s
slashing
his
way
through
foes
or
leaping
from
the
shadows
of
the
brush
to
take
enemies
by
surprise.
Rengar’s
monstrous,
most-sought
prize,
however,
remains
at
large,
missing
from
the
Pridestalker’s
impressive
trophy
wall.
Unseen
Predator
(Passive):
While
in
brush
or
stealth,
Rengar
will
leap
at
the
target
when
using
his
basic
attack.
Rengar
builds
1
Ferocity
with
each
ability
he
uses
on
enemies.
When
reaching
5
Ferocity,
Rengar's
next
ability
becomes
empowered,
granting
it
a
bonus
effect.
Savagery:
Rengar's
next
basic
attack
deals
bonus
damage
and
grants
him
increased
Attack
Speed
for
a
short
duration.
Ferocity
Bonus:
Rengar
deals
enhanced
damage
and
his
Attack
Speed
bonus
increases.
Battle
Roar:
Rengar
lets
out
a
battle
roar,
damaging
enemies
and
gaining
bonus
Armor
and
Magic
Resist
for
a
short
duration.
Ferocity
Bonus:
Rengar
heals
himself
for
a
large
amount.
Bola
Strike:
Rengar
throws
a
bola
at
his
target,
slowing
them
for
a
short
duration.
Ferocity
Bonus:
Rengar
roots
the
target.
Thrill
of
the
Hunt
(Ultimate):
Rengar
activates
his
predatory
instincts,
stealthing
and
revealing
all
enemy
champions
in
a
large
radius
around
him.
He
gains
Movement
Speed
and
rapidly
generates
Ferocity
while
stealthed.
As
a
top-laner
or
jungler,
Rengar’s
brutal
strikes
and
roars
tear
through
his
enemies.
When
you
use
any
of
his
abilities
on
an
enemy,
you
generate
a
point
of
Ferocity.
Once
you’ve
stored
five
Ferocity
points,
Rengar’s
skills
become
available
instantly
and
the
next
skill
activated
gains
a
powerful
new
secondary
effect.
Players
will
have
to
strategically
manage
their
Ferocity,
activating
the
appropriate
ability
for
each
precarious
situation.
Rengar’s
passive
also
grants
his
auto
attack
a
leap
when
used
from
the
brush
or
while
invisible,
giving
this
apex
predator
immense
ganking
potential
from
hiding.
Rengar’s
ultimate
ability,
Thrill
of
the
Hunt,
grants
him
invisibility,
extra
movement
speed
and
Ferocity
points.
The
true
power
behind
Rengar’s
ultimate
is
his
visibility
of
enemies
under
the
fog
of
war.
Rengar
enters
an
all-consuming
hunting
mode,
allowing
him
to
see
enemy
locations
and
their
hearts
beating
faster
and
louder
as
he
closes
in.
No
hunter
would
be
whole
without
his
trophies
and
Rengar
is
no
stranger
to
collecting
the
prized
remains
of
his
downed
prey.
Playing
as
Rengar
grants
optional
access
to
the
Bonetooth
Necklace,
a
unique
store
item
that
collects
trophies
as
he
racks
up
kills
and
assists.
Slaying
enemies
will
increase
the
power
of
the
necklace
and
new
bonuses
unlock
when
trophy
thresholds
are
met.
You’re
never
forced
to
purchase
or
use
the
Bonetooth
Necklace,
but
are
rewarded
for
an
aggressive
playstyle
if
you
choose
to
use
it.

Inside
Design:
Rengar's
Mechanics
Announcement
made
by
RiotGenzer
:
[3]
The
Fields
of
Justice
have
never
been
more
dangerous
than
when
Rengar,
the
Pridestalker,
prepares
for
the
hunt.
With
a
new
resource
system,
an
optional
item
in
the
shop,
and
a
dynamic
passive
that
interacts
when
he’s
stealthed
or
in
the
brush,
Rengar's
bringing
many
new
mechanics
to
strike
down
his
prey.
To
learn
more
about
these
new
mechanics,
we
went
straight
to
the
source
and
talked
to
Trevor
"Classick"
Romleski
about
Rengar's
kit.

The
Creation
of
Rengar:
Art
and
Style
Announcement
made
by
RiotGenzer
:
[4]
In
order
to
bring
a
ruthless
hunter
like
Rengar
to
life,
the
designers
had
to
fuse
every
aspect
of
champion
design
into
a
predatory
experience
that
feels
as
ferocious
as
the
champion
himself.
Getting
players
inside
Rengar's
head
for
the
primal
hunt
was
the
biggest
challenge
in
his
creation.
What
began
as
a
tricky
proposition
eventually
became
a
compelling
champion
with
an
ultimate
ability
that
sums
up
the
brutal
and
methodical
Rengar
playstyle.
