Trivia
Erik
Braa
League
of
Legends
Jax
and
Draven
(01:00)
Erik
Braa
as
Jax
Jax
was
designed
by
Ezreal
.
Jax
is
voiced
by
Erik
Braa
,
who
also
voices
Draven
and
Vel'Koz
.
Jax's
name
may
derive
from
the
Greek
warrior
Ajax
.
The
name
may
have
also
derived
from
Garet
Jax
,
the
legendary
undefeatable
weapons
master
in
Terry
Brook's
Shannara
book
series.
Jax's
background
does
not
reveal
where
he
came
from
before
he
joined
the
League
.
Jax's
outward
appearance
resembles
the
look
of
the
"
Garo
",
a
ninja-like
tribe
in
"The
Legend
of
Zelda:
Majora's
Mask".
In
Jax's
game
information
page
on
the
beta
version
of
leagueoflegends.com,
his
background
image
is
an
altered
version
of
his
classic
artwork
-
altered
to
include
a
horned,
shadowy
figure.
The
shadow
resembles
Aatrox
,
although
with
enough
differences
that
it
could
be
another
of
the
five
darkin.
Riot
has
never
spoken
publically
about
this
change
or
what
it
entails.
Skins
Vandal
Jax
does
not
appear
to
be
related
to
the
gang
that
has
surfaced
among
the
other
champions
with
the
vandal
skins
such
as
Twitch
,
Brand
,
Vladimir
and
Gragas
.
This
is
further
supported
by
its
release
date,
which
preceded
the
other
Vandal
skins
by
a
significant
amount.
Vandal
Jax
may
be
a
reference
to
Paragon
Ash
from
PlayStation
video
game
"Vandal
Hearts"
as
the
colour
matches
almost
perfectly.
An
image
of
Paragon
Ash
can
be
seen
here
.
Jaximus
is
a
reference
to
the
Murmillo
,
a
gladiator
class
from
the
Roman
Imperial
Age.
It
might
also
be
a
reference
to
Maximus,
the
protagonist
of
the
movie
'Gladiator',
although
Maximus
wields
a
sword,
rather
than
a
polearm.
This
skin
features
a
memorial
tribute
to
Joe,
a
Ewings
Sarcoma
patient
who
visited
Riot
thanks
to
the
Make
A
Wish
Foundation.
Joe
passed
away
on
June
5,
2012.
[1]
The
movement
quote
for
the
Jaximus
skin,
Joe's
favorite,
was
changed
to
"Here's
to
you,
kid!"
in
his
memory.
PAX
Jax
is
a
reference
to
the
Cardboard
Tube
Samurai
from
the
web
comic
Penny
Arcade
(which
hosts
the
Penny
Arcade
Expo
-
PAX).
A
symbol
on
the
skin
resembles
Pac-Man
and
matches
symbols
on
the
Samurai's
gi
and
the
shirt
of
Penny
Arcade
protagonist
Gabe.
The
Mighty
Jax
is
a
reference
to
90's
Disney
Film
The
Mighty
Ducks
.
Most
of
Jax's
special
weapons
are
in
a
skin.
The
Lamppost
(Original),
Fishing
rod
(Angler
Jax)
and
Cardboard
tube
(PAX
Jax),
are
all
in
skins.
This
leaves
the
spatula
and
chicken
foot
as
unused.
Relations
Jax
is
Gragas
'
drinking
buddy.
Jax
was
placed
into
the
League
by
High
Councilor
Reginald
Ashram,
the
former
leader
of
the
League.
Ashram
went
missing
shortly
before
Jax's
arrival.
In
the
beta
website
,
Jax
is
listed
as
an
Ionian
champion.
Fiora
is
also
listed
as
his
rival.
