A
summoner
icon
is
an
avatar
picture
that
represents
you
in
your
friends'
friend
list,
in
chat
rooms,
in
custom
games
and
in
arranged
teams.
There
are
currently
29
starter

and
5

More

will
eventually
be
able
to
be
earned
through

hopefully
through

sometime

The

had
to
have
a

had
to
have

rating
at

Season
2
reward
icons
were
distributed
along
with
season

reward
icons
at
the
end
of
season

They
were
based
on
the
highest
rating
a
summoner
earned
during
2
month
window
near
the
end
of
season
2.
This
window
ranged
from
September
12,
2012
until
November
6,
2012.
The
icons
were
determined
based
on
both
the
rating
(tier)
achieved
and
the
queue
in
which
the
rating
was
achieved.
Having
a
higher
tier
rating
would
automatically
unlock
the
lower
tier
icons
as
well.
The
required
ratings
can
be
found
here:
http://competitive.na.leagueoflegends.com/season-two-rating-tiers
.
There
are
5
different
tiers
that
could
be
achieved:
bronze,
silver,
gold,
platinum
and
diamond.
Each
tier
is
represented
by
the
colour
of
the
chalice
on
the
icon.
Summoners
could
get
icons
for
3vs3
team
queue,
solo
5vs5
queue
and
5vs5
team
queue.
Each
queue
is
represented
by
a
gem
on
a
certain
part
of
the
chalices.
Gems
around
the
top
of
the
chalice
represent
3vs3
queue.
A
gem
in
the
middle
represents
solo
queue
and
gems
around
the
base
represent
5vs5
queue.
When
a
summoner
has
the
requirements
for
all
the
queues
in
a
certain
tier,
he
or
she
would
receive
a
bonus
icon,
that
would
combine
all
three
gem
ornaments
into
one
icon.

These
three
summoner
icons
were

available
to

during
the

Each
icon
symbolizes
a
tribe
of
the
three
Freljord
Princesses:
Ashe
,
Sejuani
,
and
Lissandra
.
Even
though
there
are
three,
a
summoner
is
only
able
to
unlock
one
of
them
to
declare
their
allegiance
to
a
tribe.

to
first
set
their
profile
icon
to
the
temporary
version
of
the
icon
they
wanted,
which
was
available
for
selection
immediately.
The
summoner
would
have
had
to
win
ten
games
against
real
players
without
changing
the
icon.
Victories
in
bot
and
custom
games

however,
did

Choose
Your
Path
During
the
2014
Lunar
Revel
Event,
Summoners
of
each
region
were
able
to
vote
for
one
of
three
different
warrior
paths.
Each
path
was
represented
by
a
unique
summoner
icon.
The
icon
of
the
warrior
path
that
accumulated
the
most
votes
in
each
region
was
given
out
to
its
summoners
while
the
other
two
were
put
on
sale
of
limited
time.
The
icon
that
was
a
region's
choice
has
a
horse
maker
on
it,
showing
that
its
path
was
the
winner.
