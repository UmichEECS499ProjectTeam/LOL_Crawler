Trivia
Adam
Harrington
in
League
of
Legends
(00:38)
Adam
Harrington
as
Karthus
Karthus
is
one
of
five
champions
voiced
by
Adam
Harrington,
the
other
four
being
Kassadin
,
Mordekaiser
,
Ryze
,
and
Shaco
.
Karthus'
ultimate,
Requiem
,
has
the
same
name
as
the
Catholic
gathering
called
the
"Requiem
Mass",
which
is
dedicated
to
praying
for
the
souls
of
the
deceased.
The
old
icon
for
Karthus'
passive,
Death
Defied
was
a
sheep.
Karthus
is
one
of
the
four
champions
to
have
abilities
which
allow
them
to
continue
to
attack
after
death.
Karthus's
ability
being
Death
Defied
and
the
others
being
Kog'Maw's
Icathian
Surprise
,
Yorick's
Omen
of
Death
and
Zyra's
Rise
of
the
Thorns
.
There
is
a
glass
case
which
has
"Press
R
to
Win""
in
all
caps
in
the
video
of
the
Mac
Version
Launch
which
possibly
references
people
playing
as
Karthus
stating
Press
R
to
Win.
Karthus
is
possibly
inspired
by
the
Four
Horsemen
of
the
Apocalypse
,
particularly
the
rider
symbolizing
Famine.
(The
other
horsemen
theme
champions
to
have
been
released
so
far
are,
Thresh
,
Morderkaiser
,
and
Hecarim
.)
Quotes
Karthus
shares
the
quote
with
Evelynn
:
"
Their
pain
is
my
pleasure"
.
Karthus
quote
"
I
will
put
you...In
my
book.
"
may
be
a
reference
to
the
anime
Death
Note
.
Skins
In
Karthus'
Chinese
splash
artworks,
he
does
not
have
a
skull
face.
This
is
likely
because
the
use
of
exposed
bones
in
video-games
is
explicitly
forbidden
in
China
(a
famous
example
is
the
race
Undead
in
World
of
Warcraft
,
where
in
the
American
server
their
bones
are
exposed,
while
in
the
Chinese
server
they're
covered).
[1]
The
Statue
of
Karthus
is
a
reference
to
the
Statue
of
Liberty
in
New
York
City
.
Grim
Reaper
Karthus
has
the
scythe
that
Death
is
usually
depicted
to
be
wielding
rather
than
his
usual
staff.
The
book
he
is
holding
in
Grim
Reaper
skin
it
is
known
as
the
"Necronomicon"
a
fictional
book
of
the
dead,
attributed
to
the
works
of
H.P.
Lovecraft.
Phantom
Karthus
is
most
likely
a
reference
to
the
Phantom
of
the
Opera,
due
to
the
mask
on
the
left
side
of
his
face.
Pentakill
Karthus
seems
to
have
a
drinking
problem,
as
seen
here.
In
the
classic
skin's
splash
artwork
and
model,
Karthus
is
holding
a
book
with
the
League
of
Legends
icon
on
it's
cover,
only
with
a
few
alterations.
Relations
Karthus
originally
was
a
self-appointed
Over-lord
of
Howling
Marsh
before
his
lore
changed
into
being
working
for
Shadow
Isles
.
Karthus
is
the
fourth
member
of
the
famous
Pentakill
band
with
Mordekaiser
,
Sona
,
Yorick
and
Olaf
.
Karthus
takes
the
role
of
Lead
Singer
as
Pentakill
Karthus,
"the
Deathsinger".
Karthus
was
present
in
a
fight
between
Malzahar
and
Kassadin
.
He
was
found
"dead"
at
the
scene,
but
he
was
revived
since
then.
He
stated
that
he
was
"protecting
the
inhibitor,"
referring
to
something
other
than
the
inhibitors
on
the
Fields
of
Justice
.
