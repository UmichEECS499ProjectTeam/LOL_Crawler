Functionality
PVP.net
is
a
platform
for
League
of
Legends
to
launch
from.
It
allows
you
to
add
friends,
check
the
League
of
Legends
store,
and
join
chat
rooms.
PVP.net
can
be
considered
a
separate
entity
from
the
actual
game
but
the
two
are
linked
and
cannot
be
used
separately.
Adobe
AIR
PVP.net
uses
a
"runtime
environment"
called
Adobe
AIR.
It
is
however
directly
built
in
the
client,
and
does
not
require
any
download/installation
from
you.
Season
1
Redesign
The
interface
received
an
upgrade
when

skin
selection,
a
new
profile
page
with
more
stats,
Draft
Mode
compatibility,
and
a
new
look
in
general.
