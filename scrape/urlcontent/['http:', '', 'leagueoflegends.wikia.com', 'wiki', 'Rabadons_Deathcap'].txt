Deathcap
is
an
advanced
item
in
League
of
Legends
[1]
.
It
is
a
powerful
item
for
pure
ability
power
casters,
and
is
also
very
effective
on
burst
assassins
and
hybrid
champions
that
take
advantage
of
Lich
Bane
for
additional
burst.

Rabadon's
Deathcap
is
essential
for
any
champion
with
ablility
power
ratios,
tanky
or
carry,
wishing
to
deal
significant
magic
damage
that
will
carry
into
late
game.

stacks
multiplicatively
with
Archmage

contentiously
stacking
on
top
of
each
other
until

too
small
to
be

Trivia
This
item
resulted
from
a
separation
of
the
offensive
and
defensive
abilities
of
Zhonya's
Ring
.
This
is
the
offensive
item,
while
Zhonya's
Hourglass
is
its
defensive
counterpart.
It
was
originally
named
Banksy's
Deathcap
in
the
Patch
Day
Preview.
This
is
a
tribute
to
one
of
Riot's
employees
named
Banksy
(David
Banks,
Director
of
Platform
Engineering).
The
image
artwork
would
seem
to
be
based
off
of
the
Sorting
Hat
from
the
Harry
Potter
franchise.
There
are
eyes
and
a
mouth-like
band
visible
on
the
hat,
very
similar
to
the
Sorting
Hat.
Not
counting
other
ability
power
items
,
runes
,
and
masteries
Rabadon's
Deathcap
gives
156
ability
power
alone.
The
upgrade
from
its
parts
grants
36
AP.
While
it
has
the
potential
to
be
the
single
highest
source
of
ability
power
in
the
game,
Rabadon's
Deathcap
is
rarely
purchased
first,
as
its
passive
ability
requires
other
ability
power
items
to
be
fully
effective,
to
the
point
of
the
item
being
barely
cost
effective,
which
the
large
majority
of
expensive
items
are
by
a
large
margin.
It
is
also
somewhat
difficult
to
build
early
in
the
game
as
one
of
its
components
is
quite
expensive,
making
it
difficult
to
purchase
without
kills
or
other
gold
income.
