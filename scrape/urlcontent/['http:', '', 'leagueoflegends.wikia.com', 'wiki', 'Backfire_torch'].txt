Trivia
This
item
used
to
be
similar
to
Liandry's
Torment
,
which
was
not
available
in
Twisted
Treeline
and
Crystal
Scar
at
the
time.
Blackfire
was
revamped
in
patch
V3.10
;
it
is
now
a
sort
of
'smaller'
version
of
Deathfire
Grasp
,
which
is
no
longer
available
on
TT
and
CS.
Blackfire
is
450g
cheaper
than
Deathfire,
with
toned-down
stats
to
compensate,
including
a
damage
over
time
effect
instead
of
a
nuke.
