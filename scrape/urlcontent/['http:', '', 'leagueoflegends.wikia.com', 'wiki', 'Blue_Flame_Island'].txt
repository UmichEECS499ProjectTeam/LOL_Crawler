Blue
Flame
Island
are
three
small
land
masses
off
the
southeastern
coast
of
the
Valoran
mainland.
Lore
The
culture
of
Blue
Flame
Island
is
deeply
tied
to
Bilgewater
,
the
island's
major
sea
port
and
city-state.
Bilgewater,
over
the
years,
has
become
an
important
stop
for
trade
ships
traveling
near
the
Blue
Flame
Island.
While
this
increased
the
nation's
wealth
and
influence
on
Valoran,
the
trade
routes
also
brought
piracy,
and
the
island's
inhabitants
found
themselves
caught
in
a
frenzy
of
pillaging.
Things
have
relatively
settled
down
since
those
days.
Many
inhabitants
now
strive
to
unite
under
Bilgewater
in
order
to
make
themselves
into
a
strong
and
independent
society.
