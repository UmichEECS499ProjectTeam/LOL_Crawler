Ability
Details
Ravenous
Flock
is
a
toggled
ability
with
a
persistent
point
blank
auto-targeted
component
when
active.
Applies
spell
effects
as
an
area
of
effect
ability.
Spell
vamp
is
reduced
to
one-third
effectiveness.
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
will
apply
a
15%

Spell
shields
will

Additional
Information:
Ravenous
Flock
has
no
cast
time
and
does
not
interrupt
Swain's
previous
orders.
Ravenous
Flock
is
not
a
channeled
ability.
As
such,
crowd
control
will
not
stop
its
effects
and
will
persist
throughout
the
untargetability
of
Zhonya's
Hourglass
.
Although
the
projected
ravens
appear
to
return
to
Swain
after
striking
a
unit,
this
is
purely
visual
and
does
not
affect
his
healing
in
any
way.
