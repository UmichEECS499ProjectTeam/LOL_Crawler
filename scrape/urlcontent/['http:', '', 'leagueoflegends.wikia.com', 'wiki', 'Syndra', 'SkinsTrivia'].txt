Trivia
Syndra
was
designed
by
Meddler.
[1]
Syndra
was
originally
named
"Sym"
[2]
.
Syndra
shares
the
voice
actress
of
Evelynn
,
however,
the
voice
actress
has
never
been
publically
revealed
or
credited
and
is
anonymous.
Syndra
is
the
first
official
champion
to
directly
manipulate
minions
and
neutral
monsters
to
deal
damage
to
other
champions,
moving
them
around
with
her
abilities.
Syndra's
spheres
appear
as
red
instead
of
blue
when
on
the
opposing
team.
She
is
the
fourth
champion
to
have
team
perspective
based
particles,
with
the
third
being
Draven
,
the
second
being
Cassiopeia
and
the
first
being
Singed
.
Using
Syndra's
Force
of
Will
to
hit
an
enemy
unit
with
the
Lizard
Elder
will
apply
the
debuff
on
them.
Also,
if
Syndra
throws
the
Ancient
Golem
,
she
will
be
refunded
10
mana
and
the
ability's
cooldown
will
be
lowered
by
1
second.
Syndra
is
the
second
of
the
three
dark
themed
Ionian
Champion,
the
other
two
being
Varus
and
Zed
.
She
shares
a
light
themed
skin
with
Varus
and
Aatrox
.
Syndra's
dance
is
based
on
the
choreography
for
the
song
Hoot
by
Girls'
Generation
(소녀시대:
So
Nyeo
Shi
Dae),
a
popular
Korean
girl
group.
A
side-by-side
comparison
video
can
be
seen
here
.
Syndra
is
the
third
champion
to
currently
have
a
difficulty
rating
of
100,
the
first
being
Cassiopeia
,
the
second
being
Orianna
,
and
the
fourth
being
Draven
.
On
release,
her
difficulty
rating
was
originally
90.
Each
of
Syndra's
abilities
gain
new
graphical
details
when
levelled
to
max
rank.
Dark
Sphere
gains
a
darker
shockwave
color
(red
for
Classic
skin,
orange-gold
for
Justicar)
and
cracks
the
earth;
Force
of
Will
gains
a
similarily-colored,
larger
shockwave
as
well
as
an
energy
trail
following
thrown
spheres;
Scatter
the
weak
gains
a
similarily-colored
energy
wave
and
electrical
jolts;
when
attaining
the
max
rank
of
Unleashed
Power,
the
three
orbs
floating
around
Syndra
will
have
a
slight
change
of
appearance
and
will
leave
a
trail.
Syndra
is
the
second
champion
speculated
to
be
omnipotent
,
or
nearly
so.
The
first
one
was
Xerath.
However,
much
like
Xerath
himself,
she
is
still
severely
limited
As
seen
in
this
video
,
Syndra
appears
to
be
able
to
use
the
balls
from
another
Syndra.
Skins
Syndra's
name
and
appearance
shares
some
similarities
with
Sindel
from
the
Mortal
Kombat
franchise.
On
Syndra's
classic
skin,
her
helm
is
similar
to
Midna's
from
The
Legend
of
Zelda:
Twilight
Princess
series.
In
addition,
it
also
looks
like
the
"Mantle
of
Decorum",
Ionia's
highest
decoration.
However,
it
is
placed
on
her
forehead
instead
of
floating
behind
her
head,
as
a
sort
of
symbol
of
power,
much
like
a
crown.
In
her
earlier
designs,
she
was
intended
to
have
a
Mantle
of
Decorum;
however,
this
was
most
likely
removed
because
it
contradicts
with
established
lore:
the
Mantles
of
Decorum
are
reserved
only
for
Ionia's
most
revered
and
respected
people.
Justicar
Syndra
is
possibly
a
version
of
Syndra
from
an
alternate
history,
where
she
instead
embraced
her
elders'
teaching
and
became
a
force
for
good.
This
theory
is
based
on
her
warmer
color
scheme,
use
of
white
feathers
and
golden
spheres.
Her
helmet
also
resembles
the
sun,
a
symbol
of
divinity,
and
her
spheres
contain
images
that
resemble
a
"Mantle
of
Decorum".
She
shares
the
Justicar
skin
with
Aatrox
.
The
word
"Justicar"
also
means
"man
of
justice"
i.e.
a
judge.
It
is
also
the
first
light
themed
skin
for
a
dark
themed
champion.
The
second
being
Arclight
Varus
,
and
the
third
being
Justicar
Aatrox
Quotes
Syndra
is
the
second
champion
to
have
quotes
when
she
levels
up
an
ability,
the
first
being
Vayne
upon
leveling
Silver
Bolts
.
Syndra
shares
a
quote
with
Karma
:
"By
force
of
will"
.
Syndra's
joke
is
a
triple
entendre
.
The
primary
play
on
words
is
regarding
her
lore
where
she
was
deemed
mentally
unbalanced
by
her
Ionian
elders
(as
balance
is
a
defining
virtue
in
Ionian
culture),
and
stands
upon
on
her
dark
spheres
to
prove
that
she
"has
balance."
It
also
refers
to
Syndra's
champion
balance
as
she
was
reportedly
overpowered
during
development.
