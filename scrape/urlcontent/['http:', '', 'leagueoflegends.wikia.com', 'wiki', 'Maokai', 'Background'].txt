Zyra
Maokai
was
once
a
peaceful
nature
spirit
dwelling
in
an
idyllic
forest,
but
the
arrogance
of
humans
brought
an
end
to
that
life.
Now
he
is
a
gnarled
shadow
of
his
former
self,
twisted
by
dark
magics
that
defied
the
natural
order
of
life
and
death.
Infused
with
power
he
never
asked
for,
the
mighty
treant
has
become
a
vengeful
force
of
nature,
sundering
his
enemies
with
wild
magic
and
iron-hard
limbs
as
he
searches
Valoran
for
the
means
to
restore
the
Shadow
Isles
to
its
former
glory.
Before
the
Shadow
Isles
became
a
land
of
death,
the
islands
teemed
with
natural
life
and
beauty.
This
was
never
truer
than
in
the
isles'
sacred
forest:
a
paradise
of
thriving
trees
and
countless
species,
both
animal
and
spirit
alike.
When
the
king
of
the
Shadow
Isles
ordered
his
sorcerers
to
crack
open
the
barrier
separating
life
and
death,
the
forest
served
as
a
well
of
power
the
magi
drank
deeply
from.
The
sorcerers'
ritual
succeeded
in
corrupting
the
cycle
of
life
and
unleashing
forces
they
could
not
hope
to
contain.
Vitality
seeped
from
every
living
thing
in
the
Shadow
Isles:
great
trees
withered
into
gnarled
husks,
people
warped
into
twisted
shades,
and
forest
spirits
became
hollow
wisps.
Maokai,
the
strongest
spirit
of
the
sacred
forest,
watched
in
horror
as
his
world
crumbled
and
died
around
him.
He
fought
to
mend
the
wound
in
the
world,
but
could
not
halt
the
destruction
wrought
by
the
human
folly.
As
the
ghastly
energies
sought
to
overwhelm
the
great
spirit,
he
made
one
last
desperate
attempt
to
preserve
the
life
of
the
land.
Maokai
inhabited
the
ancient
oak
at
the
heart
of
the
forest's
spiritual
power.
There
he
gathered
the
essence
of
the
isles
into
the
tree
as
the
corruption
of
undeath
clawed
hungrily
at
anything
within
reach.
Fortified
by
boundless
magic,
Maokai
could
not
be
consumed
entirely,
though
the
spirit
was
not
left
unscathed.
Maokai,
now
saturated
with
the
essences
of
life
and
death,
became
fused
with
the
ancient
oak
and
contorted
into
an
abomination.
For
ages,
pain
and
grief
were
the
only
companions
the
spirit
had.
His
boughs
grew
heavy
as
he
wept
at
the
desolation
of
everything
he
had
known
and
loved,
and
his
roots
tore
from
the
earth
as
he
raged
at
the
reckless
sorcerers
that
had
ruined
his
home.
But
all
was
not
lost.
Maokai
had
preserved
the
last
vital
spark
remaining
in
the
Shadow
Isles,
and
with
it,
the
hope
of
returning
life
to
the
land.
Like
moths
to
a
flame,
the
tormented
shades
of
the
Shadow
Isles
were
drawn
to
the
living
essence
within
Maokai.
The
spirit
guarded
the
seed
of
life
from
the
relentless
undead,
but
Maokai
knew
he
could
not
fend
them
off
forever.
He
needed
to
escape
the
land
of
death
his
home
had
become,
so
he
cast
himself
into
the
sea
and
trusted
in
nature
to
guide
him
towards
a
living
land.
There
he
hoped
to
find
the
means
to
cast
out
the
forces
of
undeath
and
restore
life
to
the
Shadow
Isles.
“To
defy
the
natural
order
has
consequences.”
―
Maokai
The
twisting
magical
energies
unleashed
by
mages
during
the
Rune
Wars
caused
an
incredible
amount
of
devastation
to
the
natural
world.
The
League
was
established
to
control
the
use
of
this
magic
by
confining
it
to
the
Fields
of
Justice
.
By
limiting
its
use
to
there,
they
thought
that
they
could
prevent
it
from
doing
further
harm
to
the
environment.
It
seemed
that
they
were
successful
until
Maokai
came
into
being.
During
a
League
match
on
the
Twisted
Treeline
,
Maokai,
an
ancient
oak
that
stood
above
the
upper
jungle,
spontaneously
roared
to
life.
Ripped
from
the
natural
balance
by
arcane
forces,
his
sentience
was
forged
in
chaos.
Before
the
Adjudicators
of
the
League
could
step
in
and
suppress
him,
he
slew
all
six
champions
participating
in
the
match.
The
scholars
of
the
Arcanum
Majoris
took
a
keen
interest
in
him,
as
they
were
eager
to
discover
the
secrets
of
his
animation.
Maokai
was
furious,
however.
He
abhorred
the
existence
that
was
thrust
upon
him;
he
felt
it
was
a
corruption
of
nature.
He
learned
to
communicate
with
people
in
hopes
of
finding
a
way
to
be
returned
to
his
former,
true
state.
Seizing
the
opportunity,
the
League
offered
a
trade.
They
would
research
a
way
to
revert
him
so
long
as
he
agreed
to
fight
in
the
League
of
Legends.
Maokai
was
indifferent
to
verdicts
rendered
by
the
League,
but
he
was
eager
to
punish
summoners
for
their
wanton
use
of
magic.
He
agreed
to
the
terms
under
one
condition:
once
they
learned
how
to
turn
him
back,
they
would
never
animate
another
tree
again.
He
wears
a
lantern
on
the
Fields
of
Justice
to
set
him
apart
from
the
other
trees,
and
as
a
warning
to
the
“animals”
that
would
do
him
harm.
“I
will
use
this
power
until
I
am
free
of
it.”

OBSERVATION
A
frenzy
erupts
on
the
Twisted
Treeline.
Saplings
scurry
in
every
direction,
detonating
in
multicolored
explosions
of
arcane
energy.
League
Champions
and
summoners
alike
rush
onto
the
field
to
contain
an
uprooted
tree
that
is
not
only
moving,
but
also
attacking
everything
in
sight.
The
tree
is
visibly
confused
over
his
violent
birth
into
awareness,
and
he
involuntarily
conjures
an
arcane
storm
of
magic.
The
storm
grows
as
it
absorbs
energy
from
the
magical
and
physical
attacks
being
directed
at
the
verdant
force,
until
suddenly
the
torrent
explodes
with
enough
power
to
kill
everyone
present.
A
bright
orange
light
falls
over
the
scene
as
Kayle
appears,
shielding
the
group
from
death.
As
the
dust
clears,
the
tree
is
contained
in
an
earthen
dome
by
League
representatives,
and
immediately
whisked
away
to
the
Institute
of
War
for
further
examination.
REFLECTION
The
room
Maokai
found
himself
in
was
cavernous,
with
a
reflecting
pool
stretching
across
the
entire
expanse
of
the
floor.
A
human
adorned
in
flowing
purple
robes
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room,
reflections
of
light
from
the
pool
dancing
across
her.
“An
honor
to
make
your
acquaintance.”
The
woman
bowed
deeply,
admiration
glowing
in
her
eyes
as
she
beheld
the
treant.
“I
shall
be
administering
your
judgment
for
entry
into
the
League.”
Maokai
exploded
into
a
rage.
"Judgment?
You
humans
woke
me,
and
created
this
abomination
of
life,
and
now
you
stand
and
judge
me?"
The
summoner
did
not
respond.
She
raised
her
arms
and
muttered
an
incantation
under
her
breath.
The
floor
swam
beneath
him,
and
suddenly
the
room
dissolved
away.
His
roots
tingled
with
familiarity
as
he
found
himself
standing
in
a
large
expanse
of
trees.
The
forest
around
him
stood
tall,
with
strong
trunks
and
leaves
of
every
color
-
this
was
his
home
as
it
had
existed
eons
ago.
He
ached
for
what
was
long
passed.
Suddenly,
the
surrounding
terrain
exploded.
The
ground
surrounding
Maokai
sunk
and
bubbled
in
grotesque
ways.
Vegetation
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
began
to
melt
with
a
sickening
hissing
sound.
Humans
were
running
panicked
through
the
forest
under
a
rain
of
bullets
and
chemicals.
A
boy
fell
to
the
ground,
struck
by
a
stray
bullet.
The
summoner
and
Maokai
were
invisible
to
the
chaos
erupting
around
them,
but
somehow
the
boy
looked
straight
at
them,
the
life
in
his
bright
eyes
quickly
fading.
The
ground
below
Maokai
changed
again,
accelerating
until
it
became
a
blur.
Maokai
stood,
trembling,
as
the
scenery
assaulted
all
his
new
found
senses.
The
acrid
odor
of
trees
melting
in
a
pool
of
acid.
A
beautiful
island
the
color
of
the
sky
splitting
asunder
into
three.
A
beautiful,
ancient
city
of
white
quartz
twisting
into
itself
in
impossible
ways,
defying
the
laws
of
time
and
space.
Maokai
closed
his
eyes,
weary.
The
League
must
have
assumed
they
were
showing
him
something
new,
but
it
was
nothing
he
hadn’t
already
known.
He
had
stood
for
centuries,
absorbing
the
pain
and
sorrow
from
the
abuses
wrought
upon
the
land
and
the
life
in
its
soil.
The
summoner
spoke
quietly,
holding
the
scene
that
flashed
before
them
in
reverence.
“We
do
not
ask
for
any
of
this,
yet
it
is
brought
upon
us
by
those
who
would
do
evil.
By
joining
the
League,
you
can
help
us
prevent
these
things
from
happening.”
Maokai’s
disgust
had
not
subsided.
“You
humans
are
the
ones
who
are
causing
this.
You
ask
me
to
feel
for
you
when
all
I
see
is
the
hatred
you
bring
onto
yourselves.
When
you
see
your
children
being
overrun
with
weapons,
I
see
the
fallen
trees
carved
into
your
instruments
of
destruction.
I
see
the
land
which
has
existed
before
you
and
which
will
continue
to
exist
after
you
suffer
for
your
petty
squabbles.”
“Knowing
all
this,
would
you
still
choose
to
go
back?"
She
asked.
The
treant
hesitated,
surprising
himself.
“Or
will
you
continue
to
stand,
impassively,
believing
that
you
can
affect
none
of
this?”
Her
accusatory
tone
snapped
him
from
his
momentary
hesitation.
"Your
wars
are
no
concern
of
mine.
You
deign
to
awaken
me
to
the
pain
you
humans
suffer,
but
before
you
gave
me
this
curse
I
already
knew
your
pain
and
suffering.
When
the
earth
absorbs
the
blood
of
your
children,
it
cries.
I
have
withstood
this
longer
than
you
can
even
imagine.
We
of
the
earth
do
not
feel,
and
thus
I
am
not
of
the
conviction
to
change
how
you
humans
live
or
die."
The
summoner's
eyes
darkened.
It
was
not
the
response
the
League
wanted,
but
it
was
the
only
one
they
were
going
to
get.
“Then
what
will
you
do?”
“I
will
walk
this
path
until
you
can
turn
me
back,
as
promised.”
He
paused,
and
one
could
swear
that
something
akin
to
a
smile
twisted
the
tree’s
mouth.
“Until
then,
I
will
punish
you
magic
users
with
these
hands
you
were
kind
enough
to
bestow
upon
me.”
Composing
herself,
the
summoner
expelled
the
illusion
with
a
sweep
of
her
hands.
"Very
well.
That
is
your
answer."
She
turned
on
her
heel
and
walked
away
without
another
word.
Maokai
watched
her
go,
impassively.
He
noticed
the
young
boy's
blood
from
the
illusion
lingering
in
a
puddle
on
the
floor,
though
the
body
had
been
whisked
away.
The
treant
started
to
walk
past
it,
but
suddenly
stopped
and
turned.
With
slow,
deliberate
movements,
he
yanked
off
a
chunk
of
his
roots
and
laid
them
gingerly
in
the
pool
of
blood.
The
roots
began
to
absorb
the
blood,
slowly
at
first,
and
then
desperately,
as
if
the
blood
could
not
be
held
back.
The
roots
jumbled
together
into
a
mess
of
knots,
and
then
a
sapling
emerged.
It
looked
up
at
him
with
innocent
eyes.
Another
chance
at
life.
Something
inside
the
ancient
tree
moved,
though
what
it
was
he
had
no
idea.
He
knew
that
someday
he
would
return
to
stillness,
but
things
would
never
be
the
same.

Sneak
Peek
Sometimes,
when
you
look
at
the
League
of
Legends
champion
lineup,
it’s
easy
to
feel
like
you’ve
seen
it
all.
You’ve
seen
light
mages,
thorn
mages,
mad
scientists,
illusionists,
ninjas,
and
warriors
with
gigantic
swords.
But
there’s
something
that
this
next
champion
has
that
none
of
them
do:
roots.
That’s
right,
while
you
may
have
been
engaged
in
epic,
pitched
battles
with
trolls,
gargoyles,
ogres,
scarecrows,
minotaurs,
mummies,
and
mutant
armadillos,
I
bet
you’ve
never
had
to
fight
a
tree
before!
Introducing
Maokai,
the
Twisted
Treant;
a
groundbreaking
new
champion
in
the
League
of
Legends
whose
bark
may
or
may
not
be
worse
than
his
bite.
You
decide.

(
Original
Stats
)
Sap
Magic
(Innate)
Each
time
a
champion
near
Maokai
casts
a
spell,
he
gains
a
charge
of
Magical
Sap.
When
he
has
5
charges,
Maokai's
next
melee
attack
drains
energy
from
his
target,
healing
him
for
a
percentage
of
his
maximum
health.
Arcane
Smash
(Q)
Maokai
slams
the
ground,
the
force
of
which
knocks
nearby
enemies
back
and
sends
an
arcane
shockwave
forward,
damaging
and
slowing
his
enemies.
Twisted
Advance
(W)
Maokai
dissolves
into
a
cloud
of
arcane
energies.
He
regrows
near
a
target
enemy,
dealing
damage
and
rooting
it
in
place.
Sapling
Toss
(E)
Maokai
hurls
a
sapling,
dealing
damage
on
impact.
The
sapling
becomes
implanted
in
the
ground,
warding
a
nearby
area.
When
enemies
approach,
the
sapling
attacks,
exploding
in
an
arcane
blast
that
damages
enemies.
Vengeful
Maelstrom
(Ultimate)
Maokai
shields
his
allies
by
drawing
power
from
hostile
spells
and
attacks,
reducing
non-tower
damage
done
to
allied
champions
in
the
area.
Maokai
can
prolong
the
effect
as
long
as
he
has
mana
to
spend
on
it.
When
the
effect
ends,
Maokai
unleashes
the
absorbed
energy
to
deal
damage
to
enemies
within
the
vortex.
