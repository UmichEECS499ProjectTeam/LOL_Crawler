Redirected
from
Void
The
Void
is
a
place
between
dimensions
and
between
worlds.
Lore
To
some
it
is
known
as
the
Outside,
to
others
it
is
the
Unknown.
To
most,
however,
it
is
called
the
Void.
It
is
a
timeless
place
inhabited
by
various
seemingly
intelligent
entities
who,
for
reasons
beyond
human
understanding,
have
the
desire
to
gain
entrance
to
and
vitiate
the
worlds
outside
their
realm.
These
creatures
are
called
"Voidborn".
Some
Voidborn,
however
Summoning
rituals,
which
can
bring
champions
from
other
worlds,
have
also
been
known
to
cross
into
the
Void.
According
to
Vel'Koz
Void
is
a
very
dark
place,
both
he
and
Cho'Gath
said
that
the
daylight
in
Runeterra
is
too
strong
for
them.
The
lost
city
called
Icathia
seems
to
be
connected
to
the
void,
as
some
voidborn
are
known
to
have
appeared
in
the
place
and
some
mortals
are
known
to
have
gained
the
void's
power
in
it.
Mortals
who
encounter
the
power
of
the
Void
generally
have
one
of
a
two
reactions:
Like
Malzahar,
the
Prophet
of
the
Void
,
their
minds
may
be
overwhelmed
and
they
may
become
willing
servants
to
the
dark
apocalyptic
destinies
they
see
emanating
from
the
Abyss.
On
Runeterra,
these
individuals
are
referred
to
as
"The
Cult
of
the
Void".
Like
Kassadin,
the
Void
Walker
,
they
may
be
horrified
and
shocked
into
an
unyielding
desire
to
lay
down
their
lives
to
forestall
the
doom
they
see.
On
Runeterra,
these
individuals
are
referred
to
as
"The
Preservers".
Some
historical
evidence
show
that,
in
times
long
past,
there
were
massive
magical
projects
throughout
Runeterra
oriented
toward
creating
a
bulwark
against
the
Void.
These
projects
and
their
history,
however,
remain
apocryphal.
It
also
seems
that
all
four
creatures
emanating
from
the
Void
seem
to
have
a
hunger
that
they
must
satisfy
and
apostrophes
in
their
names;
Vel'Koz
seeks
knowledge,
Kha'Zix
seeks
to
consume
deadly
creatures,
Kog'Maw
is
hungry,
and
Cho'Gath
has
both
his
Carnivore
and
Feast
abilities.
Currently,
Malzahar
performs
rituals
with
his
followers
to
sacrifice
humans
to
the
void.
In
one
instance
Kassadin
tried
to
stop
him,
however
Malzahar
managed
to
trick
Kassadin
into
sending
his
daughter
into
the
void.
