Mana
Regeneration
(also
known
as
Mp5
)
is
a
statistic
that
determines
the
amount
of
mana
that
a
champion
regenerates
over
a
five-second
period.
Each
champion
that
uses
mana
starts
with
a
certain
base
rate
of
mana
regeneration,
which
increases
by
a
small
amount
at
each
level-up
.
It
can
be
further
increased
by
a
variety
of
items
and
effects,
as
detailed
below.
Mana
regeneration
scales
additively,
meaning
that
each
bonus
point
acquired
directly
affects
the
statistic.
This
is
true
whether
the
bonus
is
a
flat
value
or
percentage-based.

To
achieve
this,
she
must:

last

seconds.

)))
×
(1

)
=

However,
it
should
be
noted
that
these
values
will
not
be
maintained
for
longer
than
half
a
second,
since
the
%
increases
depending
on
missing
mana
will
decrease.
Taking
this
into
account,
the
highest
mana
regeneration
per
half-second
is
232.
70
in
the
Crystal
Scar,
and
159.
55
in
Summoner's
