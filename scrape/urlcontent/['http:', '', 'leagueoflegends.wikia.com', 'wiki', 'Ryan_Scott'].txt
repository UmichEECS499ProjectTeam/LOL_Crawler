Ryan
“Morello”
Scott
began
his
game
career
at
the
ground
floor
of
Microsoft
Game
Studios’
QA,
actually
delaying
the
Xbox™
release
by
catching
a
dev
kit
(and
then
the
QA
area)
on
fire,
delaying
QA
operations
until
the
hazmat
team
could
clean
out
the
toxic
residue
(Washington
state
has
strict
OSHA-like
laws).
After
his
eyebrows
grew
back,
Ryan
moved
on
to
do
QA
and
eventually
design
at
ArenaNet,
doing
content
creation
and
balance
design
on
the
original
Guild
Wars,
and
helping
create
the
framework
for
Guild
Wars
2.
An
incorrigible
Seattlite,
Ryan
brings
his
near-clinical
caffeine
addiction,
fear
of
the
sun
and
endless
awe
about
good
Mexican
food
to
the
office
--
where
he
comes
from,
Mexico
is
definitely
considered
a
foreign
country
and
exotic.
His
gaming
background
spans
mostly
competitive
multiplayer
games,
including
tournament
play
in
Guild
Wars,
Natural
Selection,
Battlefield
1942
and
Tekken
Tag
Tournament.
Special
Ability
Booming
Voice
:
Whenever
Ryan
is
involved
in
a
discussion,
his
voice
carries
through
the
room,
walls,
buildings
and
county
lines
to
ensure
everyone
everywhere
hears
him.
This
ability
deafens
nearby
allies
for
2-5
seconds.
Scales
on
blood
alcohol
content
(+10DB
per
.1%
BAC).
Designed
champions
Zyra,
Rise
of
the
Thorns
(partly
with
Coronach
and
CertainlyT
)
[1]
Trivia
The
item
Morellonomicon
is
named
after
him.
