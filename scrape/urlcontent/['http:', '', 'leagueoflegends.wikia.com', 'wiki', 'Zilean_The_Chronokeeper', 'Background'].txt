Champion
In
the
wastelands
of
Urtistan
,
there
was
once
a
great
city.
It
perished
long
ago
in
a
terrible
Rune
War,
like
most
of
the
lands
below
the
Great
Barrier.
Nevertheless,
one
man
survived:
a
sorcerer
named
Zilean.
Being
obsessed
with
time,
it
was
only
fitting
that
he
dwelled
in
the
city's
Clock
Tower.
As
the
havoc
of
the
war
neared
his
home,
Zilean
experimented
with
powerful
temporal
magic
to
divine
all
possible
futures,
hoping
to
discover
a
peaceful
solution.
But
Zilean's
enchantments
affected
his
perception
of
the
passage
of
time,
and
he
was
in
a
contemplative
stasis
when
Urtistan
was
set
upon
by
an
entire
phalanx
of
dark
summoner-knights
of
unknown
affiliation.
By
the
time
he
realized
his
error,
Urtistan
was
nothing
more
than
smoldering
debris.
The
summoners
who
were
responsible
for
its
destruction
had
wisely
left
the
Clock
Tower
unharmed,
both
to
avoid
drawing
Zilean's
attention
and
to
torment
him
for
his
oversight.
Zilean
barely
had
time
to
grieve
the
momentous
loss
before
he
learned
that
his
dangerous
research
had
a
cruel
side
effect:
chrono-displasia.
This
mystical
disease
granted
him
immortality,
but
detached
his
consciousness
from
its
anchor
in
the
present
time.
He
now
mentally
drifts
through
time,
from
any
point
he
has
already
lived
to
the
present,
unable
to
impact
the
events
which
unfold.
The
most
torturous
aspect
of
this
curse
is
that
Zilean
sometimes
experiences
Urtistan
as
it
once
was
and
the
rest
of
the
time
resides
in
its
lonely
ruins.
Only
the
powerful
summoning
magic
employed
by
members
of
the
League
of
Legends
has
been
able
to
treat
this
condition,
and
Zilean
has
joined
in
hopes
of
finding
a
cure,
and
thereafter
a
way
to
save
his
people.
"There
is
no
greater
grief
than
for
a
loss
that
is
yet
to
come."
―
Zilean
Rising
from
the
cracked,
dried
lakebeds
of
Urizan
is
a
tower,
shaped
like
a
huge
grandfather
clock.
Impenetrable
and
unassailable,
there
are
no
doors
into
it,
nor
any
openings
to
climb
or
fly
into.
There
is
no
water
or
vegetation
within
a
hundred
miles
of
this
structure,
only
the
desiccated
remains
of
what
was
once
a
beautiful
flourishing
lake,
now
destroyed
by
the
ravages
of
war
and
the
hands
of
time.
This
is
the
way
he
wants
it,
the
man
who
constructed
this
tower
out
here
in
the
middle
of
nowhere.
He
has
no
need
of
supplies.
Has
no
desire
for
visitors.
Inside,
Zilean
tinkers
with
his
clocks.
They
cover
his
workshop.
Hundreds
of
them,
maybe
thousands.
Some
work;
most
do
not.
He
is
obsessed
with
time.
For
he
is
both
blessed
and
cursed
by
it.
Blessed
because
he
has
discovered
the
way
to
manipulate
time,
making
it
move
forward
and
back
at
his
whims.
Cursed
because
each
time
he
does,
he
leaves
a
little
piece
of
himself
behind,
doomed
to
see
the
world
how
it
was,
is,
and
eventually
will
be—all
at
the
same
time.
That
is
why
he
lives
here,
in
the
middle
of
a
drained,
dead
lake.
When
he
looks
out
the
window
he
can
see
it
as
it
was,
hundreds
of
years
ago,
beautiful
and
alive.
But
at
some
point
he
must
look
away,
for
watching
it
be
destroyed
over
and
over
again
for
all
eternity
could
drive
even
the
most
solid
mind
insane.
