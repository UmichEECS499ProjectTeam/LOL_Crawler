Vision
Ward
is
a
consumable
item
in
League
of
Legends
.
[1]
Vision
wards
are
limited
to
2
per
player
inventory
as
well
as
only
one
placed
on
the
map
per
player.
Objects
revealed
Unlike
Stealth
Wards
,
Vision
Wards
allow
a
team
to
see
invisible
champions
and
objects
like:
Akali
while
inside
her
Twilight
Shroud
Evelynn
while
stealthed
with
Shadow
Walk
Rengar
while
stealthed
with
Thrill
of
the
Hunt
Shaco's
Jack
In
The
Box
Shaco
while
stealthed
from
Deceive
Talon
while
stealthed
from
Shadow
Assault
Teemo
while
stealthed
with
Camouflage
Teemo's
Noxious
Trap
Twitch
while
stealthed
with
Ambush
Vayne's
Tumble
while
stealthed
with
Final
Hour
Wukong
while
stealthed
from
Decoy
Enemy
Stealth
Wards
The
ward
from
Wriggle's
Lantern
Notes
Vision
wards
are
visible
at
all
times
and
have
5
HP.
Every
attack
done
to
it
will
only
damage
it
by
1.
There
is
also
no
way
to
regenerate
its
health
.
A
summoner
can
Teleport
his
or
her
champion
to
a
vision
ward.
Vision
Wards
are
unavailable
for
the
Twisted
Treeline
,
the
Crystal
Scar
,
and
the
Howling
Abyss
maps.
Wards
grant
30
gold
when
destroyed.
If
the
player
who
reveals
the
ward
and
the
killer
of
the
ward
are
different
players,
the
gold
will
be
split
50/50
so
each
gains
15
gold.
Strategy
If
you
are
up
against
an
enemy
team
with
at
least
one
stealth
champion
place
the
Vision
Ward
at
key
points
in
your
lane
to
prevent
being
ganked,
or
against
a
champion
such
as
Akali
who
relies
on
stealth
to
avoid
damage.
It
is
most
beneficial
to
place
a
Vision
Ward
near
high
priority
targets
which
will
probably
be
warded,
like
Baron
Nashor
or
Dragon
or
at
a
location
of
a
known
ward.
