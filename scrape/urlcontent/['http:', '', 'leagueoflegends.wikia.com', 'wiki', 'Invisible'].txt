Redirected
from
Invisible
Stealth
is
the
mechanic
by
which
some
units
become
invisible
for
a
determined
period
of
time.

Gameplay
Stealthed
units
will
fade
and/or
disappear
from
enemy
sight
until
they
attack/have
been
attacked,
or
the
duration
of
their
invisibility
effect
expires.
For
ranged
champions,
auto
attacks
must
actually
land
on
a
target
for
the
stealth
to
expire
prematurely.
For
some
champions,
using
an
ability
that
will
cause
them
to
become
stealthed
is
preceded
by
a
period
called
a
"fade
time",
during
which
the
champion
appears
partially
transparent,
but
is
still
visible
to
enemies.
During
this
fade
time,
any
damage
taken
by
the
champion
delays
becoming
invisible
for
a
short
period
of
time.
No
matter
how
many
times
a
champion
is
hit,
however,
the
fade
time
on
invisibility
cannot
exceed
five
seconds
depending
on
if
the
champion
has
base
banshee's
veil.
Summoner
spells
can
be
used
during
stealth
without
breaking
it.

them.
Nidalee's
Bushwhack
Nocturne's
Duskbringer
will
provide
semi-reveal.
Though
stealthed
unit
will
still
be
immune
to
autoattacks
and
targeted
spells,

trail
will
compromise
the
position
of
said
unit
for
5
seconds,
even

Noxian

Allied
turrets
have
a
"true
sight"
stealth
detection
range
that
will
reveal
any
stealthed
unit.
Presence
detection
without
reveal
All
abilities
that
do
not
require
single
target
to
cast
can
affect
stealthed
champions
(but
will
not
reveal
them).
Certain
abilities
can
only
be
cast
if
an
enemy
is
in
range
of
the
AoE
casting
circle
-
these
abilities
will
light
up
and
become
available
to
use
even
if
the
only
enemy
in
range
is
a
stealthed
enemy.
Evelynn's
Hate
Spike
Katarina's
Death
Lotus
Kennen's
Electrical
Surge

pointing
in
their
direction.

stealthed
champion
will
not
be
revealed.

explode
but
not
reveal
stealthed

Mocking
Shout
Viktor's

follow
a

target

fire
it's
lightning
bolts
at
it.
The
stealthed
champion
will
not
be
revealed.
Vladimir's
Tides
of
Blood
can
detect
stealthed
champions
due
to
the
particle
effect
flying
in
their
direction.
The
stealthed
champion
will
not
be
revealed.
Warwick's
Blood
Scent
does
not
reveal
stealthed
champions
but
if
they
are
within
range
and
below
half
health,
he
will
receive
the
movement
speed
bonus.
Skill
shots
While
skill
shots
that
do
damage
and/or
stun
such
as
Ashe's
Enchanted
Crystal
Arrow
will
still
hit
stealthed
champions,
they
will
still
not
be
revealed.
Note
that
the
visible
projectile
will
stop
short
of
its
trajectory
and
show
visual
and
audio
effects
(eg.
Dr
Mundo's
Infected
Cleaver
will
make
a
splatter
and
show
a
small
eruption
of
blood
upon
impact)
if
a
stealthed
unit
is
hit,
indicating
the
stealthed
champion's
presence
but
not
revealing
them.
Here
are
some
more
ways
to
detect
stealthed
enemies
since
they'll
function
the
same
as
if
they
are
unseen
in
brush.
Lux's
Light
Binding
will
visibly
entrap
the
stealthed
champion
without
revealing
the
champion.
Morgana's
Dark
Binding
will
visibly
entrap
the
stealthed
champion
without
revealing
the
champion.
Varus's
Chain
of
Corruption
will
visibly
entrap
the
stealthed
champion
without
revealing
the
champion.
Zyra's
Grasping
Roots
will
visibly
entrap
the
stealthed
champion
without
revealing
the
champion.
Urgot's
Acid
Hunter
can
still
missle
lock
on
stealthed
champions
if
hit
with
Noxian
Corrosive
Charge
.
You
won't
see
the
champion
but
you
can
see
the
debuff
animation
and
follow
it
with
your
mouse.
Hook-type
skillshots
(
Nautilus's
Dredge
Line
,
Blitzcrank's
Rocket
Grab
,
Amumu's
Bandage
Toss
and
in
some
circumstances,
Leona's
Zenith
Blade
and
Thresh's
Death
Sentence
)
will
show
the
effect
of
the
hook
happening
without
revealing
the
stealthed
champion
hit,
revealing
the
champion's
location.
Forcing
enemies
out
of
stealth
Taunting
a
stealthed
enemy
will
cause
him
to
attack,
automatically
revealing
him
and
forcing
him
out
of
stealth.
This
can
work
if
you
target
a
visible
stealthed
unit
or
if
the
enemy
is
currently
entering
into
stealth.
With
AoE
taunts,
such
as
Shen's
Shadow
Dash
or
Galio's
Idol
Of
Durand
,
this
is
easier
as
you
can
force
every
stealthed
champion
in
the
area
to
attack,
even
if
they
are
invisible.
Galio's
Idol
Of
Durand
Rammus's
Puncturing
Taunt
Shen's
Shadow
Dash
In
the
case
of
Teemo's
Camouflage
,
skills
which
force
him
to
move
-
such
as
Nautilus's
Dredge
Line
,
Blitzcrank's
Rocket
Grab
,
Hecarim's
Onslaught
of
Shadows
,
Darius's
Apprehend
and
knockbacks
will
also
force
him
out
of
stealth.
