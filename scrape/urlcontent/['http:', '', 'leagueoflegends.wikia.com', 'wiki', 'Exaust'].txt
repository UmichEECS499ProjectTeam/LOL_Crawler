Example
Exhaust
is
a
targeted
Summoner
spell
that
affects
enemy
champions.
It
reduces
movement
speed
and
damage
dealt
by
30%
and
reduces
attack
speed
by
50%.
Strategy
Exhaust
is
an
extremely
powerful
tool
for
disabling
champions
who
mainly
autoattack,
as
well
as
any
champion
that
can
deal
a
high
amount
of
damage.
When
your
team
is
chasing
an
enemy
and
he
is
getting
away,
using
Exhaust
on
him
will
help
your
team
gain
the
upper
hand.
Using
it
against
enemies
when
escaping
can
help
you
as
their
movement
speed
will
be
decreased.
Notes
Exhaust
will
not
reduce
true
damage
.
Since
V1.0.0.129
,
Cleanse
will
remove
Exhaust's
effects.
Using
Exhaust
on
a
champion
when
the
target
is
already
affected
by
that
spell
will
reapply
the
effect,
resetting
its
duration.
It
will
NOT
increase
the
effect.
