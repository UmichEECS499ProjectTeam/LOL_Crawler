Omen
is
an
unreleased
champion
that
was
left
in
the
development
stage
by
Riot
Games.
[1]
Omen
is
a
four-legged
demon-like
creature.
[2]
He
is
a
cancelled
champion
that
eventually
made
way
for
Riven
.
The
cancellation
of
Omen
was
the
cause
of
the
eventual
V1.0.0.125
delay
since
Riot
had
to
push
up
the
Riven
release.
