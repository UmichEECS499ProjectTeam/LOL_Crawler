Gold
Efficiency
The
base
stats
are
121.
6
%
gold
efficient,
without
the
passive.
The
item
is
170.
5
%
gold
efficient
at
max
stacks.
Strategy
It
is
one
of
the
most
common
items
for
casters
that
need
durability
or
mana
,
as
it
gives
a
large
amount
of
health
,
mana
,
and
ability
power
.
Rod
of
Ages
can
be
very
effectively
combined
with
an
Archangel's
Staff
,
the
passive
on
Archangel's
Staff
making
Rod
of
Ages
give
a
total
of
99.
5
ability
power
.
The
early
Tear
of
the
Goddess
and
Catalyst
the
Protector
are
useful
in
lane
for
not
only
the
mana
regen
but
also
the
healing
sustain
and
increased
mana
pool.
The
only
downside
to
this
build
is
Archangel's
Staff
/
Tear
of
the
Goddess
as
well
as
Rod
of
Ages
take
considerable
time
to
stack.
Notes
Because
this
item
takes
10
minutes
to
reach
its
full
potential,
it
is
best
obtained
early
on
in
the
game.
The
item
is
gold
efficient
at
its
base
values
so,
although
it
is
preferable
to
get
it
early,
getting
it
late
is
not
disastrous.
The
additional
stats
over
time
is
not
"unique".
One
can
have
a
second
Rod
of
Ages
and
can
put
all
stat
increases
to
use.
Trivia
Rod
of
Ages
may
have
been
originally
named
as
'Guinsoos
Rod
of
Oblivion',
and
its
icon
is
still
named
as
such

the
League

Legends
