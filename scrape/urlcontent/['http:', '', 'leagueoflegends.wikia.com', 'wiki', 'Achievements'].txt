Achievements
are
a
future
content
item
of
League
of
Legends
,
however
there
has
not
been
any
mention
to
them
for
quite
some
time.
The
"Achievements"
tab
could
be
seen
in
a
player's
profile
in-game,
though
it
could
not
be
selected.
It
was
removed
as
part
of
the
3.7
update
in
which
a
new
"Item
Sets"
tab
took
its
place.
According
to
the
tab
in
which
you
chose
your
summoner
icon,
players
will
be
able
to
unlock
more
summoner
icons
by
completing
achievements.
There
has
been
no
further
information
on
implementing
the
achievements
or
whether
or
not
it
would
be
returning.
