Indomitable
is
a
tier
3
defense
mastery
with
2
ranks.
Effect
per
rank
Reduces
incoming
damage
by
1
/
2.
Requirements
Requires
8
points
in
Defense.
Strategy
Damage
reduction
from
Indomitable
is
applied
after
damage
reduction
from
armor
and
magic
resistance.
This
makes
Indomitable
comparatively
more
effective
than
additional
armor
and
magic
resist.
It's
currently
bugged
and
does
not
reduce
any
damage
from
Baron
Nashor
and
Dragon.
