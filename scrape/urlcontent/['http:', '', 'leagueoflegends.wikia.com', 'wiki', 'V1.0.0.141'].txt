V1.0.0.140b
V1.0.0.142
This
patch
was
unusually
deployed
on
a
Sunday,
and
brought
along
with
it
some
important
bugs.
Several
games
were
not
starting
after
champion
select
and
some
players
could
not
even
access
their
accounts.
Because
of
this,
among
other
things,
the
decision
was
made
to
rollback
the
patch
and
revert
its
changes
back
to
V1.0.0.140b
.
The
rollback
was
deployed
on
June
18,
early
in
the
morning.
The
patch
was
re-released
on
June
20
on
the
NA
servers
and
was
released
on
June
29
on
the
EUW
and
EUNE
servers.
On
Friday,
June
22,
CaptSturm
issued
a
statement
on
the
forums
regarding
the
many
issues
brought
about
by
this
patch.

Scorched
Earth
Xerath
PvP.net
V1.61
Players
can
now
earn
unlimited
rewards
per
day
in
Co-op
vs.
AI.
After
180
minutes,
rewards
continue
to
be
earned
at
75%
the
normal
rate.
Custom
games
now
have
a
separate
pool
of
120
daily
reward
minutes
that
is
no
longer
shared
with
Co-op
vs.
AI.
This
only
applies
to
Summoners
level
15+.
Lower
level
Summoners
earn
unlimited
rewards
per
day.
Updated
the
IP
reward
formula
for
Co-op
vs.
AI:
Games
of
medium
to
long
length
will
yield
larger
rewards.
Games
of
short
length
will
yield
smaller
rewards.
On
Summoner's
Rift,
"short"
is
generally
less
than
24
minutes.
On
the
Crystal
Scar,
"short"
is
generally
less
than
12
minutes.
Players
should
see
an
increase
in
IP
reward
per
game
so
long
as
they
aren't
quickly
steamrolling
the
bots.
Tournament
Draft
Custom
Game
mode
will
now
allow
Summoners
to
pause
the
game.
Dodging
a
ranked
game
will
no
longer
result
in
loss
of
Elo
but
the
time
before
you
can
join
any
queue
again
has
greatly
increased.
30
minutes
for
first
dodge
has
been
observed.
Adjusted
the
way
Elo
is
handled
for
newly
formed
ranked
teams;
many
new
teams
will
see
their
Elo
increase
as
a
result.
Normal
Draft
Mode
(please
note
that
these
additions
were
incorrectly
stated
in
the
V1.0.0.140
patch
notes):
Solo
players
have
a
20%
chance
of
being
the
team
captain
with
banning
powers
and
first
pick,
regardless
of
the
premade
status
of
the
rest
of
the
team.
If
a
solo
player
is
not
team
captain,
the
player
will
be
given
a
random
slot
in
the
pick
order.
If
players
group
up
before
a
game,
their
host
absorbs
all
of
their
chances,
i.e.
the
host
of
a
4-man
premade
has
an
80%
chance
to
be
captain.
A
feedback
sound
now
plays
when
spending
mastery
points.

Known
bugs
The
following
bugs
were
each
partly
responsible
for
the
rollback
that
followed
the
patch:
Players
could
not
log
into
their
accounts.
Teammates
of
pre-made
teams
cannot
invite
their
friends
into
their
team.
After
the
final
count
down
of
the
Champion
selection
screen,
the
PVP.net
client
never
proceeds
to
the
game
client.
The
following
bug
emerged
from
residual
changes
left
over
after
this
patch's
rollback:
In
Co-op
vs.
AI,
Alistar
Bot
and
Dr.
Mundo
Bot
still
appear
on
the
bot
roster
but
they
never
leave
the
summoner
platform.
This
bug
is
due
to
the
fact
that
their
AI
scripts
were
originally
unavailable
in
V1.0.0.140b
but
they
were
not
removed
from
the
bot
roster
during
the
rollback.
In
Co-op
vs
AI
on
Summoner's
Rift,
the
lane
assignment
for
bots
becomes
random.
The
following
bugs
occurred
following
the
re-release
of
the
patch,
prompting
the
disabling
of
ranked
queues
and
a
half
day
of
downtime,
with
continuing
downtime
and
bugs
for
the
following
2
weeks:
Players
receiving
long
or
infinite
length
login
queuing.
All
player
data,
IP,
RP,
and
champions
missing.
No
chat
functionality.
Players
disconnecting
and
reconnecting
uncontrollably
repeatedly.
Game
freezes.
Ultimates
failing
to
function.
Lag
spikes.
Hotfix
The
following
hotfix
was
deployed
on
June
29
th
,
2012.
Fixed
a
bug
that
occasionally
caused
Baron
Nashor
to
attack
and
cast
at
a
faster
rate.
Fixed
a
bug
where
some
Champions
were
occasionally
freezing
during
their
jump
abilities.
Fixed
a
bug
that
was
causing
various
Champions
to
become
stuck
in
walls.
Made
a
change
that
will
reduce
the
number
of
disconnects
and
reconnects
that
players
are
experiencing.
Fixed
a
bug
that
was
not
allowing
players
to
scroll
using
the
mouse
wheel.
Fixed
a
bug
that
was
occasionally
selecting
the
wrong
set
of
masteries
when
players
used
the
Edit
option.
Fixed
a
crash
that
occurred
on
the
game
loading
screen.
