Elixir
of
Fortitude
is
a
consumable
item
in
League
of
Legends
.
[1]
Strategy
It
is
often
used
towards
the
end
of
the
game
to
help
with
a
final
push
or
to
help
defend.
It
is
best
for
a
champion
that
relies
heavily
on
physical
damage,
but
it
has
benefit
for
all
champions
due
to
the
additional
health.
The
health
bonus
can
be
used
somewhat
like
Heal
,
instantly
granting
you
extra
life
that
could
save
you
from
death.
This
is
a
common
tactic
to
turn
the
tide
in
an
early
fight
or
to
survive
a
gank.
For
example,
having
one
ready
to
use
is
an
effective
way
to
prevent
a
death
early
or
mid
game
to
Karthus's
Requiem
.
Because
the
extra
health
is
not
gained
by
health
regeneration
or
healing,
it
can
be
considered
an
effective
counter
to
Ignite
.
Elixirs
are
often
bought
towards
the
end
of
long
games
when
builds
are
all
completed
and
the
extra
gold
continues
to
accumulate.
They
can
also
be
bought
mid
game
to
give
a
temporary
stat
advantage
during
ganks
and
teamfights.
Notes
Elixirs
are
automatically
applied
when
purchased
if
there
are
already
6
items
in
the
inventory.
Trivia
The
Piece
of
Red
Candy
was
a
seasonal
item
that
replaced
the
Elixir
of
Fortitude
during
the
Harrowing
celebration.
It
was
the
same
item
with
a
different
name
and
picture.
The
Red
Ginseng
Kettle
was
another
seasonal
item
that
replaced
the
Elixir
of
Fortitude
during
the
Lunar
Revel
celebration.
The
Mightshroom
was
yet
another
seasonal
item
that
replaced
the
Elixir
of
Fortitude
during
the
Great
Hunt
.
In
V1.0.0.101
,
this
item
was
bugged
on
Jax
to
grant
him
maximum
health
when
consumed.

history
v3.6
Elixir
of
Fortitude
is
meant
to
be
an
"all-in"
burst
of
power
for
players
looking
to
take
control
of
a
situation.
With
its
low
cost,
however,
players
were
simply
defaulting
to
it
as
a
general
starting
item
with
no
significant
repercussion.
Increasing
the
gold
cost
of
Elixir
of
Fortitude
aligns
it
better
with
the
risky
strategy
it
was
intended
for.
Cost
increased
to
350
gold
from
250
V1.0.0.107
:

10
from
11-28.
Cost
reduced
to
250
from
300.
V1.0.0.99
:
Elixirs
will
now
activate
immediately
if
purchased
when
your
inventory
is
full.
V1.0.0.87
:
Damage
buff
changed
to
grant
10-28
damage
based
on
Champion
level
rather
than
a
flat
20
damage.
V1.0.0.70
:
Elixirs
are
no
longer
lost
upon
pseudo-death
(
Guardian
Angel
,

Shift
,
etc.).

:
Health
modified
to
230-400
based
on

from

350.

25,

bonus

from
