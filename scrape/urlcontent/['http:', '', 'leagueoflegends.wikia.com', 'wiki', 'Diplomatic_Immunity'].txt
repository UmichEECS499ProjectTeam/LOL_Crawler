Poppy,
the
Iron
Ambassador
is
a
champion
in
League
of
Legends
.
[1]
Abilities
Valiant
Fighter
Whenever
Poppy
would
otherwise
suffer
damage
greater
than
10%
of
her
current
health
all
damage
exceeding
that
threshold
is
halved;
Poppy
receives
the
first
10%
normally.
Valiant
Fighter
has
no
internal
cooldown
and
is
not
affected
by
structures.
Ability
Details
Valiant
Fighter
is
a
self-buff
ability.
Additional
Information:
Valiant
Fighter
does
not
trigger
if
the
damage
being
received
is
equal
to
or
less
than
10%
of
Poppy's
current
health.
For
example,
if
the
damage
dealt
after
reduction
is
100
but
her
current
health
is
over
1000,
Valiant
Fighter
does
not
trigger.
Valiant
Fighter's
damage
reduction
only
applies
to
the
portion
of
the
total
damage
that
is
more
than
10%
of
Poppy's
health,
not
the
entire
damage
and
does
not
apply
to
any
true
damage
.
For
example,
Poppy
has
1000
out
of
2000
health
and
is
being
hit
by
a
400
damage
attack
after
reductions.
The
full
damage
portion
she
will
take
of
400
is
10%
of
1000
(i.e.
100).
Then
the
portion
of
the
400
damage
attack
that
exceeds
her
current
100
hp
is
300.
The
exceeding
300
damage
will
be
reduced
by
50%
by
her
passive,
reducing
it
to
150.
The
whole
damage
dealt
will
be
250
(100
+
150)
instead
of
400
because
150
was
reduced
by
Valiant
Fighter.
Formula
for
damage
>
10%
of
Poppy's
current
health:
(
[damage
received]
-
(
[current
health]
x
0.1)
)
x
0.5
+
(
[current
health]
x
0.1)
=
actual
damage
taken.
Valiant
Fighter's
damage
reduction
applies
to
absorption
shields.
