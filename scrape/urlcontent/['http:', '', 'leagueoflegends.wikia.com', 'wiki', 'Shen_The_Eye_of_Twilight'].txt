Ability
Details
Stand
United
is
an
ally-targeted
blink
ability.
Additional
Information:
Shen
cannot
target
himself
with
Stand
United.
Shen
can
alternatively
target
an
ally
by
clicking
on
their
respective
champion
portrait
on
the
left
side
of
the
screen
or
using
the
F1
to
F5
keys.
Shen
cannot
target
allies
of
whom
he
does
not
currently
have
sight
of
due
to
a
vision-restricting
effect,
such
as
Nocturne's
Paranoia
or
Graves's
Smokescreen
.
This
includes
prevention
of
casting
it
using
the
aforementioned
methods
of
clicking
the
champion
portraits
and
F1-5
keys.
Using
Stand
United
on
a
stealthed
ally
will
not
remove
their
stealth.
Shen's
teleport
is
not
contingent
on
the
state
of
his
ally's
shield.
Breaking
the
shield
will
not
cancel
Shen's
channel
nor
will
breaking
Shen's
channel
remove
the
shield
prematurely.
