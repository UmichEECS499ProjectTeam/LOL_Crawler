Redirected
from
Leaving
Leaver
Buster
is
an
automated
system
that
Riot
implemented
to
discourage
players
from
leaving
League
of
Legends
matches.
Leaving
the
game
during
champion
selection:
Punishment
(normal
match):
1st
offense
-
Player
is
unable
to
join
the
matchmaking
queue
for
6
minutes.
2nd
and
following
offenses
-
Player
is
unable
to
join
the
matchmaking
queue
for
15
minutes.
In
addition
to
the
above
time
penalties
if
the
game
was
a
ranked
match
,
the
player
loses
3
League
Points,
for
the
first
offense
and
10LP
for
the
second
time
before
the
timer
reset.
This
counter
resets
after
8
hours
without
leaving
during
champion
select.
This
counter
is
shared
between
normal
and
ranked.
Leaving
the
game
before
the
match
is
over:
The
Leaver
Buster
system
will
automatically
kick
players
who
remain
idle
for
5
minutes.
Punishment
(All):
No
XP/IP
granted
for
the
abandoned
game
Punishment
(Normal
Match):
A
leave
is
added
to
the
player's
profile.
Punishment
(Ranked
Match):
A
loss
is
added
to
the
player's
profile.
(Even
if
the
players
team
wins)
If
a
game
doesn't
end
(for
example
for
server
issues,
or
because
every
player
left
the
match),
no
penalties
are
given
out.
After
receiving
a
certain
number
of
leaves,
which
varies
depending
on
the
total
number
of
games
played
and
the
distance
in
time
between
each
leave,
the
player
account
gets
first
warned
and
then
suspended
for
increasingly
long
periods
of
time,
resulting
in
a
permanent
ban
for
re-iterated
offenses.
