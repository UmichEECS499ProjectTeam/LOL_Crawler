Ionia
Demands
a
Rematch
with
Noxus
Diplomats
challenge
League
ruling
on
Noxian
occupation
Nick
Vand
reporting
from
Ionia
Irelia,
the
Captain
of
the
Guard
for
Ionia,
issues
her
demands
at
a
press
conference
in
Ionia.
In
Ionia
's
majestic
Lotus
Gardens,
the
Shojin
monk
still
burns
in
a
silent
protest
against
the
Noxian
occupation
of
southern
Ionia.
This
tragic
act
has
prompted
demands
from
many
Ionians
to
have
all
Noxians
forcibly
removed
from
their
land.
However,
Ionian
diplomats
chose
to
focus
on
a
different
and
new
initiative
this
week.
They
have
asked
that
the
League
review
its
judgment
on
the
Ionian
occupation.
They
say
that
fifteen
years
is
too
long
to
grant
the
invading
and
plundering
Noxian
government.
While
there
are
officially
still
eight
years
before
a
match
can
be
scheduled
to
appeal
the
results
of
the
previous
battle,
the
Ionians
are
demanding
a
rematch
now.
At
the
head
of
this
effort
is
Irelia,
the
Ionian
Captain
of
the
Guard
.
Irelia
is
credited
as
one
of
the
leaders
of
the
Ionian
resistance
during
the
Noxian
invasion.
Many
Ionians
believe
that
Noxus
would
have
succeeded
in
their
conquest
if
not
for
her
efforts.
She
has
since
been
hailed
as
a
symbol
of
freedom
for
the
Ionian
people.
In
a
recent
press
conference,
she
had
this
to
say:
"Noxian
propaganda
has
hidden
the
plight
of
the
people.
The
damage
we
have
suffered
has
been
severe.
The
cruelty
inflicted
on
the
citizens
of
Ionia
during
this
hostile
invasion
is
unforgivable,
and
we
endure
the
insult
of
occupation
to
this
day.
All
the
while,
the
League
blindly
turns
away.
It
is
time
for
those
blind
eyes
to
see.
We
have
been
wronged.
We
will
not
endure
this
pain
for
one
second
longer,
much
less
eight
more
years."
Noxus
claims
that
aggressions
against
Ionia
have
ended.
There
are
diplomatic
efforts
that
verify
those
claims.
Regardless,
Noxian
forces
still
occupy
the
provinces
of
Galrin,
Navori,
and
Shon-Xan
in
southern
Ionia.
Chancellor
Malek
Hawkmoon
of
the
Noxian
High
Command,
the
current
overseer
of
Noxian
forces
in
Ionia,
made
a
statement
discrediting
Ionia's
accusations.
"Conflicts
arise
for
many
reasons.
Our
conflict
with
Ionia
is
no
different.
Those
who
lose
always
try
to
gain
sympathy
when
violence
fails
them.
Ionia
claims
to
be
helpless
victims;
what,
then,
of
the
countless
Noxian
and
Zaunite
soldiers
buried
beneath
Ionian
soil?
Ionia
is
trying
to
manipulate
the
emotions
of
the
League.
However,
the
justice
of
our
presence
in
Ionia
was
decided
by
the
League
itself.
It
is
legal,
and
according
to
the
terms
of
our
fair
victory,
set
to
last
another
eight
years."
Ionia
has
powerful
support
from
outside
its
borders,
however.
In
a
stunningly
direct
speech,
Jarvan
IV
,
the
crown
prince
of
Demacia
,
spoke
out
against
the
occupation.
"Who
among
us
believes
these
Noxian
lies?
Who
among
us
doesn't
know
the
truth?
I'm
tired
of
wading
through
the
political
double-talk.
Noxus
invaded
Ionia
as
no
more
than
thieves
or
bandits.
They
continue
to
operate
as
such,
remaining
neatly
between
the
lines
of
the
edicts
of
the
League
of
Legends.
Those
who
remain
silent
do
so
out
of
fear.
I
am
not
afraid.
I
will
oppose
villainy
wherever
I
find
it,
without
compromise.
If
the
League
is
unwilling
to
remove
the
Noxian
infestation,
then
I
will
visit
Ionia
myself."
Piltover
Inventor
Recovered
from
Kumungu
Warning
issued
against
travel
south
of
the
Great
Barrier
Auras
Lam
reporting
from
the
Institute
of
War
A
young
inventor
from
Piltover
previously
reported
missing
for
the
last
three
months
was
found
earlier
this
week
in
the
jungles
of
Kumungu.
Piltover
officials
mobilized
all
available
rescue
teams
to
recover
the
well-known
14-year-old
prodigy
of
techmaturgy,
after
he
disappeared
in
early
June.
He
was
discovered
afflicted
with
a
withering
disease
and
close
to
death
in
the
northern
region
of
Kumungu
by
a
Piltover
Rescue
Bot.
The
bot
is
a
recent
prototype
created
by
famed
inventor
and
League
champion
Heimerdinger
,
and
it
has
been
used
recently
as
a
support
unit
for
the
Bandle
City
Expeditionary
Force
in
Piltover.
The
rescue
team
transported
the
boy
swiftly
back
to
the
city-state,
and
he
was
quarantined
to
prevent
spreading
the
disease.
The
race
is
now
on
to
save
his
life,
with
reports
that
Piltover's
top
medical
staff
has
been
attending
to
the
boy's
condition
around
the
clock.
A
source
within
the
Piltover
Patrol
described
the
boy's
status
as
dire.
The
source
went
on
to
state:
"His
body
is
ravaged
by
a
strange
disease.
Even
with
the
advanced
state
of
[Piltover's]
medical
care,
the
disease
is
spreading
too
quickly
for
his
young
body
to
cope
with."
His
name
is
being
withheld
because
he
is
a
minor.
This
incident
is
the
latest
in
a
rash
of
missing
explorers
reported
from
nearly
every
city-state
in
Valoran
.
Of
the
fifty-six
rescue
missions
launched
in
response
to
these
reports
in
the
last
year,
only
three
have
returned
successful.
In
response
to
the
mounting
dangers,
the
League
has
increased
security
measures,
focusing
their
efforts
on
restricting
unnecessary
travel
through
Mogron
Pass
.
While
League-sanctioned
security
garrisons
have
recently
been
reinforced
in
response
to
the
assault
last
month
by
unidentified
attackers,
a
security
checkpoint
is
now
in
place
to
screen
travelers
and
assess
potential
risks.
The
checkpoint
is
guarded
by
League
members
representing
each
city-state
on
a
rotating
shift.
Anticipating
some
discontent
over
the
establishment
of
a
security
checkpoint,
League
political
advisor
Deacon
Cavarieles
issued
a
statement:
"While
travelers
may
consider
this
to
be
an
unnecessary
inconvenience,
we
feel
that
it
is
absolutely
necessary
to
defend
travelers
from
personal
harm,
as
well
as
the
citizens
of
Valoran
from
the
threat
of
an
epidemic.
The
checkpoint
will
remain
in
place
until
the
League
has
reason
to
believe
that
the
citizens
of
northern
Valoran
are
properly
observing
safe
travel
habits
and
that
lives
are
no
longer
being
lost."
Effective
immediately,
the
new
law
requires
that
all
travelers
passing
through
the
Great
Barrier
must
present
League–issued
documentation
to
the
guards
at
Mogron
Pass.
Travelers
with
valid
reasons
for
crossing
the
barrier
include,
but
are
not
limited
to:
explorers
escorted
by
a
League-approved
member,
scientific
researchers
and
historians
whose
missions
have
been
explicitly
approved
by
the
League,
or
trade
merchants
heading
directly
to
Bandle
City.
Inquiries
for
purposes
other
than
what
is
listed
in
the
guidelines
should
be
directed
to
the
League
Security
Council.
Any
travelers
attempting
to
cross
without
the
proper
authority
will
be
denied
without
exception.
Harrowing
Traditions
Another
day
we
are
forced
to
interact
with
each
other
L.B.
Briskes
commenting
from
the
Institute
of
War
The
Harrowing
is,
by
far,
the
most
relaxing
Runeterran
holiday.
You
may
point
out,
"But
L.B.,
you
find
people
and
their
fickle
traditions
almost
as
odious
as
your
obnoxious,
sweater-clad
neighbor;
the
one
apparently
afflicted
by
digestive
dysfunction."
To
you
I
say
this:
my
neighbor,
whose
washroom
practices
cause
the
paint
to
peel
on
my
side
of
the
wall,
could
not,
in
his
rankest
moments,
ever
match
the
foulness
with
which
I
view
people
and
society
as
a
whole.
He
does
try
though.
Why,
then,
is
this
holiday
the
best?
Masks.
Not
only
do
masks
grant
me
a
welcome
reprieve
from
your
eager,
grinning
faces,
but
they
also
help
me
disguise
my
insistent
loathing
in
some
more
appropriate
semblance
of
neutrality.
Suppressing
a
scowl
as
determined
as
mine
(let
alone
plastering
a
smile
over
it)
is
an
exhaustive
effort.
On
the
Harrowing
we
commemorate
a
time
when
both
creepies
and
crawlies
are
at
their
creepiest
and
crawliest,
and
the
world
falls
to
the
mercy
of
forces
from
the
great
beyond.
This
superstition
is
no
doubt
prompted
by
the
fact
that,
on
this
day,
Valoran
is
blanketed
in
darkness
as
the
moon
eclipses
the
sun.
Naturally,
to
ward
off
the
impending
evil,
we
adorn
ourselves
in
"light"
or
"dark"
garments
and
drink
pumpkin-spiced
spirits.
It
is
a
well-documented
fact
that
ghosts
and
ghouls
fear
orange
vegetables
almost
as
much
as
they
fear
silly
outfits.
Admittedly,
the
light/dark
costume
parties
are
far
more
tolerable
than
their
costume-less
counterparts.
People
of
opposite
genders
and
costume
colors
can
skip
past
the
first
twenty
minutes
of
introductory
drivel
–
inevitably
the
moments
most
likely
to
spoil
what
could
otherwise
be
a
pleasant
night
of
irresponsibility
–
and
be
matched
arbitrarily
by
fortune.
Where
did
this
tradition
start,
though?
The
Harrowing
has
been
a
recorded
day
of
celebration
for
hundreds,
perhaps
thousands,
of
years.
Fans
of
the
Apocalypse
claim
that
the
world
nearly
ended
in
fire
(or
ice
or
kittens
or
what
have
you)
when
the
moon
eclipsed
Valoran
countless
years
ago.
The
historical
texts
which
survived
the
Rune
Wars
only
go
so
far,
but
they
claim
that
costumes
are
worn
either
to
support
the
forces
of
light/good
or
to
confuse
the
forces
of
dark/evil.
The
many
rituals
which
have
cropped
up
surrounding
the
interactions
of
people
dressed
in
opposing
colors
seem
to
be
a
more
recent
addition
to
the
holiday,
apparently
symbolic
of
the
reconciliation
of
some
long-forgotten
grudge.
Observance
of
the
Harrowing
differs
greatly
between
the
city-state-dwellers
and
the
rural
citizens
of
Valoran.
In
the
city-states,
most
people
gather
to
make
merry
and
act
foolish;
in
the
country,
some
of
the
eldest
sons
still
keep
late
watches,
prepared
to
light
signal
fires
to
warn
of
impending
danger.
Unfortunately,
for
all
the
hullabaloo
there
haven’t
been
any
outbreaks
of
malevolent
beings,
no
visits
of
nefarious
apparitions,
not
so
much
as
one
documented
creepy
nor
one
captured
crawlie.
The
world
seems
hopelessly
saturated
with
people,
and
nothing
has
been
sufficient
to
threaten
that
state.
So,
unburdened
by
worry,
you
may
happily
don
your
home-sewn
Veigar
cowl
or
your
jury-rigged
Heimer
hairdo
and
take
comfort
in
the
fact
that,
if
this
day
ever
bore
the
portent
of
Armageddon,
that
time
has
long
since
past.
Wait,
what’s
that
behind
you?

you
learn
a
bit
about

Not

a

Captain
for

years,
and
the

and
lads
about
town
here
in
Valoran
are
no
exception.
Here're
a
few
whispers
I've
picked
up
on
about
what
a
few
of
your
favorites
are
up
to
when
they're

Katarina,
Privateer
of
Noxus
While
the
League
may
have
put
a
stop
to
Noxian
hostilities
on
Ionian
soil,
Katarina
's
still
guvner
on
the
high
seas.
Ever
since
their
campaign
ended,
Noxus'
very
own
Sinister
Blade
has
been
a
mainstay
down
at
Bilgewater
's
Fleet
Street,
poking
her
head
into
the
pubs
and
taverns
along
the
way
in
search
of
sailors
down
on
their
luck.
An
even
share
of
the
plunder
sounds
spot
on
to
a
lad
on
his
last
dram,
even
if
it
means
a
short
drop
and
a
sudden
stop
for
anyone
unfortunate
enough
to
run
afoul
of
an
Ionian
vessel
during
the
rest
of
his
seafaring
career.
While
the
League's
bound
to
land
their
mitts
on
anyone
foolish
enough
to
attack
a
vessel
in
protected
waters,
there's
plenty
of
jink
to
be
had
for
those
intrepid
enough
to
venture
out
into
the
open
seas.
Trouble
is,
out
there
you're
on
your
own...
and
I
know
at
least
one
little
missy
who's
sharpening
a
dagger
with
your
name
on
it,
ready
to
take
your
hard
earned
Valors
before
they're
spent.
Lesson
learned:
never
give
a
Noxian
an
excuse
to
hang
onto
a
grudge,
or
you'll
be
keeping
a
weather
eye
on
the
horizon
for
the
rest
of
your
natural
life.
Captain
Gangplank
at
the
Governor's
Waltz?
Captain
Gangplank
may
be
barmy
as
a
buzzard
-
having
earned
his
reputation
plundering
hapless
vessels,
swilling
grog,
and
hanging
mutineers
from
the
yardarm
-
but
did
you
know
that
the
old
Captain
loves
to
dance?
Whilst
I
was
haunting
about
one
of
my
usual
ports
of
call,
by
happenstance
I
managed
to
wrangle
an
invitation
to
the
governor's
ball.
I
thought
for
sure
I'd
be
the
only
blighter
from
Bilgewater
on
the
scene,
but
apparently
there're
a
few
chaps
out
there
who
can
still
put
one
over
on
a
salty
dog
like
myself.
There
on
the
other
side
of
the
ballroom
was
none
other
than
the
Saltwater
Scourge
himself...
except
he's
looking
all
proper
and
sharing
a
glass
of
sherry
with
a
handsome
damsel!
Since
it
was
the
first
time
I’d
seen
him
while
I
wasn't
looking
over
the
barrel
of
a
gun
at
a
man
with
powder
burns
in
his
beard,
I
thought
it
might
be
a
good
time
to
bury
the
hatchet
over
those
30
tons
of
rum
he
nipped
from
me
last
season.
After
I'd
assured
him
there
were
no
hard
feelings,
he
shared
with
me
a
hint
of
seaman's
wisdom,
one
captain
to
another:
"There's
nary
a
better
way
to
get
your
ground
legs
under
you
than
a
trip
round
the
dance
floor
with
a
buxom
lady."

Senior

Ralston
Farnsley
commenting
from
the
Institute
of
War
After
scouring
the
latest
deliveries
from
the
Mailbag
of
Justice,
it
seems
that
there
is
a
great
deal
of
curiosity
surrounding
champions
who
have
answered
the
call
from
off
world.
Of
equal
interest
were
questions
surrounding
the
actual
implications
to
a
champion
of
being
slain
and
revived
on
the
Field
of
Justice
.
Interesting
questions,
friends,
and
today
you'll
have
your
answers!
"So
I
understand
how
strong
our
magic
is
to
control

but
one
thing
has
bothered
me
since

Do
we
really
kill
the
champions
themselves
over
and
over
again?"

Field
of
Justice
is
a
truly
remarkable
feat,
and
the
magic
at
play
is
beyond
the
comprehension
of
all
but
the
most
gifted
of
magicians.
Once
a
battle
begins,
the
Field
of
Justice
becomes
a
kind
of
microcosm.
Within
this
sphere
of
influence
the
champion
and
summoner
exist
as
one
shared
mind.
This
does
not
mean
that
the
champion
is
not
in
mortal
danger.
Death
severs
the
connection
between
summoner
and
host
champion
and
is
an
extremely
traumatic
experience
for
both
parties.
After
the
summoner
has
recovered,
they
can
reenter
the
battle
arena
by
completing
the
summoning
ritual
again.
At
this
point
the
champion
is
revived
on
the
summoning
platform,
once
again
entering
the
fray
at
the
risk
of
their
own
life.
For
this
precise
reason,
champions
and
summoners
are
a
rare
breed.
"As
we
know,
there
are
some
champions
that
their
land
of
origin
is
unknown
--
for
example:
Taric
and
Nasus
.
Since
my
duties
as
a
scholar
direct
so,
and
the
head
librarian
gets
on
my
nerves
by
his
constant
questioning,
could
either
of
them
Taric
or
Nasus
be
so
kind
as
to
and
tell
we
summoners
a
couple
of
things
about
their
homeworld?"
-
Scholar
Aribrar
An
interesting
question
indeed,
Aribrar.
While
I
was
unable
to
get
either
of
these
champions
to
comment
directly
on
their
home
for
this
response,
I
am
happy
to
share
with
you
some
of
my
own
experiences
with
them.
Taric
is
usually
quite
open
to
queries
regarding
his
world.
Taric
usually
describes
his
home
as
a
magnificent
place
where
gems
are
coveted
as
sources
of
magic
in
the
same
way
that
we
revere
runes.
As
a
word
of
warning,
however,
if
you
manage
to
find
him
sitting
at
the
local
tavern,
be
prepared
for
a
long
conversation
and
an
equally
long
bar
tab.
You
can
expect
a
full
explanation
of
the
significance
of
each
gem,
which
are
his
favorites,
where
they
are
found,
etc.
After
that
he'll
usually
launch
into
a
longwinded
tale
about
how
he
learned
herbalism
from
his
father
before
crusading
off
to
defend
the
verdant
jungles
and
forests
of
his
homeland.
For
Taric,
the
preservation
of
the
world
of
Runeterra
is
just
as
important.
Nasus,
on
the
other
hand,
is
far
more
tight-lipped
about
his
land
of
origin.
While
it's
known
that
he
was
once
caretaker
of
a
Great
Library,
all
you'll
get
out
of
him
are
grumblings
about
how
his
brother
Renekton
will
never
let
go
of
their
grudge
regardless
of
how
many
worlds
stand
between
them.
Pair
that
with
a
few
riddles
about
the
cycle
of
life
and
death,
and
that's
about
you'll
hear
from
the
Curator
of
the
Sands
before
he's
brooding
again.
"I
have
heard
very
little
of
Anivia
and
her
dealings
since
she
came
to
Runeterra.
Where
does
she
stand
on
the
current
happenings
in
the
world
and
does
she
long
for
her
home
world?"
-
Adhemar
Anivia's
sense
of
duty
as
an
elemental
protector
has
always
outweighed
any
homesickness
she
feels.
While
she
has
often
spoken
longingly
of
her
icy
home,
she
seems
to
be
equally
at
home
in
her
nest
high
in
the
peaks
of
the
Ironspike
Mountains.
Through
her
friendship
with
Ashe
,
Anivia's
ties
to
the
region
of
Freljord
have
grown
stronger
since
Ashe’s
marriage
to
Tryndamere
and
the
subsequent
formation
of
Freljord
as
a
city-state.
While
Anivia
still
views
herself
as
a
defender
of
all
of
Runeterra,
it
would
be
surprising
if
the
Cryophoenix
did
not
show
some
attachment
to
her
chosen
homeland
in
future
political
disputes.
