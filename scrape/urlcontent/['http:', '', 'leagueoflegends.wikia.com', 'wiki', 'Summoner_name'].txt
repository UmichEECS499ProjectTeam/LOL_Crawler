Description
Summoners
A
player
in
League
of
Legends
takes
on
the
role
of
a
summoner
,
a
gifted
spell
caster
who
has
the
power
to
bring
forth
a
champion
to
fight
as
their
avatar
in
Valoran's
Fields
of
Justice
.
With
all
major
political
decisions
on
Valoran
now
decided
by
the
outcome
of
the
contests
that
take
place
in
the
battle
arenas,
a
summoner
is
the
key
force
of
change
on
the
continent.
As
the
summoner
controls
the
champion
in
combat,
the
summoner
also
influences
the
outcome
of
the
match
through
the
use
of
summoner
spells
,
runes
,
and
masteries
.
Once
a
match
is
over,
the
summoner
gains
experience
and
influence
points
.
Experience
points
allow
the
summoner
to
gain
increased
powers
by
unlocking
additional
spells
and
rune
slots,
while
influence
points
allow
the
summoner
to
gain
access
to
new
champions
and
new
runes
for
use
in
future
fights.

The
Code
Main
article:
The
Summoner's
Code
The
Summoner's
Code
is
a
list
of
rules
and
guidelines
that
Riot
Games
provides
to
the
players
to
abide
to
when
participating
in
competitive
play.
If
a
summoner
disobeys
this
code
they
might
find
themselves
suspended
for
an
amount
of
time.
Repeated
and/or
severe
infractions
will
incur
harsher
penalties.
Any
player
can
report
a
summoner
that
has
disobeyed
the
code
in
a
match;
if
this
summoner
gets
reported
a
sufficient
number
of
times,
his
actions
will
be
reviewed
by
other
summoners
in
the
Tribunal
.
Customization
Main
article:
Summoner
profile
The
summoner
will
represent
a
player
and
track
its
stats
as
games
are
played.
As
you
progress
in
the
game,
the
summoner
will
accumulate
Influence
Points
allowing
access
to
more
champions
and
runes.
Champions
skins
can
also
be
customized,
but
those
are
only
purchasable
with
Riot
Points
.
Summoner
spells
Main
article:
Summoner
spells
Summoners
are
allowed
the
use
of
any
two
of
the
summoner
spells
during
any
battle
in
the
Fields
of
Justice,
many
are
available
from
the
start
while
others
are
unlocked
through
gaining
levels.
These
spells
are
controlled
by
the
left
hand
and
significantly
impact
gameplay.
There
is
one
specific
mastery
in
Preseason
4
that
lowers
the
cooldown
of
summoner
spells,
which
is
Summoner's
Insight
Runes
Main
article:
Runes
Before
a
battle
arena
match
begins,
a
summoner
can
make
use
of
Runes
to
enhance
their
champion's
abilities.
Runes
can
only
be
purchased
with
Influence
Points
at
the
Riot
Store
.
Runes
may
not
be
bought
with
Riot
Points,
this
is
to
help
prevent
people
from
buying
power,
although
you
can
acquire
runes
faster
by
buying
a
Influence
Points
Boost.
Masteries
Main
article:
Masteries
Masteries
are
perks
that
affect
gameplay,
they
are
commonly
referred
to
in
other
games
as
"skill-trees".
All
of
the
masteries
are
passive
effects
although
some
augment
summoner
spells,
which
can
be
activated.
A
summoner
is
able
to
focus
their
intense
magical
training
into
specific
categories
(Offensive,
Defensive,
and
Utility).
Each
group
has
6
tiers,
within
a
group
all
but
the
first
tier
are
locked
when
you
first
start,
with
a
successive
tier
opening
with
each
4
points
spent
in
the
same
group.
Lines
in
the
mastery
tree
imply
additional
unlocking
criteria.
The
summoner
can
put
one
point
per
level
(up
to
level
30)
into
masteries.
Masteries
can
be
re-distributed
at
will
between
battles.
Since
May
23,
2011
,
summoners
are
allowed
to
have
multiple
saved
mastery
pages.
Summoner
icons
Main
article:
Summoner
icons
A
summoner
icon
is
a
picture
that
represents
a
summoner
in
a
chat
room
and
on
his
or
her
friend
list.
Currently,
players
may
only
choose
from
a
limited
set
of
icons,
but
the
selection
will
probably
be
expanded
in
the
future.
Halloween
and
Christmas
2012
you
could
reach
different
new
icons,
for
example
Baron
Nashor
with
a
christmas
hat.
But
you
had
to
do
something
for
them,
for
example
do
a
ranked
5vs5
with
a
team
or
send
a
friend
some
RP
or
a
skin.
Riot
store
Boosts
can
be
bought
to
gain
experience
and
influence
points
faster,
the
boosts
are
also
rewards
for
the
original
Refer
A
Friend
program.
Since
May
2011
,
players
can
change
their
Summoner's
name
by
spending
Riot
Points
,
currently
set
to
the
price
of
1300
.
