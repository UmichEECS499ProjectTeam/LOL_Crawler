Bio
Founded
by
HotshotGG
on
April
16,
2010,
Counter
Logic
Gaming
(abbreviated
CLG)
began
its
presence
in
League
of
Legends
eSports
with
Bigfatlip,
Chauster,
Elementz
and
Kobe24
as
its
beginning
roster.
The
first
event
they
attended
was
in
October
at
the
2010
World
Cyber
Games
Grand
Finals
,
where
the
scored
1st
place
against
SK
Gaming
in
the
finals.
Then
in
January
2011,
their
founding
member,
Kobe24,
retires.
The
following
month
Saintvicious
joins
the
team
to
take
his
place.
August
came
and
CLG
participated
in
both
IEM
VI
-
Cologne
and
MLG
2011
-
Raleigh
,
earning
first
place
at
both
events.
As
they
started
to
collect
these
victories
and
add
them
to
their
team
name
Doublelift
joins
as
their
AD
in
November,
but
Elementz
leaves
the
team
the
following
month
in
Decemeber.
The
next
decision
for
CLG
was
to
move
to
South
Korea
to
participate
in
Azubu
The
Champions
Spring
2012
in
March
2012.
Yet
they
were
knocked
out
of
the
tournament
in
the
playoffs
by
MiG
Blaze
(now
Azubu
Blaze)
and
they
returned
home
to
North
America.
Voyboy
joined
the
team
in
May
to
replace
Saintvicious,
and
the
team
renames
itself
to
Counter
Logic
Gaming
Prime.
They
move
on
to
the
MLG
2012
-
Spring
Championship
that
took
place
in
June.
CLG
Prime
battled
all
the
way
to
the
finals
to
face
TSM
.
Even
though
the
first
round
went
to
CLG
Prime
in
the
best
of
three,
they
couldn't
find
victory
in
the
remaining
two
matches
and
placed
2nd
at
the
event.
Their
next
stop
was
at
the
Season
2
North
American
Regional
Finals
.
They
started
off
well
with
a
2-1
victory
against
Team
Legion
,
but
would
not
prevail
against
Dignitas
in
the
semifinals.
Facing
them
in
the
3rd
place
match
was
Curse
Gaming
.
CLG
Prime
would
go
on
to
win
two
games
in
row,
taking
3rd
place
and
qualifying
for
a
spot
in
the
Season
Two
World
Championship
.
Unfortunately
CLG
Prime
were
knocked
out
the
Championship
in
the
group
stage,
losing
to
Invictus
Gaming
and
Azubu
Frost
.
They,
however,
were
able
to
score
one
victory,
and
and
that
was
against
SK
Gaming
,
finishing
with
9th-10th
placement
at
the
tournament.
Voyboy
left
the
team
in
October,
and
two
months
later
LiNk
and
Aphromoo
joined.
In
January
2013
Bigfatlip
steps
down
to
be
sub
for
for
the
team
and
AZUBU
TV
sponsors
Counter
Logic
Gaming.
