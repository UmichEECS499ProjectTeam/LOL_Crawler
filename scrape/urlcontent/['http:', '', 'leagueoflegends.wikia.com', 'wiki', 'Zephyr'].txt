Efficiency
Zephyr
is
122%
gold
efficient
without
the
passive.
Strategy
The
lowest
base
movement
speed
in
the
game
is
325.
At
this
speed,
Zephyr
grants
32.5
movement
speed.
The
movement
speed
stat
only
increases
flat
movement
speed,
and
will
not
interact
with
other
percentage
increases.
Zephyr
is
an
excellent
choice
for
many
bruisers
and
fighters,
granting
them
the
movement
speed
and
Tenacity
to
stick
to
key
enemy
targets
while
supplementing
their
DPS.
Champions
with
powerful
on-hit
effects
can
use
Zephyr
's
attack
speed
boost
to
its
fullest,
such
as
Irelia's
Hiten
Style
or
Jax's
Grandmaster's
Might
.
Zephyr
is
useful
for
builds
that
rely
less
on
critical
strike
chance,
and
combines
well
with
the
Blade
of
the
Ruined
King
passive.
And
benefits
AD
scaling
abilities
better
than
Phantom
Dancer
.
Zephyr
is
one
of
the
new
Tenacity
items
added
in
the
Pre-Season
3
Patch
.
It
provides
players
more
freedom
in
their
choice
of
boots,
specifically
those
who
want
Tenacity
but
do
not
want
to
commit
to
Mercury's
Treads
for
it.
Zephyr
is
an
excellent
choice
for
AD
carries
who
have
a
fully
stacked
inventory
and
want
to
sell
Berserker's
Greaves
or
Mercury's
Treads
for
a
more
expensive
alternative.
