Trivia
The
word
"Shen"
literally
means
"God"
in
Chinese.
The
word
"慎"
(meaning
caution),
with
same
pronunciation,
is
used
on
Chinese
clients.
Shen
was
the
first
champion
in
League
of
Legends
to
use
energy
to
cast
his
abilities,
rather
than
mana
or
health
like
most
other
champions.
Shen
,
Zed
and
Jax
do
not
have
their
faces
revealed
in
any
of
their
skins.
Kennen's
Karate
&
M.D.
skins
and
Akali's
Soccer,
Nurse,
&
Blood
Moon
skins,
respectively,
reveal
their
faces.
Shen
was
designed
by
Guinsoo
.
[1]
Shen
is
voiced
by
Keith
Silverstein
.
[2]
Shen
was
one
of
the
champions
chosen
for
the
Ionian
pool
available
during
the
Ionia
vs.
Noxus
match
.
However,
he
was
the
ban
choice
by
Noxus.
Shen
carries
dual
Ninjatō
.
This
could
be
a
reference
to
Leonardo
from
Teenage
Mutant
Ninja
Turtles
who
wields
dual
ninjaken.
Both
are
leaders
of
their
teams
and
share
the
color
blue.
Shen
has
a
strong
resemblance
to
Joe
Musashi,
the
ninja
from
the
Sega
game
series
Shinobi.
The
two
ninjas
also
share
the
same
walk
animation
and
dash.
Shen's
Vorpal
Blade
ability
is
a
reference
to
Lewis
Carroll's
poem,
Jabberwocky.
Shen's
dance
bears
a
resemblance
to
the
martial
art
commonly
known
as
Tai
Chi
.
Shen
is
the
only
champion
that
can
heal
an
enemy,
using
Vorpal
Blade
.
Shen
along
with
Twisted
Fate
,
and
Pantheon
,
were
the
only
three
champions
to
have
global
teleporting
ultimates.
Following
changes
to
Twisted
Fate
and
Pantheon's
ultimates,
Shen's
was
the
only
one
to
retain
its
range,
leaving
Shen
with
the
only
global
teleport.
Quotes
"If
light
travels
so
fast,
how
come
it's
never
caught
a
ninja?"
is
a
direct
reference
to
the
Ask
A
Ninja
web
series.
You're
already
dead,
you
just
haven't
caught
up
yet.
is
a
reference
to
Kenshiro
from
the
Fist
of
the
North
Star
(
Hokuto
no
Ken
in
original
Japanese)
franchise.
Shen
shares
a
quote
with
Zed
:
"Without
a
sound."
Shen
shares
a
quote
with
Kennen
:
"From
the
shadows."
Shen's
quote:
"Tread
carefully."
is
similar
to
Akali
's
quote:
"Tread
lightly."
Skins
Yellow
Jacket
Shen
resembles
Scorpion
and
Frozen
Shen
resembles
Sub-Zero
from
the
Mortal
Kombat
franchise.
He
is
also
currently
the
only
champion
to
have
multiple
skins
that,
with
no
speculation
required,
reference
the
same
origin.
Surgeon
Shen
skin
is
a
possible
reference
to
The
Adventures
of
Dr.
McNinja
which
protagonist
is
a
ninja
who
decided
to
be
a
doctor.
Surgeon
Shen
,
Nurse
Akali
and
Kennen
M.D.
share
a
Medical
skin
theme.
Surgeon
Shen
was
proposed
by
the
community
In
the
Blood
Moon
Shen
skin,
he
wears
a
Hannya
Mask
to
cover
his
face,
making
him
the
"dark
spirit".
[3]
Blood
Moon
Shen
and
Blood
Moon
Akali
share
a
Blood

skin
theme.
The
masks
they
are
wearing
are
the
ones
used
in
the
Japanese
Noh
theater
.

related
to
"
Taipei
Assassins
",
who
have
won
the
League
of
Legends
Season
2
World
Championship
finals.
Warlord
Shen
may
be
a
reference
to
the
game
Shogun
2:
Total
War.
Many
highly-ranked
units
wear
helmets
and
robes
similar
to
the
one
Shen
is
wearing,
as
well
as
the
banner
on
his
back
resembling
the
generic
player
banner
from
the
game.

is
a
member
of
the
Kinkou
Order
along
with
Akali
and
Kennen
.
The
three
shadow
warriors
work
together
in
order
to
preserve
the
balance
in
Valoran
.

was
the
rival
of
Zed
a
former
disciple
of
the
Kinkou
Order
,
who
was
banished
after
he
used
forbidden
techniques
to
defeat
Shen.

later
returned

to
save
