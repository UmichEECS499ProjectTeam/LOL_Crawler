Ruby

is
a
basic

Cost
Analysis
Gold
Efficiency
Ruby
Crystal
is
the
item
from
which
the
health
gold
value
is
derived,
and
as
such,
it
derives
a
value
of
approximately
2.
67
gold
per
health
point.

Strategy
While
Ruby
Crystal
is
a
potential
starting
item,
Doran's
Shield
is
generally
preferred
for
the
health
regeneration
and
autoattack
mitigation
it
provides
in
lieu
of
Ruby
Crystal's
additional
70
health.
However,
Ruby
Crystal
does
have
the
advantage
of
building
into
a
myriad
of
useful
items,
while
Doran's
Shield
must
eventually
be
sold.
