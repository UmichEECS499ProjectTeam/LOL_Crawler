Runaan's
Hurricane
in
development
stage.
The
secondary
bolts
hit
enemy
units
within
375
range
of
your
attack's
primary
target
.
There
is
no
range
limit
between
your
champion
and
the
secondary
targets.
Secondary
bolts
do
not
prioritize
champions.
[2]
While
in
possession
of
Runaan's
Hurricane,
you
gain
a
small
floating
orb
that
accompanies
you
around
the
battlefield.
This
orb
fires
up
to
two
additional
missiles,
functioning
similar
to
Lulu's
Pix,
Faerie
Companion
.
The
passive
will
be
triggered
by
the
auto-attacks
of
any
champions
classified
as
ranged
.
This
is
an
attribute
applied
to
champions
that
is
independent
of
in-game
context,
such
as
proximity
to
the
target
or
a
specific
champion's
attack
animation.
Shapeshifting
champions
will
trigger
the
effect
while
in
ranged
form
only,
as
they
are
classified
as
melee
while
in
melee
form
and
the
orb
disappears
returning
when
they
switch
again.
Rengar's
Unseen
Predator
will
not
trigger
the
effect
despite
his
autoattacks
having
600/750
range,
as
Rengar
is
classified
as
melee.
Kayle
will
trigger
the
effect
while
Righteous
Fury
is
active
despite
her
attacks
having
no
projectile
themselves.
Runaan's
Hurricane
can
be
affected
by
blind
,
as
such
the
secondary
bolts
will
also
deal
no
damage.
This
item's
damage
scales
with
your
attack
damage
and
not
the
damage
dealt
by
your
attack.
As
such,
it
will
not
scale
with
Sheen
,
Spinning
Axe
or
critical
strikes
.
It
will
apply
life
steal
and
most
item
on-hit
effects
.
The
effect
does
not
apply
on
abilities
which
apply
on-hit
effects
.
'On
next
attack'
effects
will
only
be
applied
to
the
primary
target.
The
following
items
also
apply
to
secondary
targets:
Blade

Twitch's

Venom
Urgot's
Zaun-Touched
Bolt
Augmenter
and

Capacitor
Varus's
Blighted
Quiver
The
following
abilities
do
not
apply
to
secondary
targets:
Kayle's
Righteous
Fury
's
splash
will
not
trigger
as
it
is
not
classified
as
an
on-hit
effect
.
Vayne's
Silver
Bolts
will
only
apply
to
the
primary
target.
This
is
to
prevent
disabling
the
skill,
as
bolt
stacks
can
only
be
applied
to
a
single
target
at
any
given
time.
Lulu's
Pix,
Faerie
Companion
and
Sivir's
Ricochet
can
only
be
applied
to
a
single
target
at
any
one
time
because
of
the
way
it
is
programmed
to
fire
after
attacking.
Draven's
Spinning
Axe
will
only
apply
to
the
primary
target.
Miscellaneous
effects
that
also
apply
to
secondary
targets:
Blessing
of
the
Lizard
Elder
Spell
Weaving
Butcher
Arcane
Blade
Block
Bandit
Twitch
will
still
trigger
the
effect
while
Spray
and
Pray
is
active.
The
two
missiles
fired
are
unaffected
by
the
ability,
and
remain
single
target,
targeted
missiles.
As
such,
it
is
possible
for
an
enemy
to
be
damaged
by
both
Twitch's
pass-through
attacks
and
this
item.
Attacking
turrets
will
not
trigger
the
effect.

Trivia
Because
of
the
name
of
the
thread
Riot
revealed
this
item
in,
it
is
often
referred
to
as
"The
Storm".
Runaan's
Hurricane
is
named
after
RiotRunaan
,
an
Associate
Creative
Designer
at
Riot
Games.
The
orb
that
fires
the
2
bolts
and
floats
around
the
champion
it's
equipped
to
is
most
likely
a
reference
to
a
similar
power
up
in
the
Gradius
games.
The
item
may
have
been
inspired
by
the
alpha/beta
item
"
Hurricane
",
which
was
also
a
bow,
though
Hurricane's
Alpha
effect
is
unknown.

Yep,
just

it
in-game.
