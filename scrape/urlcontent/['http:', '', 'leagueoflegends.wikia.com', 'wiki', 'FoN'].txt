Trivia
The
1.75%
regeneration
was
displayed
as
part
of
the
champion's
health
regen.
Hovering
over
the
item's
icon
would
also
display
how
much
bonus
health
regeneration
it
provided.
Force
of
Nature
was
the
only
item
to
provide
movement
speed
,
magic
resistance
,
and
health
regeneration
.
The
item
was
removed
because
the
stats
it
gave
didn't
synergize
with
each
other,
and
it
provided
too
much
magic
resistance
in
one
item.
The
passive
was
given
to
Warmog's
Armor
and
Spirit
Visage
was
given
more
magic
resist
to
serve
as
a
different
end-game
MR
item.
