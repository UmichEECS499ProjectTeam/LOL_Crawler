PVP.net
version
1.03.11
LeaverBuster
additions
to
PVP.net:
Leave
Forgiveness
-
when
other
players
view
your
profile
or
summoner
information,
the
actual
total
of
leaves
will
only
be
displayed
if
it
is
outside
of
the
leave
forgiveness
threshold.
This
will
still
allow
players
to
identify
chronic
leavers,
but
will
not
punish
players
who
accidentally
leave.
Automatic
requeueing
–
while
in
champion
select,
if
another
summoner
leaves
the
game,
all
other
players
will
be
placed
back
into
the
matchmaking
queue
with
the
same
settings
they
had
previously
selected.
This
also
works
for
arranged
teams
unless
the
leaver
was
a
part
of
the
team.
Fixed
an
issue
that
was
causing
IP
to
not
update
in
the
store
for
some
players.
Fixed
an
error
that
was
causing
PVP.net
to
not
restore
after
the
completion
of
a
game
in
some
instances.
Fixed
a
bug
with
masteries
that
allowed
users
to
bypass
prerequisites
in
some
situations.
