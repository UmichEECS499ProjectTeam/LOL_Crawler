As
the
mightiest
warrior
to
ever
emerge
from
the
Minotaur
tribes
of
the
Great
Barrier
,
Alistar
defended
his
tribe
from
Valoran's
many
dangers;
that
is,
until
the
coming
of
the
Noxian
army.
Alistar
was
lured
from
his
village
by
the
machinations
of
Keiran
Darkwill,
General
Boram
Darkwill's
youngest
son,
and
commander
of
the
Noxian
expeditionary
force.
When
Alistar
returned,
he
found
his
village
burning
and
his
family
slain.
Bellowing
with
rage,
he
charged
an
entire
regiment
of
Noxus's
elite,
slaughtering
them
by
the
hundreds.
Only
the
intervention
of
some
of
Noxus's
most
skilled
summoners
checked
Alistar's
rage.
Brought
in
chains
to
Noxus,
Alistar
spent
the
intervening
years
as
a
gladiator
in
the
Fleshing,
pitted
in
endless
battle
for
the
entertainment
of
Noxus's
wealthy
leaders.
Alistar's
once
noble
soul
slowly
became
twisted,
and
he
would
have
been
driven
to
insanity
if
not
for
Ayelia,
a
young
servant
girl
who
befriended
him
and
eventually
arranged
for
his
escape.
Suddenly
free,
Alistar
joined
the
newly
formed
League
of
Legends
to
fight
as
a
champion
,
hoping
to
one
day
exact
his
final
vengeance
upon
Noxus
and
find
the
girl
who
had
renewed
his
hope.
Initially
unwilling
to
cater
to
his
celebrity
status
as
a
champion,
Alistar
has
since
discovered
that
there
is
power
in
fame,
and
he
has
become
a
vocal
advocate
for
those
whom
the
Noxian
government
treads
upon.
He
also
calls
to
light
things
that
the
Noxian
military
would
prefer
remain
hidden
--
something
that
has
made
him
very
unpopular
with
Noxus's
nobles.
His
charitable
work
has
earned
him
several
philanthropic
awards,
which
serve
as
an
interesting
contrast
to
the
rage
and
destruction
he
brings
to
the
League
of
Legends.
"If
you
intend
to
grab
the
bull
by
the
horns
as
a
summoner,
Alistar
might
have
something
to
say
about
that."
