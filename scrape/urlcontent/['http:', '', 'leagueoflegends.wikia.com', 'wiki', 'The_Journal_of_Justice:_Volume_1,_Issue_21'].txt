Kassadin
and
Malzahar
Found
Fighting
Again
Karthus
caught
in
the
crossfire
Quinton
Groat
reporting
from
the
Institute
of
War
Kassadin
and
Malzahar
were
arrested
by
League
Adjudicators
yesterday
evening
when
they
were
discovered
battling
in
the
mountains
outside
the
Institute
of
War
.
The
Deathsinger,
Karthus
,
was
found
“dead”
at
the
scene,
although
League
mages
were
able
to
revive
him,
since
he
was
not
technically
alive
to
begin
with.
League
officials
have
stated
that
the
situation
is
completely
under
control,
and
while
they
will
not
be
removing
any
champions
from
their
roster,
“[the
offending
champions]
will
be
punished
accordingly.”
League
sages
were
alerted
to
the
situation
when
Kog'Maw
fled
the
Institute,
wailing.
“Kog’Maw
is
supervised
at
all
times
for
the
protection
of
Runeterrans
,”
League
High
Councilor,
Heywan
Relivash,
explained
in
an
emergency
press
assembly,
“Our
Adjudicators
were
prepared
to
suppress
him,
but
he
displayed
no
aggressive
behavior,
nor
any
visible
objection
to
their
presence.
Since
Kog’Maw’s
origins
are
a
matter
of
great
interest,
the
Adjudicators
were
instructed
to
observe
and
only
interfere
if
necessary.”
“We
are
uncertain
whether
Kog’Maw
was
beckoned
by
Malzahar
or
whether
he
was
simply
aware
that
Malzahar
was
in
trouble,
but
he
led
the
Adjudicators
straight
to
the
scene
of
the
incident.
There
they
found
Karthus
prone,
victim
to
powerful
magical
assault,
while
Kassadin
and
Malzahar
remained
engaged
in
combat.
The
Adjudicators
were
able
to
isolate
and
subdue
both
champions
within
minutes,
testament
to
their
abilities.”
“Rest
assured,
we
are
not
taking
this
matter
lightly.
These
two
have
a
history
of
disagreement,
which
is
not
unusual
for
League
champions,
but
violence
between
League
champions
off
the
Fields
of
Justice
is
unacceptable.
I
am
well-aware
that
the
decision
to
retain
them
as
champions
is
controversial
and
confusing,
but
we
have
very
good,
very
confidential
reasons
for
proceeding
this
way
and
our
decision
is
final.”
Heywan
did
not
disclose
any
further
information.
As
though
things
weren’t
troubling
enough,
before
the
press
assembly
even
took
place,
activists
were
somehow
alerted
and
hundreds
of
protestors
gathered
outside
the
Institute,
comprised
of
both
denouncers
and
self-proclaimed
followers
of
the
Void
alike.
In
response,
a
phalanx
of
summoners
and
Adjudicators
was
mobilized
to
disperse
the
mobs.
No
violence
broke
out,
although
several
protestors
were
arrested
for
refusing
to
cooperate.
Karthus’
inexplicable
presence
at
the
scene
of
the
crime
remains
a
mystery,
as
well
as
which
(if
either)
of
the
champions
attacked
him.
One
source
who
was
able
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
him
as
he
was
transported
back
for
supervision
claimed
to
overhear
him
talking
about
“protecting
the
inhibitor,”
although
according
to
the
source,
he
seemed
to
be
referring
to
something
other
than
the
inhibitors
on
the
Fields
of
Justice.
Night-Prowling
Beast
Slain
in
Askay
Night-Prowling
Beast
Slain
in
Askay
Henril
Dreving
reporting
from
Askay
The
people
of
Askay,
a
village
under
Noxian
jurisdiction
since
last
year,
are
paying
their
respects
to
a
Demacian
after
the
famed
Night
Hunter
fought
and
killed
a
mordicant
that
had
plagued
them
for
weeks.
Following
several
nights
spent
in
futile
attempt
to
combat
the
creature,
the
villagers
sent
word
to
Noxus
for
aid.
However,
by
the
time
Noxian
forces
arrived,
they
found
the
beast
they'd
come
for
already
dead
and
defeated
by
the
elusive
Night
Hunter
herself.
The
mordicant,
a
rare
creature
native
to
the
Ironspine
Mountain
region,
made
its
first
appearance
last
week,
slaughtering
livestock
in
Askay's
outlying
farms
and
viciously
attacking
anyone
who
came
near
it.
Mordicants
bear
a
unique
magical
ability:
their
speed
is
amplified
in
darkness.
According
to
the
villagers
of
Askay,
this
ability
made
combating
the
beast
upon
its
nocturnal
appearances
near
impossible.
"It
was
faster
than
anything
I've
ever
seen,"
said
one
of
Askay's
night
watchmen.
"Couldn't
land
anything
on
it,
and
it
wouldn't
leave
until
the
first
light
of
dawn."
Askay
requested
Noxian
aid,
but
with
Noxus'
forces
so
heavily
occupied
in
Kalamanda
,
the
response
was
delayed.
Yesterday
morning,
however,
citizens
of
Askay
awoke
to
find
their
trouble
solved.
"My
men
and
I
were
ready
for
a
fight
all
night
long,
but
the
beast
didn't
come."
"We
figured
it
was
just
a
lucky
break,
but
when
I
made
my
rounds
once
the
sun
came
up,
I
found
the
thing
dead,
pinned
to
the
wall
of
Tarill's
barn
by
a
massive
bolt.
But
there
was
nobody
around."
The
night
watchmen
of
Askay
reportedly
discovered
a
note
bolted
to
the
beast's
body
as
well,
bearing
the
symbol
of
the
Night
Hunter
and
a
short
message:
"Every
dark
beast
has
a
master."
Noxian
forces
arrived
late
afternoon
to
find
the
beast
they'd
been
sent
to
fight
dead
on
display
in
Askay's
village
square.
"The
people
of
Askay
may
be
safe
for
now,"
said
Captain
Cynlan
Thralk,
commander
of
the
Noxian
unit,
"but
know
that
this
village
remains
under
the
protective
wing
of
Noxus,
and
we
have
no
need
of
further
interference
in
our
affairs."
'The
Night
Hunter'
is
not
an
unfamiliar
moniker
in
Valoran.
Rumored
to
be
a
Demacian
woman
of
noble
descent,
she
has
been
credited
with
many
similar
events
throughout
recent
years.
Incident
records
at
the
Institute
of
War
connect
The
Night
Hunter
to
the
deaths
of
several
rogue
summoners
practicing
dark
magic
in
Demacia.
Following
the
incident,
Captain
Thralk
stated
his
unit
would
remain
in
Askay,
claiming,
"We
can't
be
sure
that
this
is
over,
and
it
would
be
foolish
to
leave
Askay's
continued
safety
to
the
whim
of
a
Demacian
vigilante."
Inside
the
Vault
A
peek
at
the
Arcanum
Majoris’
most
coveted
treasures
Reira
Kashuld
reporting
from
the
Institute
of
War
The
greatest
dream
of
any
artificer
would
be
to
glimpse
the
wonders
that
lay
behind
the
negatron
reinforced
doors
of
the
“Summoner’s
Vault”
in
the
Arcanum
Majoris.
This
vault
holds
the
original
artifacts
all
summoners
are
familiar
with,
as
their
duplicates
are
wielded
daily
by
champions
on
the
Fields
of
Justice.
Normally,
the
Vault
is
completely
off-limits
to
anyone
but
the
most
distinguished
scholars
of
the
Arcanum.
However,
a
friend
of
mine,
Artificer
Ceisa
Kashuld,
managed
to
attain
special
permission
for
me
to
tour
the
facilities
last
week.
This
was
an
extremely
rare
treat,
especially
since
security
has
been
so
tight
after
the
theft
of
Zhonya's
Ring
.
My
guide
was
League
Artificer
Ramune
Numer,
a
sophisticated
man
who
had
an
odd
habit
of
adjusting
his
monocle
whenever
he
made
a
point.
As
we
passed
the
main
security
checkpoint,
Ramune
showed
me
the
workshop
where
they
perform
artifact
inspections.
“We
are
always
researching
new
crafting
techniques
here
at
the
Arcanum
Majoris,”
Ramune
said,
adjusting
his
monocle,
“While
we
do
produce
many
original
pieces,
supporters
of
the
League
often
donate
artifacts
to
us.”
Three
artifacts
currently
in
testing
were
laid
out
upon
a
table:
a
phoenix-hilted
sword
;
a
heart-shaped
crystal
;
and
a
glowing
cloak,
complete
with
dagger
.
Ramune
explained
that
these
items
were
in
their
final
stages
of
safety
testing.
“The
unique
aspect
of
these
items
is
that
they
are
augmented
with
a
special
resonating
crystal
called
Sarlace.”
“When
refined,
Sarlace
produces
an
energy
resonance
that
improves
the
mental
and
physical
balance
of
anyone
who
wields
it."
"The
only
League
artifacts
that
currently
utilize
this
material
are
Mercury
Treads
,
as
the
material
is
extremely
volatile
and
can
lose
stability
quite
explosively
in
the
refining
process.”
“These
two
were
donated,”
Ramune
said,
indicating
the
sword
and
gem,
“I
can’t
go
into
much
detail
about
the
effects
of
these
items
until
they
have
been
cleared
for
use
on
the
Fields
of
Justice.
Although,”
He
hefted
the
cloak
and
dagger
proudly,
“I
will
say
that
these
were
made
here
at
the
Institute.
When
the
two
pieces
are
held
simultaneously,
their
power
amplifies.
We
call
this
method
of
manufacture
‘symbiotic
fabrication.’
It’s
the
same
crafting
method
used
with
Phantom
Dancers
.”
The
tour
continued
to
the
Vault.
It
was
massive!
Words
cannot
begin
to
describe
the
variety
of
artifacts
within.
At
the
very
front
were
the
artifacts
currently
in
commission,
all
organized
on
ornate
shelves
and
racks.
As
we
ventured
further,
we
came
upon
artifacts
I’ve
never
seen,
as
well
as
some
I
hadn’t
seen
in
a
long
time.
It
was
there
that
I
saw
the
Sage's
Ring
,
my
old
friend.
Nostalgia
swept
over
me.
I
asked
why
the
artifact
was
decommissioned.
“It
wasn’t
very
popular
and
replicating
costs
were
high.
Sapphire
Crystal
s
were
far
more
efficient.”
I
was
asked
not
to
speak
about
any
of
the
other
items
I
was
given
the
privilege
to
view,
but
I
can
say
that
one
after
another,
they
took
my
breath
away.
I
can
understand
both
why
the
Vault
is
kept
so
carefully
guarded,
as
well
as
why
the
Arcanum
is
known
as
the
foremost
authority
on
magic.
I
don’t
know
if
I’ll
ever
have
the
opportunity
to
peek
behind
the
heavy
Vault
doors
again,
but
I
know
for
certain
that
I
will
remember
that
day
forever!

Senior
Summoner
Ralston
Farnsley
commenting
from
the
Institute
of
War
The
League’s
limits
have
been
tested
quite
a
lot
lately.
As
someone
with
insight
into
the
capabilities
of
the
men
and
women
who
the
League
employs,
I
have
to
say
that
this
is
very
foolish.
The
League
does
its
best
to
allow
Runeterrans
the
freedom
to
live
as
they
please
so
long
as
they
do
not
endanger
those
around
them.
This
should
not
be
mistaken
for
weakness.
"I
have
often
wondered
how
unaffiliated
champions
fight
within
the
League.
It’s
obvious
that
Katarina
Du
Couteau
fights
for
Noxus
and
Garen
fights
as
the
might
of
Demacia,
but
how
do
champions
such
as
Veigar
,
whose
goal
is
"bring
all
of
the
city-states
to
their
knees,
regardless
of
affiliation"
fight
for
the
political
gain
of
a
nation
within
the
League?
Are
champions
such
as
Fiddlesticks
,
Shaco
,
and
Mordekaiser
sold
to
the
highest
bidder
or
does
each
nation
draft
them
before
a
round
commences,
and
said
champion
is
expected
to
oblige?
If
this
is
the
case
is
it
possible
for
a
champion
like
Sion
to
be
selected
to
fight
for
Demacian
gain?"
–
RemedialHappyMan
Well
asked,
RemedialHappyMan.
As
you
know,
the
League
holds
regular
matches
which
are
not
meant
to
resolve
any
political
disputes.
These
are
both
to
train
summoners
as
well
as
to
provide
the
entire
world
with
the
spectacle
of
battle
that
has
replaced
open
conflict.
Champions
are
given
the
option
to
declare
allegiances
when
they
join
the
League,
and
no
champion
may
ever
be
summoned
in
a
political
match
against
his
or
her
will.
This
said,
when
political
matches
do
occur,
unaffiliated
champions
are
sometimes
approached
by
city-states
for
representation,
and
they
are
generally
welcome
to
accept.
Also,
the
League
seeks
out
those
with
the
power
to
become
champions
to
bolster
the
strength
of
its
competitors,
so
some
unaffiliated
champions
are
present
despite
having
no
political
intentions
whatsoever.
"For
some
time
I've
wondered
about
the
pre-League
lives
of
many
champions.
Many
times
I've
summoned
The
Armordillo,
Rammus
,
and
every
time
I
get
a
glimpse
that
there's
something
more
underneath
that
spiny
shell
than
he's
letting
on.
In
his
travels
he's
covered
quite
a
bit
of
distance
and
met
many
peoples,
I
wonder
if
he
is
in
fact
fluent
in
several
languages
as
he
can
clearly
understand
them."
–
Summoner
Moepasaurus
Rammus
is
one
of
the
most
soft-spoken
of
the
brave
warriors
in
the
League.
He
has
evolved
from
a
state
that
perhaps
only
Twitch
truly
comprehends.
In
the
process,
he
has
taken
the
approach
of
a
silent
observer
almost
without
exception,
growing
and
learning
constantly.
I
must
say,
from
my
experiences
with
him,
he
seems
exceptionally
wise
even
though
or
perhaps
because
he
is
a
being
of
so
few
words.
He
values
his
privacy
immensely,
but
I
decided
I
would
approach
him
to
see
if
he
would
accept
an
interview,
just
for
you.
I’ve
transcribed
the
exchange
in
exact
detail.
“Okay.”
“Why
is
it
that
whenever
I
summon
a
champion
for
a
fresh
bout
on
the
fields,
they
must
be
retrained?
It
seems
odd
to
me
that
General
Swain
would
forget
how
to
summon
his
Ravenous
Flock
or
Headsman
Urgot
how
to
calibrate
his
Hyper-Kinetic
Position
Reverser
in
each
and
every
bout
I
enter
when
they
were
such
terrors
with
them
just
the
last
match.
Is
it
some
matter
of
attunement
between
champion
and
summoner?”
–
Mädchen,
Summoner
of
Noxus
You’ve
hit
the
nail
on
the
head,
Mädchen.
The
link
between
the
champion
and
summoner
essentially
creates
a
“new
being”,
comprised
in
part
of
both
of
them.
In
the
same
way
it
might
take
some
time
for
you
and
a
partner
to
get
the
rhythm
of
running
if
one
of
each
of
your
legs
was
tied
to
the
other’s,
so
too
must
the
summoned
being
learn
to
utilize
the
power
within
it.
When
the
link
is
severed,
both
champion
and
summoner
must
“decompress”
from
the
ordeal,
settling
back
into
their
bodies.
This
removes
the
understanding
they
both
had,
which
is
why
the
same
summoner
and
champion
must
relearn
their
abilities
again
in
the
next
match.
