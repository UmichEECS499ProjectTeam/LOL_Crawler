generate
1
stack
of
Headshot.
At
7
/
6
/
5
stacks,
her
next
basic
attack
will
deal
bonus
physical
damage
equal
to
50%
of
her
attack
damage
.
The
bonus
damage
is
tripled
against
minions
and
monsters.
Attacks
from
brush
will
grant
2
stacks
of
Headshot.
Attacks
against
towers
will
not
grant
any
stacks.
Ability
Details
Headshot
is
a
single-use
on-hit
effect
.
The
triggering
attack
will
apply
other
on-hit
effects
and
can
critically
strike
as
normal.
As
with
most
on-hit
physical
damage,
the
bonus
damage
from
Headshot
will
apply
life
steal
.
Critical
strikes
will
not
interact
with
Headshot's
bonus
damage.
The
empowered
attack
will
not
be
consumed
on
attacks
against
wards
and
structures.
The
empowered
attack
will
be
wasted
if
Caitlyn's
attack
is
dodged
,
blocked
,
parried
,
or
if
the
attack
misses
.
Additional
Information:
Runaan's
Hurricane
will
generate
stacks
for
every
enemy
hit.
However,
as
with
all
one-use
on-hit
effects,
the
bonus
damage
will
only
apply
to
the
primary
target.

Unlike
similar

Arcane

,

short
channel
rather

Range:

Cooldown:

Cost:

mana
Active:
After
a
brief
delay,
Caitlyn
locks
onto
a
target
enemy
champion
and
channels
for
1
second.
While
channeling,
Caitlyn
gains
true
sight
of
the
target.
If
Caitlyn
completes
the
channel,
she
will
fire
a
3200-speed
homing
projectile
toward
the
target
that
deals
physical
damage
to
the
first
enemy
champion
it
hits.
Physical
damage:
250
/
475
/
700
(+
200%
bonus
AD)
Ability
Details
Ace
in
the
Hole
is
a
single-target
homing
missile
that
collides
with
the
first
enemy
champion
in
its
path.
Additional
Information:
If
Caitlyn
loses
sight
of
her
target
before
she
locks
on,
the
skill
cancel.
It
is
not
put
on
cooldown
nor
will
it
consume
any
mana.
Ace
in
the
Hole
grants
true
sight
of
the
target
while
locked
on,
and
becoming
stealthed
during
the
channel
will
have
no
effect.
The
missile
will
follow
and
can
still
hit
stealthed
champions,
effectively
revealing
their
position.
Clones
will
intercept
the
missile,
as
they
are
classified
as
champions
for
targeting
purposes.
Once
Caitlyn
has
started
channeling,
she
is
unable
to
cancel
the
ability
herself.
This
is
unlike
many
other
channeled
abilities,
such
as
Malzahar's
Nether
Grasp
,
which
can
be
canceled
by
commanding
Malzahar
to
move.
If
the
target
dies
or
becomes
untargetable
during
the
channel,
Ace
in
the
Hole
will
be
canceled
and
put
on
a
5
second
cooldown.
This
will
not
refund
the
mana
cost.
If
the
target
dies
after
the
bullet
has
been
fired,
it
will
continue
toward
their
corpse
and
can
still
be
intercepted.
The
ability
will
go
on
full
cooldown.
The
missile
will
continue
to
follow
untargetable
champions,
but
will
fizzle
upon
reaching
them
unless
they
become
targetable
before
it
would
hit.
