A
capture
point
is
an
area
in
the
game
mode,
Dominion
.
In
Crystal
Scar
,
there
are
5
capture
points.
The
capture
points
are
located
across
the
Crystal
Scar
and
are
the
main
objective
of
the
game.
The
teams
must
compete
for
control
over
them.
They
act
very
much
like
a
turret
except
they
do
lower
damage
and
can
be
prevented
from
attacking.
They
can
have
one
of
three
states,
either
blue,
purple,
or
neutral,
however
the
color
of
the
teams
is
not
shown.
Minions
can
take
control
of
a
capture
point
by
attacking
it,
however
it
will
still
attack.
Stealthed
champions
or
wards
will
be
revealed
near
neutral
or
enemy
capture
points.
An
allied
capture
point
will
attack
enemy
units
like
a
turret
,
but
the
attack
damage
is
weaker
than
the
one
in
the
classic
mode,
and
will
stop
attacking
when
being
neutralized
by
the
enemy
champion.
This
creates
an
opportunity
for
attackers
to
push
defenders
out
from
under
the
tower
without
taking
tower
damage.

Basis
Capture
points
represent
important
strategic
locations
across
the
map.
The
five
points
are
laid
out
in
the
outer
lane,
which
is
a
circular
circuit
with
several
points
of
entrance
from
the
inner
map
and
each
team
re-spawn
area.
The
outer
lane
and
the
control
points
are
permanently
revealed
to
both
teams
at
all
times,
regardless
of
who
controls
the
points.
Controlling
these
points
and
defending
them
against
the
opposition
is
the
central
focus
of
Dominion.
When
the
capture
point
is
not
being
channeled,
it
will
slowly
restore
to
its
current
state.
Capture
points
do
have
a
buff
similar
to
Triumphant
Roar
.
Ownership
Players
can
claim
capture
points
by
right
clicking
the
capture
point
tower
when
their
champion
is
within
range.
After
a
short
channel
time,
ownership
of
the
capture
point
will
transfer
to
the
capturing
player’s
team.
Minions
will
automatically
start
capturing
once
they
are
within
the
capture
point
territory,
and
the
process
gradually
drains
its
health
instead
of
channeling.
If
a
capturing
champion
moves,
takes
damage
from
an
enemy
champion,
or
if
an
enemy
champion
initiates
his
or
her
own
capture
during
the
channel
time,
the
channeling
will
be
canceled
and
a
short
cool-down
period
prohibits
the
capturing
champion
from
attempting
another
capture.
In
the
case
that
it
is
not
fully
neutralized
or
captured,
if
not
being
captured
by
minions
or
champions,
it
will
slowly
drain
to
the
last
state
it
was
in.
If
the
point
has
not
been
fully
captured
from
neutral,
it
will
not
attack
any
units.
The
summoner
spell
Garrison
can
enhance
or
weaken
one
capture
point
temporarily.
A
point
allied
to
the
caster
is
enhanced,
and
an
enemy
point
is
weakened.
Neutralization
Points
controlled
by
the
opposing
team
will
take
longer
to
capture,
since
they
must
first
be
neutralized
before
you
can
assume
control.
Since
minion
attacks
do
not
cancel
the
channeling,
and
you
know
all
enemy
champions
are
far
away
and
your
HP
does
not
hit
rock
bottom,
you
can
safely
start
neutralizing
under
enemy
minions'
attack.
However,
if
the
champion
can
kill
a
group
of
minions
quickly,
it
is
preferable
to
wipe
them
out
first,
because
the
presence
of
enemy
minions
at
the
capture
point
territory
will
slow
the
player's
channeling
progress.
There
is
no
way
to
interrupt
a
minion's
neutralization
or
capturing,
except
by
killing
them
or
waiting
until
they
die
from
capturing.
Also,
minions
will
gain
a
buff
called
'Capture
Fervor'
increasing
their
armor/magic
resistance
while
capturing.
To
change
the
alignment
of
a
capture
point
from
enemy
to
neutral
or
neutral
to
allied
with
a
single
champion
takes
10
seconds.
Likewise
for
a
single
champion
to
bring
a
turret
at
full
enemy
alignment
to
his
or
her
own,
it
takes
twice
as
long.
The
more
champions
and
minions,
particularly
the
anti-turret
cannon
,
join
in
on
the
channeling,
the
faster
the
progress
will
be,
though
with
diminishing
returns
for
each
additional
champion
[diminished
by
how
much?]
.
Likewise,
the
presence
of
enemy
minions
at
a
capture
point
will
slow
down
the
capture
rate.
Minions
There
are
two
minion
spawn
points
behind
each
capture
point.
Once
the
capture
point
is
under
a
player's
control
and
the
neighboring
capture
point
belongs
to
an
enemy,
they
will
spawn
minion
waves
(two
regular
minions
plus
one
super
minion
at
the
beginning,
three
regular
plus
one
super
later)
to
attack
enemy
minion
waves
or
capture
the
capture
point
once
they
arrive.
If
the
minion
has
arrived
at
the
allied
capture
point
without
an
enemy
around,
they
will
increase
control
of
the
point
if
able
then
simply
die
at
the
destination.
Minions,
in
addition
to
their
natural
base
stats
increase
over
time
(attack
damage,
armor,
magic
resist),
will
also
gain
small
bonuses
depending
on
the
number
of
capture
points
currently
held
(
needs
confirmation
/
testing
)
If
you
are
capturing
an
enemy
capture
point,
nearby
minions
will
lose
health
and
receive
a
buff
called
'Capture
Flavor'.
Enemy
minions
will
be
forced
to
attack
the
point
due
to
taunt
and
lose
health
every
second.
Capture
Points
on
Map
Five
capture
points
are
situated
alongside
the
outer
circuit
evenly.
They
are
classified
as
"top"
(Windmill),
"middle"
(Refinery
and
Drill)
and
"bottom"
(Quarry
and
Boneyard)
according
to
their
latitudinal
position.
Clock
position
is
also
used
by
some
players
to
indicate
the
position
of
each
capture
point:
12
o'clock
(Windmill),
2
o'clock
(Drill),
5
o'clock
(Boneyard),
7
o'clock
(Quarry)
and
10
o'clock
(Refinery).
In
the
current
play
style,
bottom
capture
points
are
laned
by
one
champion
against
another
one
of
the
opposing
team.
This
role
is
usually
assigned
to
the
champion
with
best
defensive
and
pushing
attributes.
One
or
two
champions
may
capture
the
nearest
middle
capture
point
then
rush
up
to
the
top
to
assist
the
remaining
champions
who
have
headed
straight
there.
Because
the
top/Windmill
is
the
furthest
capture
point
to
either
champion
re-spawn
points,
making
it
difficult
for
newly
re-spawned
champion
to
defend
it
when
it
is
under
attack.

The
Windmill
The
Windmill
Located
in
the
northern
part
of
Kalamanda,
the
Windmill
is
the
nerve
center
of
the
mining
village.
Wind
and
magic
fuel
the
Windmill
as
it
generates
power
to
refine
the
raw
materials
mined
from
the
village.
Equally
distant
from
each
team’s
starting
location,
the
Windmill
will
be
a
constant
point
of
contention.
The
Drill
The
Drill
Surveying
of
Kalamanda’s
northeastern
section
was
well
underway
when
fighting
broke
out
between
Demacia
and
Noxus.
Giant
drills
and
open
pits
dot
the
landscape
in
this
key
capture
location.
Purple
starts
the
battle
closer
to
the
Drill,
but
must
be
on
the
lookout
for
sneak
attacks
by
Blue
if
they
are
to
maintain
control
as
the
speed
shrines
are
adjacent
to
the
Drill
(likewise
for
the
Quarry.
The
Quarry
The
Quarry
The
largest
deposits
of
precious
resources
are
located
in
the
Quarry
along
the
southwestern
edge
of
Kalamanda.
Closer
to
Blue’s
starting
position,
this
capture
point
resides
next
to
a
large
techmaturgical
mining
device
that
local
villagers
referred
to
as
“The
Claw”.
The
Boneyard
The
Boneyard
During
the
initial
mining
effort
the
skeleton
of
an
ancient
worm
–
one
far
larger
than
even
the
mighty
Baron
Nashor
–
was
uncovered
in
the
southeastern
portion
of
Kalamanda.
Its
proximity
to
Purple’s
starting
position
will
make
this
capture
point
easier
for
them
to
defend
initially,
though
Blue
will
always
be
looking
for
an
opportunity
to
seize
control.
The
Refinery
The
Refinery
The
northwestern
part
of
Kalamanda
houses
all
the
refining
structures
used
to
extract
magic
and
precious
resources
from
the
raw
materials
unearthed
in
the
village.
The
Blue
team
has
the
early
advantage
in
securing
this
point,
but
they
must
remain
constantly
watchful
for
potential
sabotage
by
Purple.
