to
change
stance.
The
previous
aura
persists
for
1
more
second
after
Sona
enters
a
different
stance.

Ability
Details
Power
Chord
is
a
one-use
on-hit
effect
that
triggers
periodically.
The
triggering
attack
will
apply
other
on-hit
effects
and
can
critically
strike
as
normal.
Power
Chord's
bonus
damage
will
go
through
dodge
and
parry
,
while
the
triggering
attack
will
be
mitigated.
The
entire
damage

blind
.
Magic
damage
will
be
mitigated
by
Black
Shield
and
Lifeline
.
Spell
shields
will
block
the
attack.
Additional
Information:
When
Power
Chord
is
ready,
Sona
gains
a
ring
around
her.
This
ring
will
have
a
different
color
depending
on
the
last
ability
used
(blue,
green
or
purple).
The
effect
does
not
change
if
abilities
are
used
while
the
projectile
is
in
motion.
If
Power
Chord
reaches
its
third
charge
using
Crescendo,
its
effect
will
be
that
of
the
active
aura
at
that
time,
or
that
of
whichever
ability
Sona
uses
thereafter.
If
no
song
is
playing
when
Power
Chord
is
ready,
it
will
have
no
effect
and
the
buff
is
consumed
after
the
next
autoattack.
Sona's
auras
will
only
affect
allied
champions,
not
minions
or
pets
.
Power
Chord
affects
turrets
,
inhibitors
,
and
the
nexus
,
but
Diminuendo's
damage
debuff
does
not.
Power
Chord
resets
Sona's
attack
timer
when
it
is
ready.
