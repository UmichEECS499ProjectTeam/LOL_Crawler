is
a
point
blank
area
of
effect
ability.
Area
of
Effect:
~1400
Additional
Information:
When

It
is
not

duration
of
the
ability's
cooldown.
Raise
Morale's

is
not
an
aura,
and
allies

near
Gangplank
after
the
skill
is
used
will
not
receive
the
buff.
Likewise
allies
will
keep
the
buff

dies
or
they
move
away
from
him.

to
fire
a
cannonball
barrage
upon
a
target
600-radius

of
the
area
and
slowing
enemies
inside

by
25%.
25
cannonballs
randomly
drop
over
the
duration,
each
one
dealing
magic
damage
to
enemies
within
a
radius
of
150.

Ability
Details
Cannon
Barrage
is
a
global
ground
targeted
area
of
effect
ability.
Every
0.3
seconds
a
cannonball
falls
in
a
smaller
area
of
effect
within
the
marked
location,
dealing
magic
damage
to
enemy
units
at
that
point.
Area
of
Effect:
~575
Cannonball
Area
of
Effect:
~275
Applies
spell
effects
as
an
area
of
effect
ability.
Spell
vamp
is
reduced
to
one-third
effectiveness.
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
will
apply
a
15%
slow.
Magic
damage
will
be
mitigated
by
Black
Shield
and
Lifeline
.
Spell
shields
will
block
the
damage
of
one
cannonball.
Additional
Information:
Cannon
Barrage
grants
vision
of
the
targeted
area
to
Gangplank's
team
for
the
duration.
Cannon
Barrage
can
damage
targets
outside
the
displayed
killzone.
While
the
cannonballs'
AoE
center
is
always
within
the
displayed
killzone,
their
radius
can
extend
beyond
it.
Since
the
slow
and
damage
parts
of
the
ability
are
separate
though,
targets
damaged
like
this
will
not
be
slowed.
Slows
will
linger
for
0.25
seconds
after
leaving
the
marked
area.
Hit-Box
size
plays
an
important
role
during
Cannon
Barrage.
Targets
with
smaller
hitboxes
(like
minions
or
Teemo
)
are
statistically
less
likely
to
get
hit
from
a
cannonball
and
are
therefore
likely
to
take
less
damage.
Targets
with
larger
hitboxes
(like
Cho'Gath
)
are
likely
to
get
hit
with
more
cannonballs
and
take
more
damage.
Cho'Gath
with
6
stacks
of
Feast
and
2
other
enlarging
buffs
(
Wild
Growth
and
Storm
Shield
)
will
be
big
enough
to
get
damaged
from
every
single
cannonball
if
he
is
in
the
dead
center
of
the
ability.
