Armor
penetration
is
a
champion
statistic
that
allows
the
champion
to
ignore
some
or
all
of
a
target's
armor
.
All
champions
have
0
base
armor
penetration
but
can
increase
it
with
items
,
runes
,
masteries
and
some
champion
abilities
.
This
cannot
affect
enemy
armor
beyond
0
to
deal
bonus
damage.
Armor
reduction
is
the
effect
of
some
items
and
champion
abilities
that
temporarily
reduces
the
armor
of
one
or
more
targets.
This
allows
allies
to
benefit
from
the
reduction
of
armor.
This
can
reduce
armor
below
0,
resulting
in
bonus
damage
(see
Armor
).
Order
of
calculations
When
attacking,
armor
penetration
and
armor
reduction
are
considered
in
the
following
order
[1]
:
Armor
reduction,
flat
Armor
reduction,
percentage
Armor
penetration,
percentage
Armor
penetration,
flat
Flat
armor
reduction
The
target's
armor
is
reduced
by
an
amount.
Flat
armor
reduction
stacks
additively
.
Example:
20
armor
reduction
reduces
the
target's
armor
by
20,
so
a
target
with
30
armor
will
be
reduced
to
10
armor.
(30
−
20
=
10)
Flat
armor
reduction
can
reduce
a
target's
armor
below
zero.
For
example,
if
an
enemy
with
10
armor
has
their
armor
reduced
by
25,
the
enemy
will
have
−15
armor.
Percentage
armor
reduction
The
target's
armor
is
multiplied
by
a
percentage
(100%
−
the
listed
reduction).
Percentage
armor
reduction
stacks
multiplicatively
and
is
ignored
if
the
target's
armor
is
0
or
less.
Example:
20%
armor
reduction
multiplies
the
target's
armor
to
80%,
so
a
target
with
30
armor
will
be
reduced
to
24
armor.
(30
×
0.
8
=
24)
Percentage
armor
reduction
makes
a
bigger
difference
on
targets
with
higher
armor.
For
instance,
with
40%
armor
reduction,
a
target
with
200
armor
will
lose
80
while
a
target
with
only
50
armor
will
lose
20.
Percentage
armor
penetration
The
target's
armor
is
treated
as
being
multiplied
by
a
percentage
for
purposes
of
damage
calculation
(100%
−
the
listed
penetration).
Percentage
armor
penetration
stacks
multiplicatively
and
is
ignored
if
the
target's
armor
is
0
or
less.
Example:
20%
armor
penetration
causes
the
target
to
take
damage
as
if
its
armor
was
multiplied
by
80%,
so
a
target
with
30
armor
will
be
treated
as
though
it
had
24
for
purposes
of
damage
calculation
(the
target's
actual
armor
value
will
not
change,
however).
Because
the
target's
actual
armor
value
does
not
change,
anything
else
depending
on
that
value
also
doesn't
change
(e.g.
Rammus's
Spiked
Shell
).
Percentage
armor
penetration
makes
a
bigger
difference
on
targets
with
higher
armor.
For
instance,
with
40%
armor
penetration,
a
target
with
200
armor
will
be
considered
as
having
80
less
while
a
target
with
only
50
armor
will
be
considered
as
having
20
less.
Flat
armor
penetration
The
target's
armor
is
treated
as
being
reduced
by
an
amount
for
purposes
of
damage
calculation,
but
cannot
be
reduced
below
0.
Flat
armor
penetration
stacks
additively
.
Example:
20
armor
penetration
causes
the
target
to
take
damage
as
if
its
armor
was
20
less,
so
a
target
with
30
armor
will
be
treated
as
though
it
had
10
for
purposes
of
damage
calculation
(the
target's
actual
armor
value
will
not
change,
however).
Because
the
target's
actual
armor
value
does
not
change,
anything
else
depending
on
that
value
also
doesn't
change
(e.g.
Rammus's
Spiked
Shell
).
Examples
Given
20
flat
armor
reduction
and
30%
armor
reduction,
and
the
target
is
affected
by
10
flat
armor
penetration
and
35%
armor
penetration,
Target
A
has
80
armor.
The
80
is
reduced
to
60
by
the
20
armor
reduction.
The
60
is
reduced
to
42
by
the
30%
armor
reduction.
The
42
is
considered
to
be
27.
3
by
the
35%
armor
penetration.
The
27.
3
is
considered
to
be
17.
3
by
the
10
armor
penetration.
Target
A
takes
damage
as
if
it
has
17.
3
armor.
Target
B
has
18
armor.
The
18
is
reduced
to
−2
by
the
20
armor
reduction.
The
−2
is
not
affected
by
any
further
calculations
because
it
is
less
than
0.
Target
B
takes
damage
as
if
it
has
−2
armor.

Notes
Armor
penetration
is
a
very
valuable
stat
for
physical
damage
dealing
champions.
There
are
few
sources
for
it,
so
armor
penetration
Marks
and
Quintessences
are
very
popular
runes.
Armor
penetration
benefits
all
sources
of
physical
damage
including
all
champion
abilities
that
deal
physical
damage.
For
example,
Xin
Zhao's
Crescent
Sweep
will
benefit
from
armor
penetration
as
it
deals
physical
damage,
however
his
Audacious
Charge
will
not
benefit
from
armor
penetration
as
it
deals
magical
damage.
The
items
that
deal
on-hit
physical
damage:
Tiamat
,
Ravenous
Hydra
,
Sheen
,
Iceborn
Gauntlet
and
Trinity
Force
,
will
also
benefit
from
Armor
Penetration.
