Trivia
Orianna
was
developed
by
Xypherous
.
[1]
Orianna
is
voiced
by
Heather
Pennington.
Orianna
bears
some
similarities
to
GLaDOS
from
the
Portal
series,
both
in
voice
acting
and
in
personality.
The
word
"Orianna"
is
a
European
name
and
has
a
few
possible
origins.
They
all
seem
to
refer
to
the
"golden
color
of
the
sun":
"Orianna"
is
the
Irish
meaning
of
"Blonde"
or
"Golden".
The
name
may
also
be
from
the
medieval
Spanish
and
Portuguese
word
"Oroana/Ouroana"
(which
also
means
"Golden").
Another
possible
origin
is
from
the
Latin
meaning
of
"Rising"
(as
in,
"Sunrise").
The
term
"
Clockwork
"
refers
to
the
inner
workings
of
either
a
mechanical
clock
or
a
device
that
operates
in
a
similar
fashion.
Specifically,
a
mechanical
device
utilizing
a
complex
series
of
gears,
such
as
an
automaton
.
Orianna's
Classic
skin
resembles
a
RAcaseal
from
Phantasy
Star
Online
.
Orianna's
title
was
originally
"The
Clockwork
Girl",
but
was
then
changed
to
"The
Lady
of
Clockwork"
the
night
before
her
release.
This
was
due
to
a
film
that
is
in
the
making
called
"
The
Clockwork
Girl
".
Orianna
was
inspired
by
Youmu
Konpaku
from
the
Touhou
Project
series.
[2]
Xypherous'
original
concept
for
Orianna
was
based
on
Hong
Meiling
,
also
from
Touhou
Project
.
[3]
Orianna
is
the
second
champion
to
currently
have
a
difficulty
rating
of
100,
the
first
being
Cassiopeia
,
the
third
being
Syndra
,
and
the
fourth
being
Draven
.
Orianna
has
two
different
emote
animations
depending
on
if
The
Ball
is
attached
to
her
or
not.
Orianna's
automaton
concept
and
background
is
strikingly
similar
to
Olimpia,
a
character
in
E.T.A.
Hoffmann
's
The
Sandman
who
is
the
"daughter"
of
an
inventor.
Orianna
bears
resemblance
to
the
ball-jointed
doll
monster
Karakuriko
from
Sailor
Moon
,
the
Super
S
series,
In
her
Champion
Spotlight
,
her
in-game
icon
seems
to
be
walfas-styled
artwork
instead
of
Orianna's
(it
can
be
seen
here
).
A
group
of
miniature
balls
that
belong
to
Orianna
can
be
seen
on
Corporate
Mundo's
desk
in
the
preview
for
the
launch
of
the
Mac
Version
of
League
of
Legends.
Quotes
Orianna's
joke
"When
you
fall,
you
get
right
back
up."
coincides
with
Aigis
'
line.
Aigis
is
a
female
robot
character
from
the
game
Persona
3
who
says
these
words
when
she
is
hit
by
an
attack
she
is
weak
against.
The
quote
"I
know
what
makes
them
tick.
I
know
how
to
make
the
ticking
stop."
is
a
paraphrased
reference
to
the
character
Sylar
from
the
now-cancelled
NBC
show
Heroes
,
more
specifically
him
describing
his
super-power
.
This
is
also
a
reference
to
the
Magic
the
Gathering
card
Organ
Grinders
flavor
text.
Skins
Sewn
Chaos
Orianna
could
be
a
reference
to
various
doll
characters
from
the
movies
9
,
The
Nightmare
Before
Christmas
,
or
Coraline
.
In
the
Sewn
Chaos
artwork,
there
are
ragdolls
of
Annie
,
Tibbers
,
and
a
purple
caster
minion
.
Bladecraft
Orianna
bears
resemblance
to
Pris,
a
replicant
from
the
movie
Blade
Runner
.
This
skin
also
bears
resemblance
to
the
character
R.
Dorothy
Wayneright
from
the
anime
The
Big
O
in
that
they
share
a
hairstyle
and
color
scheme.
Both
Orianna
and
Dorothy
are
also
artificial
humans
created
by
their
late
human
counterparts'
fathers
after
their
human
selves'
deaths.
It
also
resemble
to
Malice
(a
sex
doll)
the
prinicpal
character
from
the
Anime
Malice@Doll.
Sewn
Chaos
Orianna
used
to
be
her
original
skin,
until
Riot
changed
it
to
her
current
look
before
release
(
According
to
the
initial
concept
art
).
TPA
Orianna
skin
is
related
to
"
Taipei
Assassins
",
who
have
won
the
League
of
Legends
Season
2
World
Championship
finals.
