The
passive
must
have
at
least
a
value
of
550g
for
Sunfire
Cape
to
be
gold
efficient.
Notes
The
passive
AoE
damage
can
be
stacked
by
building
it
on
different
champions
because
Sunfire
Cape's
passive
is
not
an
aura
or
a
debuff
.
It
deals
AoE
damage
over
time
similar
to
Shyvana's
Burnout
,
Dr.
Mundo's
Burning
Agony
,
and
Amumu's
Despair
.
Sunfire
Cape
deals
magic
damage,
so
it
benefits
from
magic
penetration
and
magic
resist
reduction.
Because
of
this,
Abyssal
Scepter
,
Wit's
End
,
and
Sorcerer's
Shoes
synergize
well
with
this
item.
Sunfire
Cape
does
not
proc
Liandry's
Torment's
or
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter's
passives,
but
it
will
proc
Morellonomicon's
passive.
Sunfire
Cape's
magic
damage
per
second
does
not
benefit
from
spell
vamp
.
Sunfire
Cape
will
pull
enemy
turret
aggro
if
it
damages
an
enemy
champion.
Sunfire
Cape's
damage
is
increased
by
Butcher
against
monsters.
Trivia
This
item
has
the
similar
effect
of
the
item
Radiance
in
DotA,
although
the
two
items
grant
different
benefits.

Okay,
so
pretty
much
we
all
konw
that
sunfire
is
a
great
item
especially

more
dmg.

Yes,
it
will.
It's
not
an
aura,
just
a
damage_per_time
similar
to
burnout/burning
agony.

It
