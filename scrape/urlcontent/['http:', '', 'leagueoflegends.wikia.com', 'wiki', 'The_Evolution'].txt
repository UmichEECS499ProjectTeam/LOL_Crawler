Trivia
The
Evolution
was
first
introduced
in
Viktor's
sneak
peek.
[5]
The
Resistance
didn't
appear
until
Jayce's
release
six
months
later.
With
the
rework
of
Jayce's
lore,
it
was
confirmed
that
the
Viktor's
"acolytes"
were
in
fact
"augmented"
denizens
of
Zaun
who
willingly
joined
Viktor's
cause
(as
opposed
to
random
minions).
The
evolution
had
begun.
[1]
It
is
possible
that
the
Augmented
skins
are
part
of
the
Evolution.
Namely:
Augmented
Singed
and
Bioforge
Darius
(originally
Augmented
Darius).
The
Steel
Legion
and
Augmented
themes
are
described
as
futuristic
versions
of
the
Commando
and
Crimson
Elite
themes.
If
the
Augmented
skins
are
related
to
the
Evolution,
then
so
too
could
the
Steel
Legion
skins.
The
Battlecast
skins
were
officially
tied
to
the
Evolution
with
the
release
of
Battlecast
Prime
Cho'Gath.
[2]
[6]
V-BC-Corp,
the
in-game
corporation
responsible
for
Battlecast
Prime
Cho'Gath
[7]
,
likely
stands
for
Viktor's
Battle-Cast
Corporation.
"The
Resistance"
is
believed
to
be
the
name
for
Jayce's
resistance.
While
not
used
in
an
official
context,
it
is
seen
used
by
several
Riot
members
[8]
,
and
a
Riot
member
posted
an
urgent
broadcast
foreshadowing
Battlecast
Cho'Gath's
release
under
than
name
"Recon
Team"
with
the
job
title
"The
Resistance".
[9]
Riot
member,
20thCenturyFaux,
describes
the
use
of
robots
to
fight
robots
as
a
Red
Queen's
Race
,
in
response
to
a
comment
on
Pulsefire
Ezreal's
"augments"
and
the
Full
Metal
skins.
[3]
Full
Metal
Rammus'
artwork
features
an
arm
that
resembles
one
of
Viktor's,
down
to
the
odd
number
of
fingers
and
many
joints.
A
silhouette
resembling
either
Soraka
or
Zilean
can
be
seen
in
the
background,
possibly
teasing
at
a
future
addition
to
the
Full
Metal
theme.
The
community
has
jokingly
named
the
would-be
skin,
Heal
Bot
Soraka
.
Resistance
Caitlyn
,
Full
Metal
Pantheon
and
Battlecast
Xerath
would
be
connected
to
this
theme
through
retroactive
continuity
,
as
the
skins
were
released
before
Viktor
.
