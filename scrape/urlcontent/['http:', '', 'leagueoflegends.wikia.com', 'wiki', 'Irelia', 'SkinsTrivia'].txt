Trivia
Irelia
was
designed
by
Ezreal
.
Irelia's
swords
stab
her
as
she
dies.
Whether
Irelia
does
this
out
of
honor
or
due
to
losing
control
of
her
blades
is
up
to
debate.
The
floating
object
behind
her
head
is
the
"Mantle
of
Decorum",
which
is
Ionia's
highest
decoration.
Irelia
was
one
of
the
champions
chosen
for
the
Ionian
pool
available
during
the
2010
Ionian
Versus
Noxus
Grudge
Match
.
However,
she
was
not
one
of
the
selected
champions.
It
has
been
hinted
that
Irelia's
brother
Zelos
is
possibly
being
made
into
a
champion
and
is
currently
in
development.
Irelia,
has
among
the
highest
potential
tenacity
stat
in
the
game,
capped
at
64.9%
(40%
from
her
passive
,
granted
at
least
3
enemy
champions
are
within
her
sights,
15%
from
the
Tenacious
mastery
and
35%
from
any
tenacity
item
in
the
game,
i.e.
Mercury's
Treads
after
being
calculated
with
diminishing
returns).
Thus,
the
duration
of
almost
all
crowd
control
effects
in
the
game
can
be
cut
by
more
than
half
against
Irelia.
Previously,
Zac
could
achieve
86.18%
tenacity,
the
highest,
while
using
Let's
Bounce!
,
Tenacious
and
35%
from
tenacity
items
in-game.
However,
this
only
lasts
for
the
duration
of
Let's
Bounce!
and
so
Irelia's
is
more
reliable.
This
is
no
longer
possible
after
the
tenacity
boost
from
Zac's
ultimate
is
removed.
Irelia
is
the
focus
of
a
LoL
meme
"better
nerf
Irelia",
in
which
Morello
determines
that
a
certain
champion
is
currently
overpowered,
but
chooses
instead
to
nerf
Irelia,
due
to
his
numerous
alterations
to
her
skillset.
Irelia
received
nerfs
one
day
before
her
release
because
Morello
said
she
was
too
"annoying
to
play
against."
ricklessabandon
stated
that
Irelia
is
somewhat
similar
to
a
lich,
and
her
weapon
acts
as
her
phylactery.
[1]
The
naming
of
her
style,
"Hiten
Style",
her
backstory,
and
Xypherous'
confirmation
show
Irelia
is
based
on
Kenshin
Himura
of
Rurouni
Kenshin.
[2]
Quotes
Her
French
jokes
are
references
to
the
character
of
Brice
de
Nice
from
the
eponymous
French
film.
Her
joke
"My
blade
is
not
only
precise,
but
totally
gnarly"
references
that
she
rides
her
weapon
like
a
surfboard
and
"gnarly"
being
a
term
used
by
most
surfers
to
tell
if
something
is
cool
or
good.
Irelia
shares
a
quote
with
Garen
:
"Forge
Onward."
Irelia
shares
a
quote
with
Ezreal
,
Annie
,
Thresh
,
and
Evelynn
:
"This
way."
Skins
Aviator
Irelia
is
a
reference
to
Amelia
Earhart
,
the
first
woman
to
fly
solo
across
the
Atlantic
Ocean.
Chinese
Nightblade
Irelia
is
similar
to
the
Assassin's
Creed
2
cover,
both
Ezio
and
Irelia
bearing
the
hidden
blade
on
both
of
their
arms
and
making
the
same
stance.
Nightblade
Irelia
also
bares
similarities
to
Marvel
Comic's
character
"Blackwidow"
due
to
the
black
outfit
and
red
belt
buckle.
Nightblade
Irelia
shares
a
striking
resemblance
to
Silverfang
Akali
in
design.
Relations
Soraka
was
responsible
for
reviving
a
nearly
deceased
Irelia
during
the
Noxian
invasion
of
Ionia.
