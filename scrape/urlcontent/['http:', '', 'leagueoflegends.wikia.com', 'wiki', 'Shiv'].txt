The
lowest
base
movement
speed
in
the
game
is
325.
At
this
speed,
Statikk
Shiv
grants
19.
5
movement
speed.
The
movement
speed
stat
only
increases
flat
movement
speed,
and
will
not
interact
with
other
percentage
increases.
An
autoattack
provides
10
charges.
Moving
by
any
means
provides
5
charges
for
every
100
in-game
units
traveled.
This
includes
walking,
using
dash
or
blink
abilities
like
Tristana's
Rocket
Jump
or
Flash
,
or
casting
Recall
.
This
item
usually
charges
much
faster
by
moving
than
attacking.
Considering
a
movement
speed
of
~400
units
per
second
(around
average),
moving
gains
20
charges
per
second,
while
an
average
attack
speed
of
~1.
25
attacks
per
second
grants
10-15
charges
per
second.
The

effect's
damage

by
critical

modifiers
like
Infinity

and
Shaco's

.
Runaan's
Hurricane
charges
Statikk
Shiv's
passive
up
to
3
times
as
fast
by
autoattacking
with
enough
targets
in
range
of
Runaan's
effect,
which
means
charging
by
autoattacking
is
technically
an
on-hit
effect.
This
allows
you
to
gain
30
charges
per
autoattack,
and
synergizes
well
with
the
attack
speed
bonus
on
both
items,
as
this
combination
also
gives
110%
attack
speed
,
further
improving
its
passive.
The
visual
effect
for
the
lightning
proc
is
the
same
as
Ionic
Spark
,
but
the
arcs
originate
from
the
initial
attack
target
rather
than
from
Statikk
Shiv's
user.
The
passive
magic
damage
will
only
critically
strike
if
the
associated
attack
critically
strikes.
Statikk
