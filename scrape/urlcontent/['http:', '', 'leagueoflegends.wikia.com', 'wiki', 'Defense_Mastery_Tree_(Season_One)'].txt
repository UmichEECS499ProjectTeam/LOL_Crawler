The
Defense
Mastery
Tree
is
one
of
the
three
Mastery
branches.
All
masteries
were
redesigned
on
November

2011.
The
information
from
this
article
refers
to
the
version
of
this
mastery
tree
used
before
the
redesign.
Focus
Its
main
focus
was
to
give
advantage
to
defensive
actions
like
armor
,
magic
resistance
,
health
,
and
health
regeneration
among
other
defensive
buffs
.
The
Summoner
Spells
Heal
(Tier
1),
Revive
(Tier
1),
Cleanse
(Tier
4),
Garrison
(Tier
5)
and
Fortify
(Tier
5)
are
improved
by
this
Mastery.
It
would
take
31
points
to
max
the
Defense
Mastery
Tree
out.
