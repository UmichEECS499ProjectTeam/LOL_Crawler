usage
Deciding
what
spell
to
apply
Blaze
first
with
is
a
very
important
factor
when
engaging
the
enemy.
If
you
are
able
to
cast
your
spells
quickly,
Brand
can
actually
be
very
effective
at
close
range.
Close
proximity
allows
Sear
to
hit
a
lot
easier,
so
if
Conflagration
is
used
just
before
the
missile
hits,
the
stun
is
very
reliable.
Pillar
of
Flame
has
the
longest
cooldown
of
all
Brand's
basic
abilities.
Because
of
this,
it
is
not
the
best
ability
to
kill
a
single
champion
.
Brand
can
easily
clear
minion
waves.
Pillar
of
Flame
will
allow
Conflagration
to
deal
area
of
effect
damage
due
to
the
active
Blaze
debuff.
An
effective
combo
to
clear
minion
waves
is
to
use
Sear
on
a
minion
positioned
close
to
the
middle
of
the
wave,
Conflagration
the
Blazed
minion,
then
Pillar
of
Flame
all
Blazed
minions
to
deal
increased
damage.
A
great
time
to
use
Brand's
Pyroclasm
is
when
two
enemy
champions
are
standing
close
to
each
other.
By
using
Pyroclasm's
bounce,
Brand
can
cast
on
a
nearby
enemy
and
subsequently
hit,
or
even
kill,
a
weakened
enemy
Champion
who
would
otherwise
be
out
of
range.
Pyroclasm
does
not
prioritize
Champions
unless
hitting
a
target
afflicted
with
Blaze,
so
avoid
casting
it
when
close
to
minions
or
neutral
monsters.
Remember
that
Brand
,
like
LeBlanc
,
is
primarily
a
combo
champion.
Using
one
spell
at
a
time
is
a
huge
waste
of
damage
potential,
and
it's
better
to
stay
at
the
back
of
the
fight
while
waiting
for
your
cooldowns
on
one
of
your
3
main
abilities.
When
you
are
focused
on
one
champion,
your
combo
should
usually
be
Conflagration
,
Sear
,
then
Pillar
of
Flame
.
This
combo
allows
Sear
to
stun,
ensuring
the
enemy
will
be
in
the
AoE
for
Pillar
of
Flame
and
offering
little
time
for
them
to
retaliate.
If
you
are
fast
enough,
you
may
be
able
to
cast
Sear
first
and,
while
the
missile
is
on
its
way
to
the
target,
hit
them
with
Conflagration
before
it
connects
and
throw
down
Pillar
of
Flame
.
When
you
want
to
do
maximum
damage
to
multiple
enemies,
pick
a
target,
cast
Sear
at
them,
after
Blaze
is
applied,
cast
Conflagration
to
hit
multiple
targets
and
apply
Blaze
to
each
one,
then
finish
with
Pillar
of
Flame
.
This
combo,
if
all
hits
connect,
can
do
huge
AoE
damage.
If
your
Pyroclasm
is
off
cooldown,
throw
it
out
as
soon
as
enemies
are
grouped
together
enough.
Brand
makes
an
excellent
choice
as
a
solo
laner
as
the
AoE
,
combo-effectiveness
of
his
spells
allows
him
to
farm
minions
quite
well
and
keep
opponents
out
of
exp
range
and
from
last-hitting
minions.
His
high
mana
cost,
however,
means
frequent
trips
back
to
base.
Be
wary
of
being
caught
on
low
mana,
because
his
anti-champion
combo
is
relatively
expensive.
Brand
has
a
very
effective
escape
mechanism.
Inflict
Blaze
by
using
Conflagration
,
and
then
stun
with
Sear
while
running.
Do
not
cast
Pillar
of
Flame
as
it
has
a
longer
spellcast
animation,
which
isn't
beneficial
when
trying
to
escape.
Build
usage
Because
Brand
is
a
mid-range
caster,
he
greatly
benefits
from
Rod
of
Ages
,
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
and
Zhonya's
Hourglass
.
These
items
are
of
moderate-expensive
cost
and
provide
a
great
amount
of
survivability.
The
unique
active
from
the
Zhonya's
Hourglass
will
help
keep
yourself
alive
in
a
pinch
and
allow
you
to
wait
for
cooldowns.
The
health
from
the
Rod
of
Ages
combined
with
the
armor
from
Zhonya's
Hourglass
will
make
Brand
more
resilient,
on
top
of
the
offensive
benefits
of
having
more
ability
power
.
Items
that
provide
magic
penetration
such
as
Sorcerer's
Shoes
,
Haunting
Guise
,
and
Void
Staff
are
good
for
Brand
since
his
passive
Blaze
does
not
benefit
from
ability
power
but
does
benefit
from
magic
penetration
.
Getting
every
one
of
those
items
will
sacrifice
a
great
deal
of
other
stats
like
health
and
resistances,
so
getting
all
3
isn't
recommended.
Abyssal
Scepter
is
another
item
which
can
accomplish
the
same
effect
for
Brand
,
though
the
effect
is
less
reliable
for
him
so
it
should
only
be
considered
if
you
find
yourself
in
need
of
magic
resistance
.
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
will
be
very
effective
for
Brand
since
he
deals
a
lot
of
AoE
damage,
and
since
the
proc
effect
adds
slows
to
his
abilities.
It
also
keeps
his
enemies
in
range
of
his
skill
shots
and
helps
slow
champions
to
make
it
harder
to
avoid
the
bounces
on
his
ultimate.
It
even
adds
to
his
passive,
effectively
giving
everyone
you
hit
a
5.5s
slow
even
after
you
stop
casting.
Will
of
the
Ancients
is
notably
effective
on
Brand
since
all
of
his
spells
deal
high
AoE
magical
damage,
which
all
proc
spell
vamp
.
Note
that
spell
vamp
only
has
a
33%
effect
with
AoE
spells
and
does
work
with
his
passive
Blaze
Survivability
items
are
essential
for
Brand
due
to
his
very
low
health
and
defensive
stats.
Even
a
fed
Brand
can
be
taken
down
fairly
quickly
and/or
easily
if
he
does
not
accomodate
for
his
lack
of
survivability.
Blaze
procs
Blackfire
Torch
and
Liandry's
Torment
,
which
also
deals
percent
magic
damage
based
on
health.
As
such,
it
is
practically
a
given
on
any
Brand
build,
and
can
easily
replace
Rod
of
Ages
for
survivability
purposes.
Athene's
Unholy
Grail
is
a
very
useful
item
for
Brand
,
granting
him
a
decent
chunk
of
ability
power
and
cooldown
reduction,
while
also
granting
him
the
mana
regen
to
spam
his
spells
significantly
more
frequently.
An
early
Chalice
of
Harmony
is
a
highly
effective
purchase,
offering
unparalleled
mana
regeneration
for
a
very
low
cost.
Morellonomicon
is
very
effective
for
Brand
,
due
to
it's
healing
reduction
passive
proccing
off
of
Blaze
,
as
well
as
it's
high
cooldown
reduction,
ability
power,
and
mana
regeneration.

Countering
Brand
has
no
escapes,
and,
to
successfully
kite
an
opponent,
must
apply
Blaze
then
successfully
land
Sear
.
Play
aggressively
early
game
and
target
him
at
any
time
he
overextends.
When
playing
against
Brand
,
remember
that
he
is
a
combo-based
champion.
Interrupting
his
cast
flow
is
detrimental
to
his
damage
output.
Brand
is
countered
in
this
aspect
by
stuns
and
silences
,
and,
in
careful
application,
can
be
very
effective
counters
during
team
fights.
Example,
Zhonya's
Hourglass
and
Vladimir's
Sanguine
pool.
When
he
is
at
a
distance,
Sear
is
easy
to
dodge,
but
be
careful
about
getting
near
him
in
a
fight
if
you
are
squishy.
Be
careful
about
facing
Brand
1v1
or
2v1
(with
Brand
being
the
one).
Brand's
1v1
damage
output
is
still
great
despite
having
AoE
spells,
he
has
a
2
second
stun
from
Sear
while
the
target
is
Blaze
.
2v1
would
be
even
worse
after
he
hits
level
6,
as
his
ultimate
will
be
able
to
do
tremendous
damage
to
you
and
your
teammate.
When
fighting
against
Brand
in
a
team
fight,
try
not
to
stick
close
to
your
teammates.
Brand's
AoEs
spells
are
rather
small
but
very
deadly.
When
Blaze
is
applied
to
you,
be
very
careful
about
getting
within
Brand's
range,
especially
if
he
can
hit
you
with
Sear
,
as
this
opens
you
up
to
a
lot
of
burst
damage.
During
laning,
be
careful
about
being
on
the
wrong
side
of
your
minions
when
against
Brand
.
With
his
full
combo,
he
can
deal
a
large
amount
of
damage
while
stunning
you
to
prevent
retaliation.
Your
team
should
scatter
to
avoid
taking
massive
AoE
damage
from
Brand
,
especially
after
he
casts
Pyroclasm
.
Pyroclasm
does
not
focus
champions
unless
applied
with
Blaze
,
so
try
to
pass
it
off
onto
a
group
of
minions
or
jungle
monsters.
A
Banshee's
Veil
is
a
great
item
to
counter
him.
While
it
won't
completely
negate
the
damage
Brand
does,
it
will
make
it
harder
for
him
to
combo
off
properly.
