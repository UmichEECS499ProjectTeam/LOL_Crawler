Only
one
item
can
grant
a
champion
tenacity
at
a
time
-
it
does
not

.
Cloak
and
Dagger
was
particularly
suited
to
physical
damage
assassins
who
relied
on
Boots
of
Mobility
for
securing
ambushes
as
a
tenacity
alternative
to
Mercury's
Treads
.
Tenacity's
reduced
crowd

duration
can
ease
the
effects
of
hard-to-avoid
crowd

spells
such
as
Ryze's
Rune
Prison
,
giving
ambushers
yet
another
avenue
through
which
to
attempt
to
take
opponents
by
surprise.

dagger
is
a
term
that
refers

created
at
the
Institute
of
War.
Cloak
and
Dagger
was
the
most
expensive
tenacity
item.
