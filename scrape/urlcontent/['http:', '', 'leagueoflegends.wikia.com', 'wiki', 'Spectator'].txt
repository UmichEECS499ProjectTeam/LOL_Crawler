Spectator
Mode
is
a
mode
of
League
of
Legends
that
allows
a
player
to
observe,
but
not
play
in
a
game.
It
was
first
introduced
at
the
Dreamhack
Season
One
Championship
,
but
has
seen
little
use,
even
at
the
following
tournaments.
On
November
10,
2011,
it
was
reintroduced
to
custom
games
for
beta
testing.
Spectating
League
of
Legends
enables
players
to
observe
games
in
progress
in
Spectator
Mode.
Spectator
Mode
is
different
from
a
normal
player's
perspective
in
a
number
of
ways.
For
starters,
a
spectating
player
has
no
champion
to
command
or
team
affiliation.
Instead,
he
is
able
to
jump
to
the
perspective
of
either
team,
following
the
action
as
they
see
it.
A
spectator
can
even
choose
to
remove
the
fog
of
war
altogether
for
a
global
view
of
the
battlefield.
Additionally
the
spectator
will
be
able
to
quickly
and
easily
access
information
on
either
team
such
as
in-game
stats,
item
builds,
gold
totals,
and
ability
cooldowns.
Ghosting
For
the
summoner
spell,
please
see
Ghost
Ghosting
is
a
term
coined
by
definition
when
a
summoner
observes
a
stream
in
an
attempt
to
gain
advantage
against
a
opponent.
There
are
many
methods
of
doing
this,
with
some
of
the
most
popular
including
having
a
friend
open
the
stream
and
relay
the
information
by
mouth
or
over
TeamSpeak,
a
low
CPU-usage
gaming
program
that
allows
summoners
to
communicate
vocally
during
matches.
Another
widely-used
method
includes
running
a
Smurf
account
on
a
separate
computer
and
having
the
stream
open
and
viewable.
Despite
having
an
initial
3-minute
delay,
it
is
possible
to
view
the
match(es)
live,
thus
the
introduction
of
Ghosting.
Spectator
mode
can
be
an
excellent
tool
for
those
players
interested
in
learning
more
of
the
nuances
of
League
of
Legends
gameplay,
or
for
shoutcasters
interested
in
commentating
on
competitive
play.

in
the
game.
Allowance
of
Spectators
How
many
players
are

game?

slots
available
in
each
custom

of
League
of
Legends,
though
that
number
is
subject
to
change.
Will
spectating
players
be
able
to
tell
my
opponents
what's
happening?
No.
There
is
a
three-minute
delay
built
into
Spectator
Mode
to
prevent
observing
players
from
being
able
to
provide
intelligence
to
the
competitors.
See
Ghosting
Am
I
able
to
kick
a
spectator
from
the
game
lobby

the
game
starts?

If
you
are
the
game
owner
and
do
not
want
a
player
observing
your
game
you
are
free
to

or
ban
them
from
the
game
lobby.
Will
there
be
privacy
settings
that
I
can
use
to
restrict
who
can
spectate
my
games?
Game
hosts
have
the
option
to
allow
or
disallow
spectators.

also
must

your
game
as
a
spectator

spectating
your

the
option
to
kick
or

them

Spectator
Mode
UI
Team
Fight
User
Interface
With
the
introduction
of
Patch
V3.11
,
a
new
interface
has
been
developed
for
usage
within
spectator
mode.
We’ve
developed
a
new
Team
Fight
UI
for
spectator
mode
that
minimizes
and
concentrates
the
UI
so
that
it’s
easier
to
focus
on
the
action
during
team
fights.
With
this
change
we’ve
optimized
the
display
of
battle
information
in
team
fights,
including
who’s
involved
in
the
fight,
who’s
winning,
and
how
many
people
have
died
on
either
team.
―-Riot
Pwyff
Some
of
the
new
features
of
the
UI
include:
While
spectating,
press
'A'
to
toggle
the
Team
Fight
UI
Minimalist
UI
mode
that
focuses
on
presenting
information
relevant
