Trivia
This
item
is
named
after
the
summoner
Wooglet
for
referring
the
number
of
summoners
needed
to
get
an
item
named
after
them.
[2]
It
is
a
new
version
of
Zhonya's
Ring
especially
for
Twisted
Treeline
and
Dominion
,
because
Rabadon's
Deathcap
is
not
a
niche
item
for
fast-paced
gameplay.
All
by
itself
it
gives
125
ability
power
.
While
the
active
effect
is
used,
any
pets
the
user
currently
has
(e.g.
Mordekaiser's
Children
of
the
Grave
or
Annie's
Summon:
Tibbers
)
cannot
be
issued
with
any
new
commands.
