There
are
few
dwellers,
let
alone
champions
,
residing
in
the
blasted
and
dangerous
lands
that
lie
south
of
the
Great
Barrier.
Much
of
that
world
still
bears
the
scars
of
past
Rune
Wars,
especially
the
mysterious
Kumungu
Jungle.
There
are
long-forgotten
treasures
in
these
strange
places
which
many
risk
life
and
limb
to
acquire.
The
champion
known
as
Nidalee
was
only
a
young
girl
traveling
with
her
treasure-seeking
parents
when
they
lost
their
way
in
the
dense,
rainy
jungles.
The
jungle
was
unforgiving,
and
she
watched
her
parents
suffer
agonizing
final
days
as
they
fell
victim
to
a
mysterious
and
vicious
disease.
As
improbable
as
it
was
for
a
child
to
survive
in
the
inhospitable
jungle
by
herself,
she
did
just
that.
Her
youthful
innocence
and
a
fortunate
naivete
caused
her
to
appeal
to
the
beasts
of
that
place
and
she
was
taken
in
by
a
family
of
cougars
and
raised
as
one
of
their
own.
She
grew
and
somehow
absorbed
the
raw
magic
of
the
dense
wilds,
evolving
beyond
both
her
human
physiology
and
her
feline
affectation.
On
one
pivotal
day
in
her
life,
standing
over
the
torn
remnants
of
a
Noxian
squad
of
woodcutters,
Nidalee
chose
to
rejoin
the
so-called
civilized
world,
to
fight
in
the
League
of
Legends
so
as
to
protect
the
vast
woods
from
both
Demacia
and
Noxus.
"Nidalee
was
taught
to
fight
by
her
feline
family,
battling
viciously
with
tooth
and
nail.
Something
in
her
feline
ways
may
draw
you
to
her,
but
remember
that
she
is
no
pussycat."

by

Many
of
you
have
been
asking
for
a
new
look
for
Nidalee.
We're
pleased
to
announce
that
we've
heard
you,
and
that
you
can
expect
a
complete
Visual
Upgrade
for
the
Bestial
Huntress
in
an
upcoming
patch.
In
addition
to
a
new
model
for
both
lady
and
cougar,
this
update
includes
new
animations
and
spell
effects
across
both
of
her
forms.
We'll
also
be
upgrading
the
model
and
splash
art
for
all
of
Nidalee's
skins,
so
you
can
enjoy
the
latest
fashion,
whether
you’re
a
French
Maid
or
a
Pharaoh.
The
next
time
you
feel
the
need
to
go
swiftly
slinking
through
the
brush,
ready
to
pounce
on
an
unsuspecting
foe,
do
so
knowing
you
look
stunningly
stylish.
