Redirected
from
Ranked
match
A
ranked
game
is
a
draft
mode
game
type
available
to
level
30
summoners
with
at
least
16
champions
available
(NOT
including
free
week
champions).
Summoners
are
placed
on
a
game
ladder
and
ranked
against
one
another
according
to
a
hidden
Matchmaking
Rating.
Players
are
divided
into
Challenger,
Diamond,
Platinum,
Gold,
Silver
and
Bronze
tiers,
with
each
tier
further
subdivided
into
5
divisions,
apart
from
Challenger,
which
only
has
one
tier.
Once
gained,
a
tier
cannot
be
lost
except
by
four
weeks
of
inactivity
in
the
particular
ranked
mode
(this
applies
only
to
tiers,
and
not
divisions).
Furthermore,
inactivity
may
result
in
a
change
of
league
placement
upon
re-activation.
Players
who
have
not
played
their
first
10
"placement"
games
will
not
be
able
to
see
their
rating
in
their
profile
until
the
10
are
played,
at
which
point
they
will
be
placed
in
a
particular
League,
and
corresponding
Tier
and
Division.
Ranked
games
are
considered
the
competitive
alternative
to
normal
games
.
Premade
teams
Ranked
games
are
playable
in
both
the
3v3
and
5v5
bracket.
In
the
3v3
bracket,
you
must
queue
as
a
complete
team
consisting
of
3
players.
In
the
5v5
bracket,
you
can
queue
as
a
full
team
consisting
of
5
players,
as
a
duo
queue
with
1
other
person,
or
as
a
solo
queue.
Statistics
are
recorded
for
ranked
games
by
the
type
of
queue
that
you
initiated
the
game
with.
Premade:
In
team-based
ranked
play,
a
player
will
have
to
set
up
a
3-man
and
5-man
team
with
which
to
play
for
3v3
and
5v5
matches
respectively.
In
order
to
participate,
you
must
be
a
member
of
a
ranked
team,
which
can
be
formed
by
any
level
30
player.
This
is
done
through
the
'Create
a
Ranked
Team'
button
on
one's
profile.
Non-Premade:
In
non-team
ranked
play,
a
player
will
be
able
to
either
play
solo,
or
in
a
two-man
team
(duo).
This
is
only
available
for
5v5
matches.
Differences
compared
to
blind
pick
games
Ranked
games
always
use
draft
pick,
which
differs
from
blind
pick
games
in
the
following
ways.
Banning
Phase
:
At
the
start
of
champion
selection,
team
captains
have
the
opportunity
to
ban
a
total
of
6
champions.
The
bans
alternate
between
the
teams,
blue
team
starting.
During
the
banning
phase,
each
team
can
see
their
opponent's
available
champions
in
order
to
ban
viable
options.
Champion
Selection
:
The
team
that
receives
first
ban
gets
the
first
pick.
After
the
initial
pick,
teams
alternate
and
pick
two
at
a
time
until
each
summoner
has
chosen
a
champion.
No
champion
can
be
selected
more
than
once
in
a
game.
Trade
:
When
all
the
members
of
a
team
have
locked
in,
there
is
an
opportunity
to
make
a
trade
within
your
team.
Both
members
of
the
team
must
own
both
champions
involved.
One
player
can
initate
the
trade,
and
when
the
other
confirms
it
their
champions
are
swapped.
It
is
possible
to
execute
multiple
trades
before
the
game
begins.
Therefore,
trades
are
often
implemented
in
order
to
secure
high
tier
champions
early
on
to
be
swapped
with
the
intended
player
instead
of
risking
the
other
team
taking
them.
Leaves
:
Queue
dodging
is
punished
by
5
minutes
of
wait
for
the
first
offense
and
30
minutes
to
1
hour
for
subsequent
offenses.
Leaves
are
punished
by
a
loss
of
elo
for
the
player
regardless
of
the
match's
outcome
if
the
player
is
AFK
for
at
least
5
minutes
before
the
game
ends.
