30%.

permanently
grants
the

the

Eleisa's
Miracle
(including
Aid)
if
you
gain
three
levels
while
in
possession
of
the
item,
and
consumes
the
item.
The
following
items
grant
Aid
and
Eleisa's
Blessing:
Eleisa's
Miracle
The
fact
the
effects
are
named
is
because
Eleisa's
Blessing
consumes
the
item,
and
thus
a
global
unique
needed
to
prevent
players
from
purchasing
the
item
again.
Bounty

assists
and

seconds.
The

items
grant
Lucky
Shadow:
Kage's
Lucky

The
effect
could
have
been
named
to
emphasize
the
fact
it
would
stack
with
Avarice
Blade's
Avarice
and
Philosopher's
Stone's
Transmute
,
as
there
was
some
confusion
in
Season
Two
about
whether
or
not
the
gold
per
10
passives
stacked.
Mana
