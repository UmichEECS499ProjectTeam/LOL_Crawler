Blue

The
Recall
button
in
game
Recall
is
an
ability
that
every
summoner
has,
regardless
of
champion
chosen.
The
spell
allows
a
champion
to
hard
channel
for
8
seconds
(or
4.
5
seconds
in
Dominion)
and
teleport
back
to
the
Spawn
Pool
after
the
channel
is
completed
(provided
the
channel
is
not
interrupted).

Development
history
Recall
artwork
Blue
Pill
The
Recall
function
was
originally
tied
to
Blue
Pill
,
which
was
a
purchasable
item
that
could
be
activated
to
return
to
base.
The
function
was
then
made
into
an
optional
summoner
spell
,
and
eventually
into
a
feature
inherent
in
all
champions.
Gameplay
Recall
is
activated
either
by
clicking
the
Recall
button
on
the
ability
panel
or
by
pressing
the
key
to
which
the
function
is
bound
("B"
by
default).
After
activating
Recall,
the
champion
will
enter
a
hard
channel
state
for
8
seconds.
The
channel
will
cancel
if
the
champion
is
hit
by
any
attack
or
spell,
moves,
or
performs
most
actions.
If
the
channel
is
successfully
completed,
the
champion
will
be
teleported
to
his
or
her
team's
respective
respawn
point.
Strategy
While
beginning
to
fade
away
to
stealth,
you
can
begin
casting
Recall
or
Improved
Recall.
This
does
not
work
with
instant
stealth
spells,
such
as
Talon's
Shadow
Assault
or
Teemo's
Camouflage
.
Enhanced
Recall
Enhanced
Recall
When
Dominion
was
released,
Recall
was
remade
to
fit
in
to
the
game
mode's
fast-paced
style,
creating
Enhanced
Recall
which
takes
4.
5
seconds
to
channel.
Improved
Recall
In
Season
Two
,
the
Utility
mastery
tree
included
the
tier
1
mastery
Improved
Recall
to
reduce
the
cast
time
of
Recall
by
1
second
and
Enhanced
Recall
by
0.
5
seconds.
In
Season
4
,
the
new
Utility
Mastery
Tree
includes
the
tier
1
mastery
Phasewalker
to
reduce
the
channel
time
of
Recall
by
1
second
and
Enhanced
Recall
by
0.
5
seconds.
Recall
Animation
Since
V1.0.0.140
patch,
new
champions
and
certain
skins,
like
legendary
skins
(e.g.
Battlecast
Prime
Cho'Gath
),
have
received
a
special
recall
animation
and
a
few
have
received
special
quotes.
Also,
when
an
older
champion
gets
a
visual
upgrade,
all
of
his
or
her
skins
are
outfitted
with
a
new
recall
animation.
Below
is
a
list
of
champions
and
skins
released
that
currently
have
recall
animations:

disconnection
When
a
player
leaves
the
game
his
or
her
champion
will
automatically
attempt
to
walk
back
to
base.
Soon
after
arriving
at
the
base,
the
champion
gains
a
huge
bonus
to
magic
resistance
and
armor;
this
is
to
prevent
enemies
from
using
global
abilities
(like
Karthus's
Requiem
and
Draven's
Whirling
Death
)
to
instantly
kill
champions
that
have
disconnected
early
in
the
game.
Players
who
have
disconnected
prior
to
the
game
starting
are
granted
the
same
bonus
Magic
Resistance/Armor.
Notes
This
article
is
outdated.
Please
update
this
article
to
reflect
recent
events
or
newly
available
information.
It
is
possible
to
perform
certain
actions
without
disrupting
Recall.
This
includes
all
gestures
(dance,
joke,
laugh,
and
taunt)
as
well
as
certain
spells
or
items
such
as
Barrier.
Furthermore,
it
is
possible
to
take
damage
while
recalling
without
being
interrupted.
This
happens
when
the
recalling
champion
has
a
shield
and
the
damage
taken
is
less
than
the
health
provided
by
of
the
shield.
Also,
the
channel
must
not
be
interrupted
by
crowd
control.
Although
champions
may
not
move
or
activate
abilities,
having
abilities
cast
on
them
by
teammates,
such
as
Janna's
Eye
Of
The
Storm
will
not
disrupt
Recall.
Recall
is
neither
visible
nor
audible
through
the
fog
of
war.
It
is
sometimes
possible
to
be
damaged
while
recalling,
but
still
return
to
base.
This
happens
if
the
damage
is
taken
within
an
extremely
small
window
(approx.
0.
2
seconds
or
less)
before
the
channel
completes.
If
this
happens
while
recalling
with
very
low
health,
it
is
actually
possible
to
arrive
dead
at
the
base.
Trivia
The
old
Blue
Pill
is
possibly
a
reference
to
the
film
The
Matrix
.
In
the
film
Neo
is
offered
the
chance
to
take
a
red
or
a
blue
pill,
signifying
his
choice
of
whether
to
continue
living
in
the
world
he
knows
or
to
wake
up.
It
was
previously
possible
for
champions
with
abilities
that
make
them
dash
to
an
enemy
champion
to
follow
an
enemy
that
has
just
finished
recalling
and
teleported
to
base,
making
the
champion
fly
all
the
way
to
the
enemy
base.
Projectiles
will
still
do
so.
If
you
recall
while
the
Nexus
is
destroyed,
the
camera
will
attempt
to
center
on
your
champion
rather
than
the
exploding
Nexus.
When
he
was
first
remade,
an
oversight
allowed
Ryze
to
be
able
to
use
Recall
to
trigger
his
Arcane
Mastery
passive,
so
he
could
refresh
the
cooldowns
of
all
of
his
abilities
by
simply
rapidly
pressing
the
recall
key.
