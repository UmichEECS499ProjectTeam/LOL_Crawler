Notes
Dealing
or
receiving
damage
from
any
source
(including
champions,
monsters,
towers,
and
minions)
counts
as
combat
and
will
result
in
the
base
movement
speed
bonus
of
25.
There
is
no
range
limitation
on
this
damage.
The
application
of
any
non-damaging
combat
debuff
(such
as
exhaust)
to
an
opponent
will
trigger
this
state
as
well.
If
invulnerable
(such
as
being
under
the
effects
of
Kayle's
Intervention
),
then
autoattacks
and
non-cc
abilities
will
not
trigger
this
state.
Heals
and
buffs
to
allies
are
not
counted
as
combat.
Damage-over-time
spells
and
abilities
reset
the
timer
with
each
tick
of
damage.
Strategy
This
item
is
especially
useful
if
you
don't
have
a
Teleport
to
switch
lanes.
This
item
is
good
in
particular
early-mid
game
on
roaming
champions
,
that
want
to
quickly
gank
different
lanes.
They
lose
most
value
when
team
fights
start
to
happen.
It
also
allows
for
chasing
and
escaping.
When
escaping,
remember
that
poking
(e.g.
Ashe's
Frost
Shot
)
will
reset
the
movement
speed,
however,
healing
yourself
(e.g.
Taric's
Imbue
)
will
let
you
keep
the
105
movement
speed
buff.
