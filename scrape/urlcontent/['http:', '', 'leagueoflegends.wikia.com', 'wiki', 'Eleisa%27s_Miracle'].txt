Eleisa's

is
gold
efficient
even
without
its
passive.
Note
Riot's
website
and
in
game
has
the
passive
wrongly
written
as
30%.
Its
effect
only
reduce
the
summoner's
spell
by
25%
in
game.
(tested)
Players
have
to
upgrade
their
Philosopher's
Stone
into
Eleisa's
Miracle
before
level

if
they
want

Miracle
passive.
Trivia
Eleisa's
Miracle
is
the
cheapest
legendary
-tier
item
in
the
game.
Eleisa's
Miracle
is
the
only
item
that
grants
its
effects
permanently
and
disappears
from
the
wearer's
inventory.
The
Aid
Passive
stacks
multiplicatively
with
Mastermind
.
This
item
is
named
after
Eleisa
Velisker
a
League
of
Legends
roleplay
character,
as
part
of
the
Preserver's
Story.
The
miracle
is
a
reference
to
when
the
character
was
returned
from
the
void.

including
