Details
Children
of
the
Grave
is
a
single-targeted
ability.
Applies
spell
effects
as
a
single
target
ability.
Spell
vamp
is
fully
applied.
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
will
apply
a
35%

Magic
damage
will
be

.
Spell
shields
will
block
the
ability.
Additional
Information:
Even
though
Mordekaiser
is
already
healed
for
the
full
damage
dealt,
Iron
Man
triggers
as
well,
effectively
giving
Mordekaiser
135%
of
the
damage
dealt's
worth
in
health.
If
Children
of
the
Grave
kills
Karthus
,
Kog'Maw
or
Zyra
,
Mordekaiser
will
not
gain
the
ghost
until
the
end
of
their
passives.
While
those
champions
are
under
the
effect
of
their
passive,
Mordekaiser
will
not
gain
the
stat
increase
because
the
ghost
is
not
yet
alive.
Similarly,
if
Children
of
the
Grave
kills
a
unit
affected
by
Yorick's
Omen
of
Death
,
then
the
Omen
will
trigger
first,
and
Mordekaiser
will
not
gain
the
bonus
stats
until
it
ends.
If
Children
of
the
Grave
kills
a
target
protected
by
Zilean's
Chrono
Shift
,
Zac's
Cell
Division
,
or
Guardian
Angel's
passive,
the
Children
of
the
Grave
debuff
is
removed
and
Mordekaiser
will
no
longer
gain
the
effects.
The
ghost
does
not
disappear
when
the
corresponding
champion
respawns,
or
uses
Revive
.
That
means
a
champion
and
his
ghost
can
exist
simultaneously,
and
potentially
fight
each
other.
While
in
stasis
from
effects
such
as
Zhonya's
Hourglass
or
Chrono
Shift
,
Mordekaiser
cannot
issue
commands
to
his
ghost.
His
ghost
will
continue
with
its
previous
orders,
or
stand
idle
if
it
has
none.
Children
of
the
Grave's
debuff
can
be
removed
with
Quicksilver
.
