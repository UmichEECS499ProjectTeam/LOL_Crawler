Notes
The
slows
from
items
will
not
stack
with
each
other.
(i.e.
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
does
not
stack
with
Frozen
Mallet
The
strongest
item
slow
will
be
effective
until
it
is
expired.
Any
other
item
slow
that
was
applied
and
not
expired
will
take
effect
after
that.
The
slow
is
trigger-able
with
Smite
.
Single-target
active
abilities
on
items,
such
as
Deathfire
Grasp
,
will
apply
the
35%
slow
from
Rylai's.
The
following
will
not
trigger
a
slow:
Champion
abilities
that
do
not
trigger
spell
vamp
.
On-hit
damage
damage
dealt
by
items
.
Summoner
Spells
,
such
as
Ignite
.
Damage
dealt
by
the
auto-attacks
of
Clones
and
Pets/Minions
.
Examples
of
clones:
Mordekaiser's
Children
of
the
Grave
and
LeBlanc's
Mirror
Image
.
Examples
of
minions:
Heimerdinger's
H-28G
Evolution
Turret
and
Elise's
Spider
Swarm
.
See
the
article
for
more
details,
but
abilities
such
as
Zyra's
Rampant
Growth
are
not
classified
as
pets
and
will
trigger
the
slow
like
any
standard
abilities.
Trivia
Rylai
is
the
name
of
the
Crystal
Maiden
hero
in
DotA
.
Rylai
specializes
in
using
ice-based
crowd
control
abilities
to
disable
and
slow
her
opponents.
The
icon
for
the
Crystal
Scepter
is
almost
identical
to
the
icon
for
the
Crystal
Maiden's
and
Archmage
from
Warcraft
3's
Brilliance
Aura
ability.
