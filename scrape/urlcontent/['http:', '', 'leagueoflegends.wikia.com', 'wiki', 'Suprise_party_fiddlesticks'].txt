Trivia
Fiddlesticks
was
designed
by
Guinsoo
.
Fiddle's
original
passive
ability
was
called
"Paranoia",
which
caused
enemies
to
miss
their
attacks.
This
was
replaced
by
Dread
,
and
the
name
was
reused
for
Nocturne's
ultimate.
The
quote
in
Fiddlesticks'
background,
"Those
who
say
'you
have
nothing
to
fear
but
fear
itself'
have
not
yet
felt
the
crows."
is
a
reference
to
one
of
Franklin
D.
Roosevelt's
opening
statements
in
his
first
inaugural
address,
"...we
have
nothing
to
fear
but
fear
itself"
.
Fiddlesticks'
dance
is
strongly
referenced
from
the
Scarecrow
Dance
in
the
Wizard
of
Oz,
since
they
are
both
"scarecrows"
in
a
way.
Fiddlesticks'
passive
is
one
of
the
few
passives
in
the
category
of
"does
damage
or
makes
damage
dealt
do
more
damage"
that
does
not
scale
with
level,
time
or
stats.
Quotes
Fiddlesticks'
joke
is
most
likely
a
reference
to
the
Scarecrow
from
the
Wizard
of
Oz
.
Skins
Pumpkinhead
Fiddlesticks
resembles
the
traditional
Halloween
jack-o-lantern
and
scarecrow
decoration.
The
skin
may
also
be
a
depiction
of
the
head
replacement
used
by
the
Headless
Horseman
from
The
Legend
of
Sleepy
Hollow
.
The
Union
Jack
on
Union
Jack
Fiddlesticks
is
the
traditional
flag
of
the
United
Kingdom.
Fiddle
Me
Timbers
is
a
reference
to
the
pirate
quote
"Shiver
me
timbers"
and
a
reference
to
real-life
pirate
Edward
Teach/Blackbeard
.
Teach
believed
more
in
intimidation
than
anything
else,
and
used
his
image
to
strike
fear
onto
others,
much
like
Fiddlesticks.
Fiddlesticks'
Classic
Skin
artwork
was
used
as
a
background
for
Ed's
computer
in
the
2011
film
Fright
Night
.
[1]
Surprise
Party
Fiddlesticks
was
released
to
celebrate
Riot's
2nd
birthday
on
27
October
2011.
It
is
the
first
skin
to
be
given
new
ability
icons.
It
is
also
the
first
legendary
skin
to
cost
975
.
It
was
originally
conceived
by
players
,
mainly
GreenEyedMonster,
Extra
Pistol
and
Mr.D,
who
all
received
the
skin
for
free.
In
early
2012,
the
Classic
artwork
of
Fiddlesticks
was
replaced
by
the
Chinese
Classic
artwork,
as
well
as
those
of
Alistar
,
Galio
,
and
Malzahar
.
