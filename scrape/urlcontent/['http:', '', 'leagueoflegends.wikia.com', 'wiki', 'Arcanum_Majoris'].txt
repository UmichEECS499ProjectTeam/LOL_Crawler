Sales
Sales
will
occur,
where
3
Champions
and
3
Champion
Skins
will
have
their
RP
cost
halved
(292
RP
for
595
RP
and
487
RP
for
975
RP
Champions
and
Skins).
The
sale
will
last
for
3
days
then
a
new
sale
will
occur.
There
have
been
occasions
where
a
sale
will
intend
to
last
longer
than
3
days
and/or
have
more
than
3
Champions/Skins
on
sale.
Note
that
if
a
particular
Region
is
undergoing
some
technical
issues
or
a
Beta,
the
sale's
duration
will
increase.
However,
if
the
Region
had
a
Beta,
which
caused
Sales
to
not
occur.
A
Sale
will
be
held
when
the
Beta
is
over,
where
all
the
Champions
and
Skins
that
were
missed
will
be
on
sale.
This
occurred
on
the
Russia
Region,
where
a
Beta
was
in
progress
and
not
allowing
the
purchase
of
Champions
and
Skins
at
lower
price,
but
when
the
Beta
ended,
all
the
Champions
and
Skins
missed
were
on
sale.
Refund
To
Use
the
Refund
System
Visit
the
"Purchases"
tab
of
the
League
of
Legends
Client
Store.
On
the
left
side
of
the
screen,
you
will
see
your
remaining
refund
credits
(tokens).
On
the
far
right
under
"Action,"
select
the
"Refund"
button.
When
the
popup
appears,
confirm
that
you
want
to
spend
one
of
your
three
allotted
credits.
Please
note
that
the
refund
system
reverses
your
original
transaction.
Meaning,
it
only
refunds
the
exact
type
and
amount
of
currency
used
to
originally
purchase
the
relevant
content.
Therefore,
a
player
will
receive
IP
back
against
an
IP
purchase
or
RP
back
against
an
RP
purchase.
This
also
means
that
if
a
player
purchased
an
item
on
sale
you
will
receive
that
same
amount
of
currency
back
when
your
refund
is
processed.
Policy
There
are
a
few
limitations
on
how
a
player
can
use
your
self-service
refunds:
A
player
only
get
three
refunds
per
account,
per
lifetime.
Once
a
player
has
depleted
his/her
refund
tokens,
Riot
will
be
unable
to
process
any
additional
refunds
against
the
player's
account.
Players
can
only
refund
Skins
and
Champions
through
the
store
feature.
For
Runes
(Stacks
of
9
Runes
or
Stacks
of
3
Quintessences
only)
,
Rune
Pages,
Bundles,
and
name
change
reversal
requests,
the
player
will
need
to
submit
a
ticket
for
Riot
to
manually
process
the
requested
refund.
If
the
player
do
not
have
any
tokens
left,
Riot
will
be
unable
to
assist
them.
Official
Refund
Policy
only
allows
refund
of
purchases
made
in
the
last
90
days
.
Players
are
not
able
to
request
refund
of
content
purchased
prior
to
that.
If
a
player
wants
to
refund
a
champion
and
the
player
own
skins
for
that
champion,
please
note
that
the
player
will
have
to
use
tokens
to
refund
all
the
skins
for
that
champion
before
they
are
able
to
use
a
token
to
refund
the
actual
champion.
