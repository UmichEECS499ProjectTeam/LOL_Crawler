Trivia
This
item
was
inspired
by
the
Iron
Solari
Conclave,
a
fan-made
forum
group
that
was
named
after
Leona
and
is
supported
by
IronStylus
.
Numerous
other
groups,
led
by
various
Riot
staff
members,
were
also
formed
and
"warred"
with
the
Iron
Solari,
but
the
Iron
Solari
were
arguably
the
most
successful.
Notes
This
item's
active
will
not
stack.
More
than
one
ally
using
this
item

refresh
the
shield
on

This
item's
active
applies
a
debuff,
Eclipsed
,
to
all
shielded
allies,
where
any
newly
applied
shield
from
other

of
the
Iron
Solari
within
the
next
8
seconds
will
only
be
50%
as
effective.
