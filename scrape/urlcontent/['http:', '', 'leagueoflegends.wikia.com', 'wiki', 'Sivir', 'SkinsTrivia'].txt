Trivia
Sivir
was
designed
by
Ezreal
and
Guinsoo
.
In
the
original
trailer
for
League
of
Legends,
Sivir's
hair
was
a
pink/red
color.
Sivir's
weapon
is
inspired
by
the
chakram
,
which
is
a
throwing
disk
with
razor
sharp
edges
used
by
Indian
Rajput
warriors.
The
weapon
is
about
the
size
of
a
frisbee
and
is
thrown
in
a
similar
manner.
It
is
capable
of
causing
decapitation,
and
if
deflected
by
a
shield
or
armor,
could
bounce
off
and
strike
other
enemy
warriors.
Sivir
was
the
first
champion
to
have
a
spell
rating
of
10.
Before
her
passive
was
changed,
the
highest
possible
dodge
chance
in
the
game
could
be
acquired
by
Sivir
with
maximum
ranked
Fleet
of
Foot
(25%
while
moving),
9
Tier
3
Seals
of
Evasion
and
3
Quints
of
Evasion
(11.25%),
and
6
Ninja
Tabi
equipped
(6
sources,
12%
each).
This
gave
her
a
final
dodge
modifier
of
approximately
30.91
(69.09%
of
attacks
are
dodged).
However,
the
dodge
chance
stat
has
since
been
removed
from
the
game.
Sivir
is
the
second
champion
to
feature
two
champion
spotlights
due
to
significant
changes
to
her
kit,
the
others
being
Ezreal
,
Lee
Sin
,
and
Karma
.
Sivir
was
one
of
the
first
six
characters
designed,
along
with
Singed
,
Annie
,
Sion
,
Twisted
Fate
and
Lee
Sin
.

Skins
Classic
Sivir's
art
has
been
reworked
twice.
Warrior
Princess
Sivir
is
a
reference
to
Xena,
the
Warrior
Princess
.
Both
Sivir
and
Xena
carry
a
Chakram-style
weapon,
and
share
a
similar
background.
Spectacular
Sivir
is
a
reference
to
the
DC
Comics
heroine
Wonder
Woman
.
Bandit
Sivir's
weapon
bears
a
strong
resemblance
to
the
glaive
from
the
80's
movie
Krull
.
Huntress
Sivir
is
one
of
the
few
skins,
along
with
Goth
Annie
and
Silver
Kayle
,
which
is
exclusive
to
a
Champions
Pack.
PAX
Sivir
is
a
reference
to
the
Tron
franchise
in
which
disc
warriors
fought
in
gladiator-style
battles.
Relations
Sivir
is
listed
as
Nasus's
friend
and
Cassiopeia's
rival.
