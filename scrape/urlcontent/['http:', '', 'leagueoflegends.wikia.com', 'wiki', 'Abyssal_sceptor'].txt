Strategy
Abyssal
Scepter's
aura
can
be
helpful
in
a
variety
of
situations,
not
all
of
which
are
immediately
obvious.
It
is
especially
powerful
for
melee
champions
and
short-ranged
casters,
who
are
exceptional
at
close
combat
to
the
enemy
and
deal
considerable
amounts
of
magic
damage.
With
proper
maneuvering,
these
characters
can
apply
the
debuff
to
the
entire
enemy
team
at
once,
securing
kills
for
longer-ranged
champions.
The
debuff
also
affects
minions
and
monsters
,
except
for
the
Dragon
,
Baron
Nashor
and
Vilemaw
.
The
icon
indicating
the
debuff
aura
often
appears
before
the
enemy
who
carries
it.
If
an
enemy
is
standing
in
a
nearby
brush
or
just
over
a
wall,
the
debuff
icon
may
give
them
away
even
if
they
cannot
be
seen.
The
aura
will
remain
present
even
while
using
Zhonya's
Hourglass
.
