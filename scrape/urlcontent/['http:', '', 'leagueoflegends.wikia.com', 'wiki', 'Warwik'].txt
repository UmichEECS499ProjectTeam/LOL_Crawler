Ability
Details
Eternal
Thirst
is
a
passive
ability
that
grants

an
on-hit
effect

will
apply
other
on-hit
effects
and
can

strike
as
normal.
The
bonus

Thirst
can
not
critically
strike.
PENDING

Eternal
Thirst's
relationship
with

yet
to
be
tested.

The
healing
portion
is
independent
from

heal
is
always
the
same
regardless
of
the
damage
dealt
to
the

Ability
Details
Infinite

is
a
targeted

blink
ability.
Spelleffects
PENDING
FOR
TEST
None
of
Infinite
Duress's
strikes
can
critically
strike.
If
Warwick
is
blinded
before
casting
Infinite
Duress,
all
of
his
strikes
will
miss.
All
the
strikes
can
be
dodged
.
PENDING
FOR
TEST
Infinite
Duress's
relationship
with
parry
,
block
and
blind
(if
he's
blinded
when
already
channeling)
has
yet
to
be

PENDING
FOR
TEST
Additional
Information:
The
lifesteal
from
Infinite
Duress
affects
magic
damage
on-hit
effect
items
such
as
Nashor's
Tooth
or
Wit's
End
,
unlike
normal
lifesteal.
It
is
uncertain
whether
additional
lifesteal
stacks
and
works
alike
with
the
30%
lifesteal
from
this
ability.
Including
Eternal
Thirst
's
damage,
Infinite
Duress
will
deal
a
total
of
332.

magic
damage.
This
is
assuming
you
take
ranks
in
Infinite
Duress
at
level
6,
11
and
16.
All
the
strikes
have
the
potential
to
trigger
and
apply
Spellblade
but
will
only
hit
once
because
of
the
internal
cooldown
of
this
item.
It's
impossible
to
use
Zhonya's
Hourglass
's
active
invulnerability
during
Infinite
Duress
.
Infinite
Duress
still
causes
enemies
to
be
suppressed
and
take
damage
even
if
they
Flash
away,
as
long
as
Warwick
leapt
towards
them.
Warwick
will
continue
to
deal
damage
and
suppress
the
enemy
even
if
the
target
is
moved
from
blinks
and
knockbacks.
