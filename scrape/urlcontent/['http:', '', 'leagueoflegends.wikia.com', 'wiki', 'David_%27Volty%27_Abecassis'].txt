David
has
a
B.S.
in
Symbolic
Systems
from
Stanford
University,
and
was
President
of
the
Stanford
Gaming
Society
for
two
years.
While
at
Stanford,
David
worked
at
serious
games
start-up
Seriosity,
researching
leadership
and
social
behaviors
in
multiplayer
online
games.
After
college,
he
joined
neuroscience-based
market
research
firm
EmSense,
where
he
analyzed
emotional
and
cognitive
responses
to
games
and
other
media.
When
he’s
not
playing
League
of
Legends,
David
enjoys
MMOs,
real-time
strategy
games,
tabletop
games,
and
collectible
card
games.
Special
Ability
No
Time
for
Your
Nonsense
:
David
lacks
the
ability
to
hear
ridiculous
statements
or
obvious
trolling,
causing
him
to
ignore
them
so
he
can
stay
focused
on
critical
tasks.
This
ability
blocks
the
application
of
mind-affecting
slows
and
stuns
and
each
time
it
does
so
it
increases
his
movement
and
speaking
speed
by
50%
for
4
seconds.
