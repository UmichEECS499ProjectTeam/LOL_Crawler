Policy
This
page
documents
an
official
League
of
Legends
Wiki
policy.
It
is
a
widely
accepted
standard
that
should
normally
be
followed
by
all
editors.
Policies
and
guidelines
have
been
developed
on
the
League
of
Legends
Wiki
to
further
our
goal
of
creating
a
freely
editable,
clear
and
accurate
League
of
Legends
database.
Policies
are
here
for
everyone
and
should
be
looked
to
for
guidance.
Policies
have
community
consensus
and
apply
to
all
editors
.
The
League
of
Legends
Wiki
strives
to
create
a
welcoming
and
fun
environment
for
those
who
are
civil,
assume
good
faith
in
others,
seek
consensus
in
discussions
and
work
towards
the
goal
of
creating
an
increasingly
comprehensive
database
about
everything
in
the
ever
expanding
League
of
Legends
universe.
Policies
need
to
be
approached
with
common
sense;
adhere
to
the
spirit
rather
than
the
letter
of
the
rules,
and
be
prepared
to
ignore
the
rules
on
the
rare
occasions
when
they
conflict
with
the
goal
of
improving
the
wiki.
What
are
our
policies?
Some
of
the
more
important
polices
that
are
specific
to
the
League
of
Legends
Wiki
are
listed
below,
but
the
full
list
of
policy
pages

Where
do
our
policies
come
from?
Generally,
League
of
Legends
Wiki
policies
come
from
one
of
two
sources:
From
a
standard
or
good
practice
that
has
been
followed
subconsciously
for
some
time
because
it
is
common
sense
and
has
become
an
established
precedent.
From
a
deliberate
proposal
by
a
user
or
a
group
of
users,
usually
from
a
forum
discussion
.
Such
proposals
must
achieve
full
community
consensus
before
being
formalized
as
a
policy.
Most
of
the
policies
that
fall
under
the
first
category
are
derived
from
similar
practices
on
other
wikis.
