The
subject
of
this
article
was
removed

The
information
displayed
is
no
longer

Utility
Plentiful
Bounty
is
a
first
tier
offense
mastery
with
1
rank.
Effect
per
rank
Improves
your
Smite
spell
to
reward
a
bonus
5
gold
when
used,
and
reduces
its
cooldown
by
5
seconds.
Requirements
None.
Strategy
This
mastery
is
excellent
for
junglers
.
The
bonus
gold
allows
them
to
get
gear
faster.
The
reduced
cooldown
is
almost
necessary,
as
some
junglers
can
jungle
fast
enough
to
have
to
wait
for
the
cooldown
even
with
the
mastery.
The
bonus
5
gold
is
given
when
Smite
is
used,
whether
it
kills
the
target
or
not.
It
is
recommended
to
last-hit
with
Smite
to
avoid
counter
junglers
stealing
the
kill.
