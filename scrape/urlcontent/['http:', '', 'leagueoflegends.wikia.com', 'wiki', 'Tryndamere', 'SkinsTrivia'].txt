Trivia
Tryndamere
was
designed
by
Guinsoo
.
Tryndamere
is
voiced
by
Brian
Sommer,
Who
also
voices
Willump
and
Warwick
.
Tryndamere
was
named
after
Riot
president
Marc
Merrill's
character
on
EverQuest
,
which
is
also
his
forum
and
summoner
name.
According
to
an
unused
quote
of
the
in-game
announcer
,
Tryndamere
was
modeled
after
a
picture
of
Marc
Merrill
wearing
only
a
kilt.
He
previously
held
the
title
"The
Dark
Champion",
but
since
the
second
official
trailer,
he
now
holds
the
title
"The
Barbarian
King".
In
the
August
31st
2010
edition
of
The
Journal
of
Justice
,
it
was
written
that
Tryndamere
was
passed
down
his
sword
from
his
father,
who
had
it
passed
down
from
his
father
before
him,
and
so
on.
Tryndamere
said
his
father's
words
of
wisdom
were
"master
using
it
and
you
can
have
this"
-
a
quote
from
the
original
Legend
of
Zelda
on
the
Nintendo
Entertainment
System,
released
in
1987.
Tryndamere
has
strong
similarities
to
Conan
the
Barbarian
.
His
previous
story
appears
to
have
been
based
off
of
the
opening
sequence
of
the
1982
"Conan
the
Barbarian"
movie,
in
which
Conan's
entire
village
is
slaughtered
and
he
swears
revenge
upon
those
who
destroyed
it.
In
the
original
stories,
Conan
is
said
to
have
come
from
a
nomadic
people
of
the
far
north
of
his
world,
while
Tryndamere
comes
from
the
Northern
Freljord.
Conan
is
said
to
have
"become
a
king
by
his
own
hand"
in
the
1982
movie.
Tryndamere
became
the
Barbarian
King
by
uniting
all
the
Barbarians
of
his
homeland
under
his
leadership,
thanks
to
his
friendships
with
most
of
the
Barbarian
leaders.
Tryndamere's
dance
refers
to
Hopak
,
the
traditional
Cossack
dance.
His
previous
dance,
before
patch
V1.0.0.122
,
was
a
reference
from
N'Sync's
dance
in
their
song,
Bye
Bye
Bye.
A
side-by-side
comparison
can
be
seen
here
.
Tryndamere
was
the
first
champion
to
have
an
attack
rating
of
100.
According
to
Aatrox's
lore,
Tryndamere
could
possibly
be
from
the
Magelord
clan,
as
they
were
the
clan
that
was
decimated.
This
is
unlikely,
since
the
story
of
the
Protectorate
and
the
Magelord
was
the
oldest
known
story
of
Aatrox,
who
is
many
centuries
older
than
Tryndamere
is.
Quotes
Tryndamere's
quote
"I
am
your
worst
nightmare!"
is
a
popular
trope
used
in
films,
video
games,
literature,
music
and
TV.
It
may
also
be
an
inside
joke
for
Marc
Merrill
being
the
"worst
nightmare"
of
his
employees.
Skins
King
Tryndamere
skin
is
a
reference
to
his
marriage
to
Ashe
and
becoming
the
King
of
Freljord
.
Highland
Tryndamere
skin
is
a
reference
to
the
Highlander
franchise.
"Highland"
is
also
an
old
term
referring
to
people
from
the
Scottish
Highlands.
So,
Highland
Tryndamere
is
actually
more
likely
to
be
a
reference
to
the
old
Scottish
warrior
garb
than
to
the
Highlander
franchise.
Attendees
of
the
Season
One
Championship
at
Dreamhack
qualified
for
a
code
to
unlock
Viking
Tryndamere
.
All
others
were
able
to
purchase
the
skin
from
the
League
of
Legends
store
on
24
June
2011
for
975
.
The
Demonblade
Tryndamere
trailer
can
be
seen
here
.
This
skin
is
possibly
a
reference
to
Nightmare
from
the
Soul
Calibur
series.
This
skin
also
bears
a
resemblance
to
Haru
Glory
from
the
Rave
Master
series.
One
of
Haru's
swords
claims
the
soul
of
the
wielder
in
exchange
for
greatly
increased
strength.
During
the
process,
the
sword
will
fuse
with
the
wielder's
arm.
His
nemesis
in
the
lore,
an
enigmatic
figure
with
a
"cruel,
living
sword"
is
similar
to
this
skin.
Tryndamere
was
the
first
champion
to
have
a
non-comical
Legendary
skin
voice-over,
followed
by
Vladimir
,
Cho'Gath
,
Galio
,
Nocturne
and
Anivia
.
Sultan
Tryndamere
is
a
commemorative
skin
created
to
celebrate
the
launch
of
League
of
Legends
in
Turkey.
Tryndamare
shares
his
Sultan
skin
with
Gangplank
.
Warring
Kingdoms
Tryndamere
is
a
reference
to
Guan
Yu
from
Romance
of
the
Three
Kingdoms
.
Tryndamere
shares
the
Warring
Kingdoms
skin
with
Jarvan
IV
and
Xin
Zhao
.
Tryndamere's
sword
in
this
skin
also
bears
a
resemblance
to
the
head
of
Guan
Yu's
Green
Dragon
Crescent
Blade.
In
comparison
to
the
characters
the
three
aforementioned
are
based
off
of
from
Koei's
Dynasty
Warriors
series
(Tryndamere
to
Guan
Yu,
Jarvan
to
Lu
Bu,
and
Xin
Zhao
to
Zhao
Yun),
coincidentally,
Guan
Yu
himself
out
of
the
three
is
also
featured
the
MOBA
Smite,
along
with
the
original
Sun
Wukong
(Guan
Yu
and
Wukong
also
being
of
the
many
characters
featured
in
Koei
titles).
Relations
Tryndamere
is
married
to
Ashe
.
However,
Ashe
says
that
they
married
for
political
purposes
and
not
romantic.
Tryndamere's
nemesis
in
his
lore
is
Aatrox
.
Tryndamere
is
also
hostile
towards
the
Winter's
Claw,
who's
disdain
towards
Avarosa's
decandent
lifestyle
clashes
with
their
harsh
nomadic
ways.
