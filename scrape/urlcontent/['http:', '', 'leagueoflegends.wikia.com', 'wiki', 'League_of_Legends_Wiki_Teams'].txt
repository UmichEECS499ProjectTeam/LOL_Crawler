Redirected

League

Wiki
Teams
The
teams
have
already
been
formed
on
the
following
blog:
LoL
Wiki
Teams
Part
2
.
If
you
haven't
joined
one
team
yet,
you
still
have
time
to
apply
to
one
of
the
teams
there
or
even
submit
your
own
Team
idea
(Zaun,
Piltover,
etc.)
on
the
blog
mentioned
above.
Each
type
of
page
has
a
point
reward
that
will
be
divided
among
the
teams
that
helped
improved
the
page
if
the
participants
followed
the
rules:
Rules:
To
compete
on
this
contest,
you
(as
an
individual
team
member)
can
go
to
a
page
and
claim
it
as
yours,
by
leaving
a
message
on
the
comments
that
says
"Property
of
Team
(Ionia/Demacia/Noxus),
signed
(Your
username)".
This
will
give
you
a
two
hour
window
of
opportunity
in
which
only
YOU
will
be
able
to
edit
that
page
and
improve
it,
and
take
points
for
it.
Please
don't
forget
to
leave
a
Summary
that
states
"Courtesy
of
Team
(Ionia/Noxus/Demacia).
This
will
be
needed
to
get
points
for
the
edit.
(If
you
forgot
to
leave
that
summary,
just
edit
it
again
with
something
minor
and
leave
the
summary,
this
will
give
you
points
for
that
too).
Remember
that
the
wikia
system
doesn't
really
recognize
that
claim,
so
don't
get
mad
if
an
user
edits
the
page
while
it
is
claimed
by
not
knowing
about
it.
For
the
same
reason,
be
sure
to
check
the
comments
and
make
sure
that
the
page
is
not
claimed
when
you
start
editing
(and
claiming
it).
If
you
find
that
those
two
hours
are
not
enough,
you
can
claim
it
again
before
the
window
has
passed
to
refresh
the
claim
duration.
There
can
only
be
one
claim
per
individual
team
member
at
any
given
time.
If
you
have
finished
editing
your
page
and
you
want
to
start
editing
another.
Edit
your
comment
of
the
first
claim
to
end
it,
and
only
then
you
can
claim
another
page.
Important:
Take
note
of
the
pages
you
have
edited
and
leave
a
comment
below
with
a
list
of
them,
if
you
want
them
to
be
taken
into
account
for
this
period.
You
can
edit
your
comment
to
add
to
the
list,
don't
make
a
new
comment.
The
points
will
be
awarded
at
the
end
of
the
contest
period.
If
more
than
one
team
improved
one
page,
the
points
will
be
divided
between
them
to
a
proportion
of
how
good
the
improvement
was.

Improvement
Objectives
We
need
to
prepare
for
the
coming
of
the
Dominion
Game
Mode,
and
so
we
need
to
make
all
of
our
pages
great
and
ready
to
receive
the
updates.
Our
main
objective
is
to
make
the
pages:
Clean
Well-structured
Accurate
(some
gameplay
elements
still
have
theorycrafting
from
Beta)
Well-capitalized
and
punctuated.
(words
like
attack
damage,
unique,
passive).
They
should
be
lowercased
unless
they
are
after
a
period.
Abbreviations
avoided.
(Abbreviations
need
to
be
avoided
on
general
text
and
lists.
Tables
are
ok
with
them.
Points
per
page:
Note:Categories
mentioned
below
refer
to
editing
the
pages
that
belong
that
category.
You
should
not
edit
the
category
page
itself.
Un-touchable
pages
You
can't
claim
these
pages:
Champion
Main
pages:
Do
not
edit
these
unless
you
are
fixing
typos.
Champion
Trivia
section:
These
edits
won't
count
either,
unless
you
are
fixing
typos.
City-states
and
Places:
Do
not
edit
these
unless
you
are
fixing
typos.
Patch
Notes
(Don't
touch
it)
Each
typo
fixing
run
will
award
your
team
1
point.
Only
one
point
per
team
per
page.
