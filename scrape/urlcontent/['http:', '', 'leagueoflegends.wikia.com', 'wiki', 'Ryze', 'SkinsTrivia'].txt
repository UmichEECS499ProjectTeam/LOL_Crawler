Trivia
Ryze
was
designed
by
Ezreal
and
Guinsoo
.
Ryze
is
one
of
five
champions
voiced
by
Adam
Harrington,
the
other
four
being
Karthus
,
Kassadin
,
Mordekaiser
,
and
Shaco
.
He
was
the
first
champion
released
prior
Season
One
to
obtain
a
League
Judgement.
Ryze's
original
cost
was
1350
.
He
was
lowered
to
450
on
April
12,
2011.
The
scroll
that
Ryze
keeps
on
his
back
is
seen
behind
an
overturned
chair
in
the
Mac
Launch
preview
video.
In
his
lore
it
is
said
that
the
scroll
which
Ryze
keeps
on
his
back
is
indestructible,
but
in
the
video
"A
Twist
of
Fate",
his
scroll
is
cut
by
Nocturne.
However,
later
in
the
cinematic,
the
scroll
seems
to
have
reformed.
Whether
this
is
because
the
scroll
will
always
repair
itself
or
not
is
left
unstated,
and
is
up
to
speculation.
So
far
he
appeared
in
all
cinematic
trailers.
Ryze
shares
a
quote
with
Jinx
saying
"Zap"
Skins
Human
Ryze
is
one
of
the
four
Collector's
Edition
skins,
the
other
champions
with
this
distinction
are
Alistar
,
Kayle
and
Annie
.
It
can
no
longer
be
obtained,
as
it
was
a
pre-order
skin.
Uncle
Ryze
is
a
reference
to
Uncle
Sam
used
in
United
States
army
recruitment.
In
the
Chinese
Uncle
Ryze
art,
The
Declaration
of
Independence
that
Ryze
carries
on
its
back
is
replaced
with
other
text.
Tribal
Ryze
is
often
compared/considered
to
look
like
Zeus
,
the
God
of
the
Sky
and
Ruler
of
the
Olympian
gods,
from
Greek
Mythology.
Triumphant
Ryze
is
only
available
to
those
who
win
official
competition
matches.
The
skin
was
previously
known
as
"Champion"
and
"Trophy".
Pirate
Ryze's
splash
art
features
several
other
champions
that
share
the
pirate
theme.
From
left
to
right,
these
champions
are:
Bilgerat
Rumble
,
Fiddle
Me
Timbers
,
Bilgewater
Katarina
,
Buccaneer
Tristana
and
Bilgewater
Swain
.
Ryze
was
the
first
champion
to
have
9
skins.
Ryze
was
the
first
champion
to
have
2
Harrowing
skins,
from
2010
&
2012.
