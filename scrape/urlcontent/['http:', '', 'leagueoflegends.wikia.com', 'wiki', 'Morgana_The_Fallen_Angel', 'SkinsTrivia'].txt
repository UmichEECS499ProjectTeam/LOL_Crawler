Trivia
Morgana
likely
takes
her
name
from
one
of
the
several
alternate
names
for
Morgan
le
Fay
used
throughout
the
Arthurian
legend.
During
development,
her
original
name
was
"Morgana
Le",
which
was
changed
to
"Morgana
Hex",
and
then
simply
to
"Morgana".
Her
story,
along
with
Kayle's
story,
closely
resembles
the
story
of
Lucifer
and
Michael
in
the
epic
John
Milton
work
Paradise
Lost
.
Morgana
and
Kayle
were
the
first
champions
shown
to
be
relatives.
Morgana
has
the
highest
Attack
Damage
amongst
ranged
champions,
reaching
114.
5
at
level
18.
Morgana
previously
shared
an
auto-attack
range
of
425
with
Urgot
,
the
shortest
of
all
champions
classified
as
ranged.
Morgana
was
one
of
the
champions
chosen
for
the
Noxian
pool
available
during
the
Ionia
vs.
Noxus
match
.
Morgana
was
featured
on
the
cover
in
the
swimsuit
edition
of
Sports
Exposed,
Valoran's
leading
magazine
covering
the
competitive
sports
of
the
world.
The
Journal
of
Justice
did
an
article
detailing
this
story.
Morgana's
original
cost
was
3150
.
It
was
lowered
to
1350
on
April
12,
2011.
Skins
Exiled
Morgana
is
referring
to
her
appearance
shortly
after
being
branded
as
"fallen."
Also,
the
splash
art
shows
her
bangs
covering
the
right
side
of
her
face,
but
the
in-game
model
has
them
on
her
left.
Exiled
Morgana
was
created
by
Riot
based
in
an
idea
of
Pawige
Sinful
Succulence
Morgana
is
based
on
her
bakery
in
Noxus,
described
in
the
Journal
of
Justice
.
However,
as
of
the
3/19/2013
skin
sale
,
her
bakery
has
been
shut
down,
and
she
now
operates
a
food
cart.
Blade
Mistress
Morgana
is
a
reference
to
the
self-styled
"Queen
of
Blades"
Starcraft
character
Sarah
Kerrigan
,
the
corrupted,
mentalic
Terran
who
leads
the
Zerg
armies.
Blackthorn
Morgana
is
possibly
a
reference
to
Morgan
le
Fay
from
the
Arthurian
legend.
Ghost
Bride
Morgana
is
a
reference
to
La
Llorona
,
an
urban
myth
originating
from
Latin
America.
[1]
Ghost
Bride
Morgana
is
a
commemorative
skin
created
to
celebrate
the
launch
of
League
of
Legend's
Latin
American
servers.
[2]
Ghost
Bride
Morgana
actually
got
a
new
voice
and
quotes
but
only
in
the
Spanish
version
of
League
of
Legends
.
Relations
Morgana
despises
her
sister
Kayle
and
wishes
to
destroy
her
before
returning
to
her
world.
