Critical
hit
A
critical
strike
deals
extra
damage
during
an
attack.
This
could
represent
an
attack
that
hits
harder,
a
lucky
strike
or
damaging
a
weak
area
on
an
opponent.
Most
champions
have
different
attack
animations
for
a
critical
strike,
though
some
do
not;
this
includes
mages
and
other
champions
not
meant
to
be
built
using
autoattacks
for
damage.
Some
of
these
champions
performing
a
critical
strike
(if
built
being
able
to
perform
them)
may
instead
have
a
soundbite
that
plays
in
place
of
an
animation,
typically
a
grunt
of
effort.
Players
can
increase
the
chance
and
the
damage
of
critical
strikes
with
items
,
abilities
,
and
runes
.
It
only
applies
to
basic
attacks
or
certain
spells
like
Gangplank's
Parrrley
and
Yasuo's
Steel
Tempest
that
act
like
a
basic
attack
or
Garen's
Judgment
,
which
is
something
unique.
Critical
strike
is
valuable
for
all
champions
who
primarily
deal
damage
with
automatic
attacks
,
rather
than
through
abilities.
Some
champions,
such
as
Ashe
,
have
an
affinity
for
critical
hits
and
benefit
more
from
items
that
improve
them.
It's
important
to
note
that
you
cannot
score
a
critical
strike
against
a
building
such
as
a
tower
or
inhibitor.

Chance
Critical
strike
chance
is
the
chance
of
a
champion's
basic
attack
dealing
a
critical
strike.
Critical
strike
chance
stacks
additively
.
Runes
,
items
and
abilities
can
increase
critical
strike
chance.
When
averaged
over
a
large
number
of
autoattacks
critical
strike
chance
is
essentially
a
damage
multiplier
where
each
%
of
crit
chance
adds
1%
damage.
Thus
at
50%
critical
strike
chance
a
champion
will
be
doing
(on
average)
150%
damage
with
autoattacks,
not
counting
critical
strike
damage.
Because
of
this,
critical
strike
chance
scales
well
with
attack
damage,
in
a
similar
fashion
to
attack
speed.
The
maximum
critical
strike
chance
you
can
reach
at
level
1
through
masteries
is
20.
25
%,
excluding
abilities
and
items.
Critical
strike
chance
has
a
hard
cap
at
100%.
Critical
strike
chance
has
a
theoretical
gold
value
of
50
gold
per
1%
critical
strike
chance.
This
makes
Cloak
of
Agility
the
most
efficient
core
item
for
critical
strike
chance,
as
it
grants
15%
critical
chance
for
the
cost
of
730
gold
with
a
48.
6

per

There
is
a
known
bug

This
may
be
due
to
it
switches
the
entire
damage
into
"bonus
damage",
and
the
skill
itself
allows
critical
strike
to
base
on
the
attack
damage
portion
only,
which
may
lead
to
the
current
result
of
"Critically
strikes
without
inflicting
Critical
bonus
damage.
Pantheon's

:

Edge
)
