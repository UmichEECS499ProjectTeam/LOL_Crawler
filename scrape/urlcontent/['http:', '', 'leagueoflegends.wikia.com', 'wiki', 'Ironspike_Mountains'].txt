Landscape
Valoran
The
Ironspike
Mountains
dominate
the
northeast
corner
of
Valoran
.
They
run
in
a
rough
crescent,
from
their
northern
slopes
in
the
Freljord
to
their
eastern
extremity
along
the
coast
of
the
Guardian's
Sea,
just
north
of
Noxus
.
The
mountains
form
a
natural
barrier
between
southern
Valoran
and
the
two
city
havens
of
science,
Piltover
and
Zaun
.
The
League
champion
Anivia
has
a
nest
in
the
slopes
of
the
mountains.
Much
of
the
range
is
unexplored.
