Background
Many
of
the
data
files
required
to
run
League
of
Legends
reside
on
the
user's
computer.
Some
of
these
can
be
changed
such
as
skins,
though
skins
changed
in
this
manner
will
not
be
visible
to
other
players.
Some
data
such
as
champion
data
cannot
be
modified,
but
it
can
be
viewed.
Prior
to
summer
2011
all
of
this
data
was
found
in
a
file
named
HeroPak_client.zip;
since
then
the
data
has
been
moved
into
several
.raf
and
.raf.dat
files.
These
files
are
distributed
throughout
the
subfolders
in
the
following
directory:
<LoL
Install
Path>\RADS\projects\lol_game_client\filearchives\
Riot
released
the
format
in
a
post
on
the
official
forums
[1]
shortly
after
making
the
update.
Note
that
the
following
is
reasonably
technical
and
is
intended
for
those
interested
in
writing
their
own
RAF
unpacker.
The
average
player
may
want
to
consider
a
third-party
application
that
has
already
been
written.
Format
description
Note
that
all
values
which
are
more
than
one
byte
are
stored
in
little-endian
format.
Also
note
that
the
original
document
referred
to
paths
as
strings.
There
are
two
files,
the
.raf
file
and
the
.raf.dat
file.
The
.raf.dat
file
contains
data
for
files
(many
of
which
are
compressed
using
ZLIB
[2]
),
whereas
the
.raf
contains
the
information
about
where
to
unpack
the
files.
All
offsets
and
sizes
are
in
bytes.
Values
in
a
monospace
font
preceded
by
0x
(e.g.
0x1a2b3c4d
)
indicate
a
hexadecimal
value.
Overview
of
.raf
file
The
.raf
file
contains
two
important
lists:
the
file
list
and
the
path
list.
The
file
list
details
where
to
look
up
a
particular
file
in
the
.raf.dat
file,
as
well
as
where
to
look
up
that
file's
path
in
the
path
list.
The
path
list
tells
one
where
the
path
string
is
in
the
.raf
file.

The

uint32
represents
a

unsigned
integer.
The
^

is
used
to
denote
a
32-bit
