Jarvan
IV
Returns
to
Demacia
Crowned
Prince,
escorting
two
prisoners,
turns
away
Garen
Crownguard
Kaldera
Carnadine
reporting
from
Demacia
Prince
Jarvan
IV
orders
Garen
away
as
he
escorts
two
prisoners
into
Demacia.
Early
this
week,
the
Crowned
Prince
made
his
first
appearance
in
Demacia
since
the
conflict
in
Kalamanda
when
he
was
seen
escorting
two
Prisoners
into
the
city.
Jarvan
IV
was
greeted
at
the
castle
gates
by
Garen
Crownguard
,
who
offered
the
prince
his
assistance
but
was
commandingly
turned
away
before
the
gathered
crowd.
"His
arrival
was
completely
unannounced,"
said
Vel
Karris,
a
Demacian
guard
on
duty
at
the
city's
eastern
gate.
The
prince
reportedly
arrived
on
horseback
and
had
two
hooded
prisoners
with
him,
but
was
otherwise
alone.
He
informed
the
guards
that
he
was
escorting
the
prisoners
to
the
castle
dungeons.
"The
prince
was
very
clear
that
no
questions
were
to
be
asked."
Jarvan
IV
rode
immediately
towards
the
castle.
His
unexpected
arrival
gathered
a
considerable
crowd.
Since
the
events
in
Kalamanda,
the
prince's
situation
has
been
a
subject
of
concern
in
Demacia,
and
citizens
were
considerably
reinvigorated
by
his
return.
Despite
the
warm
reception,
the
prince
did
not
stop
to
acknowledge
his
citizens.
Garen
Crownguard,
having
been
informed
of
the
prince's
return
by
the
Demacian
Guard,
prepared
to
meet
him
at
the
castle
gates.
However,
when
Garen
broke
through
the
crowd,
Jarvan
IV
ordered
him
to
halt.
Onlookers
report
that
the
prince
informed
Garen
that
his
assistance
was
unnecessary.
Garen
protested
and
stated
there
was
"much
to
discuss,"
but
Jarvan
turned
him
away.
Garen
questioned
Jarvan
as
to
the
identity
of
his
prisoners,
and
though
the
gathered
crowd
echoed
his
curiosity,
Jarvan
replied
with
this
statement:
"This
is
the
business
of
the
crown.
Your
loyalty
is
appreciated,
Garen,
but
the
Dauntless
Vanguard
has
no
place
in
this
matter.
Stand
down."
Garen
complied
with
his
prince's
command
and
withdrew
from
the
gates.
Following
the
confrontation,
Jarvan
IV
entered
the
castle
with
the
prisoners.
Since
his
appearance
early
this
week,
the
prince
has
not
been
seen
outside
of
the
castle's
walls,
and
the
nature
of
the
prisoners'
arrest
has
not
been
disclosed
to
the
public.
"Much
of
the
weight
of
the
situation
following
Kalamanda
has
fallen
onto
the
shoulders
of
the
prince,"
stated
Garen
when
questioned
about
his
confrontation
with
Jarvan
IV.
"It
is
not
my
place
to
question
his
orders.
I
am
certain
that
Jarvan
has
reasons
for
his
actions
and
that
all
will
be
clear
in
time.
Demacia
stands
resolute
behind
the
crown."
Powerful
Magical
Disturbance
in
Shurima
League
investigators
discover
uncovered
tomb
after
detection
of
a
massive
arcane
explosion
Kaldera
Carnadine
reporting
from
the
Institute
of
War
Officials
at
the
Institute
of
War
detected
an
enormous
magical
disturbance
south
of
the
Great
Barrier
early
last
week.
A
dispatched
team
of
investigators
found
a
tomb
unearthed
by
a
massive
explosion
in
the
Shurima
Desert
,
where
the
disturbance
is
suspected
to
have
originated.
The
source
of
the
explosion
has
yet
to
be
determined.
"Magical
disturbances
south
of
the
Great
Barrier
are
not
at
all
uncommon,"
explained
League
Representative
Mycroft
Zimmer,
leader
of
the
investigation.
"But
this
stood
apart
from
the
rest.
The
disturbance
was
immense—our
detection
devices
nearly
went
haywire."
With
such
powerful
readings
rare
and
often
implicative
of
danger,
the
Institute
immediately
dispatched
Zimmer
and
his
team
to
investigate.
Utilizing
a
Piltovian
zeppelin,
the
team
crossed
the
Great
Barrier
and
arrived
in
Shurima
two
days
after
the
initial
disturbance.
Zimmer
kept
field
equipment
on
hand,
noting
that
the
detected
magical
energy
decreased
significantly
after
its
initial
spike.
The
residual
energy
was
enough
to
lead
the
team
to
the
location
of
the
disturbance,
however.
"We
flew
over
what
appeared
to
be
the
site
of
a
massive
explosion.
We
could
see
the
crater
from
a
mile
away,"
explained
Runaan
Eversky,
Zimmer's
second-in-command.
"The
explosion
wiped
out
what
had
previously
been
the
site
of
a
cluster
of
Shurima's
ruins,
but
it
unearthed
a
tomb
we
never
knew
existed."
Investigators
discovered
the
highest
concentration
of
residual
arcane
energy
within
what
remains
of
the
unearthed
tomb.
Though
speculation
amongst
the
team
is
rampant,
Zimmer's
men
were
unable
to
discover
anything
to
identify
the
cause
of
the
explosion.
"None
of
the
artifacts
we
found
in
the
tomb
tell
us
what
actually
happened
there,"
stated
Zimmer.
"But
none
of
it
should
be
taken
lightly.
The
tomb
contained
statues
with
their
arms
and
legs
bound.
We
have
not
fully
translated
the
markings
on
its
shattered
stone
walls,
but
early
reports
indicate
that
they
tell
the
story
of
some
kind
of
crime."
Zimmer's
team
returned
to
the
Institute
of
War
with
some
of
the
artifacts
for
further
study.
They
have
since
remained
on
high
alert,
monitoring
their
equipment
for
any
signs
of
further
disturbances.
"We
have
a
lot
of
theories,”
explained
Eversky.
“The
most
likely
explanation
is
that
someone
used
a
great
deal
of
magic
to
break
open
the
tomb
in
order
to
rob
from
it—but
it
really
could
have
been
anything.”
Warehouse
in
Zaun
Revealed
to
be
Corporate
Prison
Breakout
prompts
investigation
into
Priggs
Industries
Henril
Dreving
reporting
from
Zaun
An
unassuming
Priggs
Industries
warehouse
in
Zaun
was
discovered
to
be
a
corporate
prison
early
this
week
when
a
breakout
from
within
revealed
a
secret
entry
point.
CEO
Dr.
Priggs
has
since
vanished
while
rival
corporations
led
by
Edward
Manfred
push
for
an
investigation.
The
commotion
began
Tuesday
night
when
Edward
Manfred
was
overseeing
a
routine
inspection
of
his
own
warehouse
next
door.
"I
heard
an
explosion
from
Priggs'
warehouse,"
stated
Manfred.
"It
was
only
natural
for
me
to
investigate,
of
course."
Manfred
reportedly
entered
the
Priggs
warehouse
to
witness
an
unidentified
man
grappling
with
a
pair
of
guards.
"I
couldn't
make
out
much
of
him.
He
was
a
big,
grizzled
man.
He
threw
a
smoke
grenade
of
some
sort,
and
when
the
haze
cleared,
the
two
guards
were
unconscious
and
the
man
had
gone."
Manfred
was
the
first
to
discover
a
passage
to
an
underground
holding
facility
that
had
been
blown
open
from
within
from
a
dynamite
blast.
Inside
was
what
appeared
to
be
a
prison,
but
one
cell
was
empty.
The
other
five
prisoners,
however,
were
quickly
released.
One
of
the
prisoners
was
discovered
to
be
Falren
Danart,
whose
disappearance
and
assumed
death
three
years
ago
was
thought
to
be
the
cause
of
his
father's
failed
management
and
subsequent
bankruptcy
of
the
famed
Danart
Chemicals,
a
once-rival
company
to
Priggs
Industries.
With
Falren's
freedom,
however,
Danart
immediately
came
forward
to
state
that
he
was
blackmailed
following
his
son's
capture
and
imprisonment.
"Many
of
the
other
prisoners
tell
similar
stories,"
stated
Edward
Manfred.
"Most
of
them
were,
in
some
way,
a
rival
to
Priggs
or
had
wronged
him
in
one
way
or
another.
In
any
case,
Dr.
Priggs's
method
of
dealing
with
corporate
rivalry
goes
against
the
very
spirit
of
competition
that
defines
Zaun
as
a
city-state!
Certainly
this
merits
further
investigation."
As
this
information
has
become
available,
the
estimated
value
of
Priggs
Industries
has
plummeted
in
Zaun
over
the
past
few
days.
Other
warehouses
under
the
Priggs
name
have
been
searched,
primarily
by
forces
under
Manfred,
though
no
other
holding
facilities
have
been
discovered.
Production
at
Priggs
factories
has
all
but
shut
down
as
employees
are
questioned.
Dr.
Priggs
himself,
however,
has
vanished
from
the
public
eye.
"I
assume
he's
on
the
run,"
Manfred
commented.
"Most
of
his
prisoners,
including
the
man
who
executed
the
breakout,
haven’t
been
seen
since
their
release.
I'm
certain
at
least
some
of
them
were
waiting
for
the
chance
to
chase
him
down."

Senior
Summoner
Ralston
Farnsley
commenting
from
the
Institute
of
War
Summoners
,
this
week,
we
celebrate
a
grand
occasion:
the
Crystal
Scar
,
the
League’s
newest
Field
of
Justice
,
has
opened.
With
this
new
Field
of
Justice
comes
an
entirely
new
set
of
challenges
that
will
test
our
mettle
as
summoners.
We
must
learn
new
strategies
and
new
ways
to
take
advantages
of
our
summoned
champion’s
strengths—and
the
weaknesses
of
our
opponents.
Summoners,
take
to
the
Field—the
Crystal
Scar
awaits!
“I
was
hoping
you
could
shed
some
light
on
how
the
knowledge
of
Skarner's
race
will
affect
the
League's
use
of
Crystal
Scar?
If
the
magic
from
the
Noxian
and
Demacia
conflict
was
enough
to
awaken
him,
wouldn't
the
continued
and
heavy
use
of
magic
in
the
Crystal
Scar
bring
more
of
Skarner's
people
to
the
surface?”
–
Summoner
Tirion
Narson
Your
concerns
are
not
unmerited.
After
Skarner
was
unearthed
in
Kalamanda,
the
League
feared
that
the
construction
of
the
Crystal
Scar
would
indeed
disturb
his
fellow
vanguards.
However,
Skarner
has
reassured
us
that
he
does
not
believe
the
magic
from
the
battlefield
will
be
able
to
penetrate
deep
enough
into
the
earth
to
awaken
any
of
his
fellows,
as
the
magic
of
the
Crystal
Scar
will
be
much
more
heavily
controlled
and
contained
by
the
nexuses
than
that
which
was
unleashed
during
the
conflict.
Skarner’s
appearance
and
the
knowledge
he
has
granted
us
concerning
the
Odyn
Valley
did
indeed
grant
us
insight
into
something
that
has
become
a
part
of
the
League’s
newest
Field
of
Justice.
At
the
center
of
the
Crystal
Scar,
League
Field
Architects
unearthed
two
massive,
magically-charged
crystals.
These
crystals
were
discovered
to
be
connected
to
Skarner’s
race,
the
bracken.
With
Skarner’s
assistance,
we
were
able
to
tune
the
power
of
these
crystals
to
grant
champions
a
powerful
boon
for
use
in
battle
on
the
Crystal
Scar.
“I
would
like
to
take
this
time
to
ask
a
question
to
our
most
esteemed
and
newest
member
of
the
League
of
Legends
Champions
roster,
Riven
.
Rest
assured,
this
will
not
delve
into
your
past
history,
and
if
it
does,
it
is
not
my
intent.
I
have
noticed
that
your
right
hand
comparatively
to
your
left
is
much
bigger,
and
fitted
with
an
arcane
gauntlet
of
sorts.
Do
you
use
this
to
magnify
the
strength
in
your
hand
and
arm
so
you
can
wield
the
mighty
sword
you
use
once
fully
formed?”
–
TechnOkami
Since
her
Judgement
at
the
Institute
of
War,
Riven
has
kept
to
herself
despite
her
newfound
status
as
a
champion
of
the
League
of
Legends.
Though
she
has
been
the
subject
of
a
great
deal
of
attention,
she
has
been
resistant
to
responding
to
interview
requests,
but
the
Exile
found
your
question
to
be
non-invasive
and
simple
enough
to
offer
an
answer:
“The
gauntlet
does
nothing
to
increase
my
strength
by
any
magical
means—strength
must
come
from
within.
It
is
a
remnant
of
the
armor
I
have
possessed
since
my
time
in
the
service
of
Noxus.
Like
my
blade,
it
is
a
reminder
of
where
I
came
from.”
“I
am
constantly
noticing
that
Heimerdinger's
Techmaturgical
weaponry
starts
to
drop
off
in
power.
Could
this
be,
because
of
some
withering
effects
through
the
summoning?
Is
our
beloved
Yordle
mastermind
aware
of
the
slowly
constant
drop
off
his
beloved
inventions
suffer?
I
guess
it
would
be
stupid
to
ask
if
he
is
working
on
improvements,
but
I’m
hoping
for
some
insight.”
–
Master
Cen
The
Revered
Inventor
has
been
busier
than
ever
as
of
late
attending
to
affairs
in
Piltover.
The
Yordle
Academy
of
Science
and
Progress
has
just
begun
its
fall
semester,
and
Heimerdinger
is,
as
always,
vigilant
in
remaining
on
site
for
a
few
weeks
to
welcome
new
students.
On
top
of
that,
Piltover
Customs
has
seen
an
increase
of
business
as
well
over
the
past
few
weeks.
The
Revered
Inventor
hardly
had
time
to
spare
a
word
in
answer
to
your
question:
“Yes,
yes!
I
may
have
been
negligent
in
my
upkeep
of
the
devices
designated
for
the
Field
of
Justice—I
defend
that
they
are
as
effective
as
ever,
even
with
the
slightest
buildup
of
rust!
I
will
find
the
time
to
tinker
with
them
soon—yes,
soon!—and
as
with
every
tune-up,
I
will
invariably
find
room
for
improvement!”
