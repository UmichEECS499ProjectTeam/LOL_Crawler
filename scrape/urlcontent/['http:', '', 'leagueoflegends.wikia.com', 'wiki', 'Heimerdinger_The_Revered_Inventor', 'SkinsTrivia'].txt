Trivia
Heimerdinger
was
designed
by
Ezreal
.
Heimerdinger
is
voiced
by
Dennis
Collins
Johnson
,
who
also
voices
Gangplank
and
Taric
.
His
name
is
a
combination
of
the
names
of
J.
Robert
Oppen
heimer
,
a
physicist
known
for
being
the
"father"
of
the
atomic
bomb,
and
Erwin
Schrö
dinger
,
one
of
the
fathers
of
quantum
physics.
Heimerdinger's
walking
animation
is
often
referred
to
by
players
and
Rioters
alike
as
"derpy",
highlighted
as
one
of
his
unique
qualities,
as
shown
in
this
video
.
Prior
to
his
rework,
Heimerdinger
was
only
able
to
place
2
H-28G
Evolution
Turret
s.
However,
it
was
possible
to
have
3
active
by
utilizing
a
glitch
with
Syndra's
Force
of
Will
.
If
2
turrets
were
placed
and
one
of
them
was
targeted
for
Force
of
Will
,
Heimerdinger
could
place
one
more
turret
during
the
stasis.
Heimerdinger
was
the
only
champion
who
could
restore
turrets
'
health,
with
his
passive
Techmaturgical
Repair
Bots
.
As
of
his
rework,
the
ability
no
longer
affects
turrets.
Activating
UPGRADE!!!
will
give
Heimerdinger
a
buff
and
the
tooltip
reads
"Harder,
Better,
Faster,
Stronger"
,
This
is
a
reference
to
a
Daft
Punk
song
by
the
same
name.
Scoring
a
Pentakill
will
grant
Heimerdinger
the
buff,
Eureka!
,
which
rejoices
his
successful
"correction"
of
his
opponents'
living
status.
This
is
purely
cosmetic.
Quotes
His
walking
quote
"For
great
science"
is
a
reference
to
the
internet
meme
"
For
great
justice
",
which
originated
from
the
Engrish
translation
of
the
game
Zero
Wing.
His
other
walking
quote,
"Back,
you
dirty
ape,
back!"
is
a
reference
to
Planet
of
the
Apes
.
In
yet
another
one
of
his
walking
quotes,
he'll
say
"Raise
your
what
?",
which
is
a
reference
to
"ヽ༼ຈل͜ຈ༽ﾉ
raise
your
dongers
ヽ༼ຈل͜ຈ༽ﾉ",
which
was
posted
by
Michael
Santana
on
his
twitter
account.
Michael
Santana
(Imaqtpie
from
Team
Dignitas)
is
a
well-known
Heimerdinger
player.
Rumble's
League
Judgment
contains
a
quote
from
Heimerdinger,
who
insults
him
in
a
technical
manner:
"The
probability
of
your
continued
existence
is
rapidly
approaching
zero."
Heimerdinger's
new
movement
quotes,
"Aha,
42,
I
knew
it!
Now
-
er,
what
was
the
question
again?"
,
and,
"42...
there's
just
something
about
that
number."
,
is
a
reference
to
The
Hitchhiker's
Guide
to
the
Galaxy
.
Skins
Alien
Invader
Heimerdinger
is
a
reference
to
Mars
Attacks!
,
a
comedic
alien
invasion
movie.
The
skin
changes
the
look
of
his
turrets
to
retro
sci-fi
rayguns
.
Piltover
Customs
Heimerdinger
changes
the
look
of
his
turrets
to
engines.
The
skin's
art
background
has
Hot
Rod
Corki's
flying
vehicle.
Blast
Zone
Heimerdinger's
Chinese
artwork
is
used
as
an
image
to
show
that
the
League
of
Legends
store
is
under
maintenance.
Relations
Heimerdinger
created
Master
Yi's
goggles,

Seven
Lenses
of

also
created

Reconnaissance
Operations
Front-Line
