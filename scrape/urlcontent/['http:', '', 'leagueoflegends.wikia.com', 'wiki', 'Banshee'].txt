Banshee's

is
gold
efficient
when
its
healing

is
active.
Otherwise,
the
spell

must
have
at
least
a
value
of
450g.
Strategy
Main
article:
Crowd
control
Banshee's
Veil
is
a
strong
item
against
magic
damage
but
is
most
valued
for
its
ability
to
prevent
crowd
control
or
counter
poke
damage.
As
such
it
is
highly
recommended
to
build
Banshee's
Veil
when
you
are
being
focused
by
crowd
control
effects,
or
when
the
enemy
has
initiation
or
pulling
abilities
like
Enchanted
Crystal
Arrow
and
Rocket
Grab
.
Combined
with
Guardian
Angel
,
Banshee's
Veil
will
make
you
very
resilient
to
both
magic
and
physical
damage
.
During
the
late
game,
Banshee's
Veil
is
a
great
addition
for
AD
carries
because
it
can
block
important
crowd
control
abilities
(e.g.
Impale
,
Bandage
Toss
,
Rocket
Grab
),
or
in
other
words,
it
can
prevent
the
enemy
from
initiating
on
you.
Notes
If
Banshee's
Veil
is
up
and
you
activate
Spell
Shield
or
Shroud
of
Darkness
,
both
shields
will
pop
when
hit
by
an
ability.
This
is
intended
.
[2]
Banshee's
Veil's
passive
will
block
the
vision-based
components
of
Nocturne's
Paranoia
or
Twisted
Fate's
Destiny
.
Banshee's
Veil
can
negate
effects
from
active
items
such
as
Deathfire
Grasp
and
Hextech
Gunblade
.
Banshee's
Veil
does
not
negate
summoner
spells
Ignite
and
Exhaust
.
Banshee's
Veil
will
not
block
damage
from
persistent
AoE
spells
such
as:
Anivia's
Glacial
Storm
or
Nasus's
Spirit
Fire
.
Banshee's
Veil
will
not
block
passive
damage
over
time
effects
from
abilities
such
as
Brand's
Blaze
or
Gangplank's
Grog
Soaked
Blade
.
Banshee's
Veil's
passive
carries
over
to
clones,
like
Shaco's
Hallucinate
or
Mordekaiser's
Children
of
the
Grave
.
Banshee's
Veil's
Dominion
counterpart
is
Odyn's
Veil
.
Some
of
Baron
Nashor's
abilities
will
pop
the
shield.

Someone
should
have
already
remove
Banshee's
from
the
Mana
category,
as
it
no
longer
provides
any
mana
and
it
can
be
confusing
for
newer
players.

ClariS
It
was
not
meant
to
have
that
category.
Just
never
realized
it
was
never
removed.
It
has
been
removed
now.
Thank
you
for
notifying
us.
