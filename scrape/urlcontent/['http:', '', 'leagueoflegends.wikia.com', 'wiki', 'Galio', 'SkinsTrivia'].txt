Trivia
Galio
was
designed
by
rjcombo
.
Galio
is
voiced
by
David
Lodge
,
Who
also
voices
Skarner
.
His
/dance
is
the
same
as
Belle
and
the
Beast
performed
in
the
Beauty
and
the
Beast
from
Walt
Disney
.
Galio
imitates
the
lead
of
the
Slow
Waltz
.
Skins
Enchanted
Galio
is
a
possible
reference
to
Chernabog
from
the
Disney
film
Fantasia.
Hextech
Galio
has
some
resemblance
to
The
Iron
Giant
from
the
eponymous
Warner
Bros
movie,
and
some
resemblance
to
the
characters
from
the
movie
"9".
Hextech
Galio
could
be
a
reference
to
Clank
from
the
Ratchet
and
Clank
series.
Commando
Galio
is
a
reference
to
the
Imperial
Guard
of
the
Warhammer
40,000
series.
His
Commando
Skin
resembles
the
Ogryn
,
a
giant
species
of
abhumans
used
as
assault
shock
troopers
of
the
Guard.
Galio,
Commando
Garen
,
Commando
Jarvan
,
Commando
Lux
and
Commando
Xin
Zhao
share
a
Commando
theme.
His
clothes
resemble
the
attire
worn
by
Chris
Redfield
from
the
Resident
Evil
series.
Galio's
Gatekeeper
skin
is
one
of
the
legendary
skins
at
1820RP
which
was
released
on
April
23,
2012.
His
skin
resembles
Hellboy,
a
hero
from
Dark
Horse
Comics,
due
to
his
red
skin,
giant
fists,
demon
horns,
and
chonmage
hairstyle.
His
wings
are
the
only
contradiction
to
the
likeness
of
Hellboy.
The
runes
that
mark
the
arms,
also
mark
the
cards
of
Underworld
Twisted
Fate.
This
shows
a
link
between
the
two
skins,
as
Galio
guards
the
gate
to
the
underworld.
The
Skin
also
bears
a
strong
resemblance
to
bloodthirsters
from
the
warhammer
universe.
In
early
2012,
Galio's
classic
artwork,
as
well
as
those
of
Alistar
,
Fiddlesticks
,
and
Malzahar
had
their
artwork
replaced
with
the
Chinese
Classic
artworks.
Galio's
classic
artwork
was
changed
again
since
then,
however.
Galio's
Gatekeeper
skin
is
the
3rd
non-comical
legendary
skin.
the
1st
belonging
to
Tryndamere
and
the
2nd
to
Vladimir
Relations
The
yordle
who
inspired
Galio
to
carry
on
and
protect
Demacia
was
Poppy
.
