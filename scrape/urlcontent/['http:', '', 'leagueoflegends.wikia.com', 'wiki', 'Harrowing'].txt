The
Harrowing
is
an
event
to
commemorate
Halloween
festivities
in
the
world
of
Valoran
.
It
introduced
a
few
temporary
cosmetic
changes
to
the
game
(
items
,
maps
),
and
some
Limited
Edition
skins
and
runes
.
The
event
started
on
October
18th
and
culminated
on
October
31st,
2010.
In
2011,
there
was
another
Harrowing
which
lasted
from
October
19th
to
October
31st.

Lore
Each
calendar
year,
the
celestial
bodies
of
Runeterra
align
in
a
particular
astronomical
event.
This
lengthy
occasion
--
beginning
with
a
partial
eclipse
on
the
18th
of
October
and
culminating
in
a
full
solar
eclipse
on
the
31st
of
October
--
is
of
one
of
the
most
significant
holidays
in
Valoran
.
The
alignment
occurs
annually
around
the
time
of
the
harvest,
and
is
known
as
the
Harrowing
due
to
its
dusky
setting.
For
obvious
reasons,
the
occasion
is
marked
by
superstitions
surrounding
the
world's
dark
denizens,
creepy
crawlies,
and
things
that
generally
go
bump
in
the
night.
While
rural
folks
still
believe
that
this
is
a
time
of
great
foreboding,
most
of
Valoran
has
taken
to
commemorating
the
Harrowing
through
a
bit
of
good,
clean
fun.
Citizens
of
the
city-states
don
monstrous
costumes
and
exchange
holiday
sweets
with
one
another
as
part
of
the
revelry.
Large
costume
parties,
where
patrons
wear
either
light
or
dark
costumes
(with
the
intention
of
either
warding
off
or
confusing
evil)
are
quite
popular,
and
those
of
opposite
colors
are
encouraged
to
exchange
gifts
with
one
another.
However
they're
celebrating,
all
across
Valoran,
spirits
are
as
high
as
the
night
is
long.
As
with
all
things
Runeterran,
the
League
is
a
major
participant
in
the
holiday
festivities.
Summoner's
Rift
is
decked
out
with
special
lanterns
to
provide
lighting
(and
a
bit
of
atmosphere)
during
any
scrimmages
that
take
place
during
the
eclipse.
Minions
are
also
decked
out
to
honor
the
occasion,
and
even
some
champions
choose
to
join
in
the
merrymaking,
donning
costumes
before
they
take
to
the
battlefield.
Additionally,
the
alchemists
of
the
Institute
of
War
brew
special
holiday
concoctions,
and
the
rune
forges
produce
special
runes
for
summoners
who
display
valor
during
this
time.

Champion
Skins
Harrowing
Champion
Skins
have
been
released
for
a
various
League
favorites
since
2010.
The
first
groups
of
Harrowing
skins
began
as
limited
edition
only,
meaning
once
they
left
the
store
they
were
not
coming
back
in
the
future.
More
recently
Harrowing
skins
have
been
made
Legacy,
meaning
after
they
leave
the
store
at
the
end
of
the
event
there
is
a
chance
they
might
come
back
in
the
future
for
a
limited
time.
Limited
Skins
to
Legacy
From
League
of
Legends's
dramatic
increase
in
its
community,
the
the
harrowing
skins
that
were
originally
released
as
limited
edition
were
changed
to
Legacy
skins
in
October
2013
and
put
back
on
sale
during
the
year's
holiday
event.
Riot
stated
that
the
...
overwhelming
player
feedback
has
been
that
this
creates
an
extremely
negative
experience
for
players
who
cannot
acquire
their
favorite
skin
for
their
favorite
champion.
We
believe
that
skins
should
be
more
about
self-expression
and
fun
than
exclusivity,
so
we
are
rereleasing
them
in
a
limited
way
―

Veteran
Player
Compensation
As
the
value
of
exclusivity
will
lower
in
the
process
of
bringing
back
the
limited
edition
skins,
Riot
is
giving
compensation
to
the
veteran
players
that
originally
bought
the
holiday
skins
in
2010
and
2011.
They
are
gifting
RP
equal
to
the
cost
of
the
skins
they
purchased,
giving
Vintage
treatment
to
the
loading
screen
of
those
Harrowing
skins
as
well
as
an
giving
those
players
an
exclusive
summoner
icon.

The
Summoner's
Rift
was
replaced
with
a
seasonal
variant
that
includes
many
Harrowing
holiday
elements.
It
also
contains
Easter
Eggs:
To
the
right
of
the
blue
team's

is
a

surrounded
by
green

Urf

(complete

will
appear
when
a

the
gravestone.

Bringing
Warwick
over

the
Urf
skin
prompts
Urf's
Ghost
to
throw
his
spatula
at
Warwick
and
shake
his
head,

The

has
3
coffins,
containing
the
rumoured
heroes
Averdrian
,
Plant

,
and
the
Voodoo
Shaman
.
This
could
be
interpreted
as
a
"nail-in-the-coffin"
confirming
their
cancellation.
