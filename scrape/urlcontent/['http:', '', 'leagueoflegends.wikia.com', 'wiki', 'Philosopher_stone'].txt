Notes
Because
the
Favor
passive
does
not
benefit
the
player
who
gets
the
last
hit
,
Nomad's
Medallion
is
best
built
on
supports
who
plan
on
spending
a
lot
of
time
in-lane
.
On
Summoner's
Rift
,
assuming
Nomad's
Medallion
's
user
is
within
range
of
all
minion
deaths
in
a
lane,
it
provides
8.
3
gold
per
10
seconds
before
the
35-minute
mark.
After

it
provides

Nomad's
