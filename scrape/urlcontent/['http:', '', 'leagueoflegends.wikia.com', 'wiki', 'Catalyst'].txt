For
the
item
to
be
considered
100%
gold
efficient,
the
passive
would
need
to
have
a
gold
value
of
67g.

Ages
Strategy
With
the
increased
durability
and
sustainability
it
provides,
Catalyst
the
Protector
allows
champions
to
remain
in
their
lanes
longer
without
needing
to
recall
.
Champions
at
higher
levels
require
more
experience
to
level
up,
making
this
item
less
effective
at
providing
sustainability
at
later
stages
of
the
game.
Trivia
The
word
Catalyst
means
something
or
someone
that
precipitates
or
causes
an
event
to
happen
without
being
used
up
itself,
possibly
referring
to
the
passive
effect
that
causes
massive
regeneration
whenever
a
champion
gains
a
level.
