Anivia,
The
Cryophoenix
Rebirth
(Innate)
When
taking
fatal
damage,
Anivia
will
revert
into
an
egg
from
which
she
will
be
gloriously
reborn.
Flash
Frost
(Q)
Anivia
calls
forth
a
piercing
lance
of
ice
that
flies
towards
her
target,
damaging
and
slowing
anyone
in
its
path.
After
a
long
flight
the
shard
will
explode,
damaging
and
stunning
enemies
in
a
small
area.
Anivia
may
prematurely
explode
the
missile
if
she
chooses.
Crystallize
(W)
Anivia
summons
a
wall
of
ice
that
blocks
all
movement.
Frostbite
(E)
Anivia
blasts
her
target
with
a
freezing
wind.
This
spell
does
double
damage
to
anyone
affected
by
an
ice
effect.
Glacial
Storm
(Ultimate)
Anivia
creates
a
swirling
vortex
of
ice
and
hail,
damaging
enemies
in
a
large
area
and
slowing
their
movement
and
attack
speed.
This
spell
is
a
toggle
ability.

Shell
(Innate)
Rammus

(Q)
Rammus
rolls
into
a
ball
accelerating
towards
his

Upon
impact,
he
deals
magic
damage
to
nearby
foes,
knocking
them
back
and
slowing
them.
Defensive
Ball
Curl
(W)
For
a
short
duration,
Rammus
goes
into
a
defensive
stance
resulting
in
massively
increased
armor
and
reflective
damage
to
attackers.
Puncturing
Taunt
(E)
Because
his
foes
are
often
in
the
habit
of
running
away,
Rammus
has
developed
the
means
with
which
to
force
them
to
attack
him
for
a
short
duration,
and
reduces
their
armor
for
the
duration.
