The
subject
of
this
article

Scout
is
a
second
tier
utility
mastery
with
1
rank.
Effect
Increases
vision
range
of
wards
by
5%.
Requirements
Requires
4
points
in
Utility.
Strategy
It
is
recommended
for
jungler/support
champions
that
place
more
wards
throughout
the
game.
The
increased
vision
range
is
minimal;
better
ward
placement
will
have
a
much
greater
effect.
Notes
Only
your
wards'
vision
ranges
are
increased,
not
your
allies'
wards.
It
does
affect
the
ward
made
by
Wriggle's
Lantern
.
The
increased
vision
will
only
affect
wards,
it
won't
apply
to
Shaco's
Jack
In
The
Box
,
Heimerdinger's
H-28G
Evolution
Turret
,
Teemo's
Noxious
Trap
,
or
Maokai's
Sapling
Toss
.
Teemo
is
visible
in
the
mastery
icon.
