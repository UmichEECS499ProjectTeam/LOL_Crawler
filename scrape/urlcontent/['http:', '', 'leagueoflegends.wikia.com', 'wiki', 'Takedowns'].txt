You
can
help
the

of
Legends
Wiki
by
casting
Wild
Growth
on
it
so
it
isn't
as
small
as
a
yordle.
A
takedown
is
a
champion
kill,
assist
or
a
turret
kill
that
a
champion
attains
in
League
of
Legends
.
Takedown
grant
the
champion
gold,
and
are
recorded
on
the
summoner's
statistics,
found
on
the
summoner's
profile
.
Takedowns
and
the
medals
they
award
(shown
below)
on
a
summoner's
profile
can
be
used
to
roughly
judge
a
summoner's
skill
or
experience
level.
However,
takedowns
cannot
be
used
to
accurately
determine
a
player's
skill
or
experience.
This
is
because:
Support
champions
may
earn
assists
that
count
towards
their
takedowns,
but
they
may
not
get
as
many
as
a
carry
or
other
player
on
a
team.
Junglers
may
earn
fewer
kills
and/or
assists
early-game,
as
they
spend
more
time
in
the
jungle
than
the
other
roles.
While
the
may
earn
kills
and
assists
through
ganks,
the
time
they
spend
in
the
jungle
can
reduce
the
number
of
kills
and
assists
they
earn.
Turret
kills
are
hard
to
judge.
For
example,
if
a
whole
team
is
pushing
a
base
only
one
player
can
get
the
takedown
for
the
turret
even
though
everyone
helped.
Because
of
this,
teammates
often
playfully
compete
for
the
final
hit
on
a
turret.
