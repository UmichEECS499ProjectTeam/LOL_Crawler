List
of
channeled
abilities
Not
to
be
confused
with
casting
times
.
A
channeled
ability
is
an
ability
that
can
be
interrupted
through
specific
crowd
control
effects.
Interrupting
a
channeled
ability
is
desirable
either
to
end
its
effects
early
or
to
prevent
the
ability
from
successfully
firing
in
the
first
place.
Activating
a
channeled
ability
will
cause
the
caster
to
stop
moving
and
begin
channeling
for
a
specific
duration.
These
abilities
are
interrupted
by
crowd
control
effects
that
inhibit
casting,
namely:
airborne
,
forced
action
,
polymorph
,
silence
,
stun
and
suppression
.
Some
casting
channels
actively
prevent
the
caster
from
making
other
actions
(such
as
autoattacking
,
moving
or
casting
their
other
abilities
).
However,
this
is
a
luxury
and
not
a
rule;
in
most
cases
the
caster
is
still
able
to
perform
other
actions
but
doing
so
will
interrupt
the
channel.
Most
activatable
items
and
summoner
spells
can
be
used
while
channeling
without
interrupting,
which
is
particularly
useful
information
for
jungle
Fiddlesticks
:
as
consuming
Health
Potions
will
not
interrupt
Drain
.

were
changed
to
not

the
above
channels:
Toxic
Shot
Noxious
Trap
Deadly
Venom
Ignite
This
list
is
incomplete
Attacking
Channel
With
the
release
of
Lucian
,
a
new
form
of
channeling
was
added
to
the
game.
Unlike
previous
forms
of
channeling,
The
Culling
is
interrupted
by
attack-inhibiting
crowd
control
effects
rather
than
casting-inhibiting
effects,
namely:
airborne
,
entangle
,
forced
action
,
polymorph
,
stun
and
suppression
.
Unlike
other
forms
of
channel,
silence
does
not
interrupt
the
channel
and
entangle
will.
The
only
example
of
an
attacking
channel
does
not
inhibit
movement.

Notes
Lucian
The
Culling
0-2
seconds
Damage
is

over

at
a

proportional
to
Lucian's
attack
speed.
Charged
Abilities
With
the
release
of
Varus
,
a
new
subtype
of
channeling
was
added
to
the
game
-
charging.
A
charged
ability
has
two
activations
-
the
first
begins
the
charging
and
the
second
will
fire
the
ability.
While
using
smart
casting
,
the
player
must
keep
the
hotkey
held
down
to
charge
the
ability
and
it
will
fire
upon
releasing
the
key.
Unlike
casting
channels,
the
caster
is
still
able
to
move
freely
including
the
use
of
Flash
and
Dark
Passage
.
Charging
is
a
sub-classification.
The
forms
of
crowd
control
that
will
interrupt
a
charged
ability
depends
on
the
ability's
supertype.

or

and

if
the

is
interrupted.
Xerath

the
first
1.
5
seconds.
Half
the
mana
cost
is
refunded
if
the
ability
is
times
out.
Casting
Times
Most
champion
abilities
that
are
cast
(like
Disintegrate
)
have
a
very
brief
casting
time
that
will
interrupt
other
actions,
such
as
movement
or
attacking
(most
will
automatically
have
the
champion
continue
in
their
previous
actions,
although
some
will
interrupt
previous
actions
indefinitely).
These
casting
times
cannot
be
interrupted
except
by
the
caster's
death.
Casting
times
will
show
a
channeling
bar
on
screen,
although
the
bars
of
short
casting
times
will
often
not
be
drawn
except
on
very
high
framerates.
Champions
will
ignore
crowd
control
effects
while
casting
,
with
the
exception
of
airborne
/knockabout
effects.
This
is
different
from
crowd
control
immunity
as
the
effect
can
persist
the
duration
of
the
casting
time.
If
a
champion
is
knocked
about
while
casting,
the
skill
will
still
fire
from
the
point
of
cast
regardless
of
the
caster's
position
at
the
time
of
fire
(although
it's
worth
noting
that
the
animation
will
occasionally
fire
from
the
new
location).
For
blinks
and
dashes,
they
too
will
move
toward
the
selected
target
after
the
casting
has
finished
regardless
of
crowd
control
effects
suffered
during
the
cast
time.
"Casting"
is
sometimes
referred
to
as
"charging",
although
charging
was
assigned
to
a
new
mechanic
with
the
release
of
Varus
.
Some
notable
examples
of
longer
casting
times,
or
casting
times
that
are
frequently
labelled
bugs
on
account
of
their
ability
to
ignore
crowd
control:
