Inside
the
crystallized
pendant
is
a
small
insect
long
extinct
from
an
age
long
forgotten.
The
insect
glows
green,
emanating
an
energy
that
calms
and
focuses
the
brain
allowing
for
deep
concentration.
Strategy
This
item
could
be
bought

the

champions
that
plan
on
using
their
abilities
heavily
without

.
It
was
beneficial

purchased
as
a
first
item.
