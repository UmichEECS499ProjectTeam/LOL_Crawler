"You

The
subject
of
this
article
was
removed
from
League
of
Legends
in
patch
V1.0.0.152
.
The
information
displayed
is
no
longer
relevant
to
League
of
Legends,
but
exists
here
for
historical
purposes.
Defense
Mastery
Tree
Other
Mastery
Trees:
Offense
Â·
Utility
Tough
Skin
is
a
tier
1
defense
mastery
with
2
ranks.
Effect
per
rank
Reduces
damage
from
monsters
by
1
/
2.
Requirements
N/A
Strategy
Many
junglers
prefer
to
take
two
points
in
this
to
survive
their
first
clear
time
with
more
health.
Two
points
taken
in
Tough
Skin
enable
the
Bladed
Armor
mastery
which
synergizes
very
well.
You
will
get
the
damage
reduction
from
jungle
camps
while
reflecting
6
true
damage
per
strike
to
any
minion
or
monster
which
attacks
you.
The
downside
to
taking
this
mastery
route
is
that
these
defensive
masteries
apply
only
to
monsters
and
make
you
less
durable
during
any
ganks,
invades
or
getting
caught
counter
jungling.
