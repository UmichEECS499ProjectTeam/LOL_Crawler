What
is
zoning?
Your
zone
is
the
area
you
are
able
to
control
with
your
champion.
Zoning
is
the
act
of
controlling
your
enemy's
positioning
and/or
making
them
afraid
of
entering
your
zone.
Zoning
occurs
when
you
push
enemies
back
from
minions
by
making
them
fear
your
zone.
This
is
benificial
because
they
will
have
a
much
harder
time
funding
items
mid-
and
late-game
due
to
not
being
able
to
last
hit
minions
for
gold.
Additionally,
by
pushing
enemy
champions
far
back
enough,
you
can
even
deny
them
experience
from
dying
minions.
Both
of
these
things
together
can
be
extremely
advantageous
throughout
the
game,
as
your
opponents
can
be
both
undergeared
and
underleveled.
How
can
I
zone?
Successful
zoning
requires
your
opponents
to
be
afraid
of
being
inside
your
zone.
There
are
several
ways
to
do
this,
some
of
them
include:
putting
out
more
damage
than
them
1-on-1,
hiding
in
the
brushes
,
and
making
them
fear
a
gank
(either
from
a
jungler
or
fellow
laner
that
can
travel
quickly).
Some
tactics
are
more
effective
than
others
and
combining
them
can
be
very
effective.
For
instance,
if
your
enemy
laner
knows
that
you
can
kill
them
if
you
get
within
range,
your
zone
is
limited
to
the
range
of
your
attacks
and
abilities.
But,
if
you
are
hiding
in
the
brushes,
your
zone
covers
virtually
the
entire
lane,
as
your
enemies
don't
know
what
part
of
the
brush
you
are
in.
Certain
champions
are
better
at
zoning
than
others,
and
certain
combinations
can
be
very
effective.
For
example,
Xin
Zhao
is
an
excellent
zoner.
His
Audacious
Charge
has
a
moderate
range
and
it
slows,
preventing
enemy
escape
for
a
few
seconds.
His
Three
Talon
Strike
makes
it
even
more
difficult
to
escape
him
with
its
Knock-Up.
All
this
combined
with
decent
damage
output
and
a
fellow
laner
can
quickly
take
out
an
enemy.
All
this
makes
Xin
a
very
proficient
zoner
.
Coupling
him
with
a
Lux
can
almost
assure
a
kill
with
proper
coordination.
However,
note
that
most
ranged
champions
have
the
advantage
in
zoning
over
melee
champions.
You
can
also
zone
by
gradually
shifting
their
movement
from
one
side
of
a
lane
to
another.
This
can
be
useful
when
setting
up
a
gank.
For
example,
if
you
are
on
the
Blue
Team
(bottom
left
of
map)
and
in
bottom
lane,
your
jungler
will
more
than
likely
be
coming
from
the
river
during
a
gank
and
will
typically
hide
in
the
brush
to
wait
for
the
right
moment
to
strike.
To
increase
the
chances
of
successfully
ganking
a
squishy
or
low
health
enemy,
moving
your
champion
to
the
right
side
of
the
lane
can
force
the
enemy
to
go
to
the
other
side,
near
the
river.
This
makes
it
much
easier
for
the
ganker
to
get
the
jump
on
the
enemy.
Strong
zoners
Crowd
control
and
high
damage
output
are
the
main
components
of
zoning.
For
melee
champions,
a
gapcloser
can
also
be
very
beneficial.
Any
enemy's
sustainability
in
the
lane
can
be
used
to
counter
virtually
any
harass
and
allied
sustan
can
be
useful
to
leave
the
enemy
zoned
for
longer
as
the
enemy
will
probably
have
to
poke
back
to
regain
position
in
lane.
Some
potentially
strong
zoners
are
listed
with
explanations:
Annie
:
Annie
is
a
amazing
zoner
in
a
solo
lane,
thanks
to
her
passive
Pyromania
and
her
farming
sustain
with
Disintegrate
.
While
farming,
Annie
can
control
a
lane
by
activating
her
stun
and
coupled
with
her
bursting,
she
prevents
enemy
champions
to
come
in
her
range,
giving
her
a
good
lane
dominance.
Anivia
:
Anivia
has
one
of
the
highest
autoattack
ranges
in
the
game,
allowing
her
to
hit
her
enemies
from
afar
without
fear
of
retaliation.
Blitzcrank
:
Blitzcrank
is
an
excellent
zoner
in
a
duo
lane,
especially
when
paired
with
a
heavy
damage-dealer.
His
zoning
relies
on
Rocket
Grab
,
as
frightening
as
it
can
be
it
can
be
blocked
by
minions.
Caitlyn
:
Caitlyn
is
a
excellent
zoner
in
any
lane.
Her
main
zoning
technique
is
laying
Yordle
Snap
Traps
,
discouraging
the
enemy
from
utilizing
brush/limiting
their
movement.
If
they
do
step
on
one,
you
can
repeatedly
autoattack
for
significant
damage.
If
you
charge
up
Headshot
the
threat
of
the
nuke
will
push
most
champions
back.
Piltover
Peacemaker
does
massive
amounts
of
damage
if
it
hits.
Cassiopeia
:
Cassiopeia
is
a
very
powerful
zoner
in
any
lane.
Her
Noxious
Blast
is
enormously
strong
for
harassment.
Also,
if
either
Noxious
Blast
or
Miasma
hit,
her
zoning
capability
becomes
more
powerful
due
to
her
spammable
Twin
Fang
.
Heimerdinger
:
Heimerdinger
's
H-28G
Evolution
Turret
are
useful
for
zoning
and
Hextech
Micro-Rockets
are
useful
for
poking.
The
abilities
combined
can
easily
force
a
champion
to
retreat
under
their
tower.
Irelia
:
Irelia
's
Bladesurge
is
not
only
a
good
ability
with
which
to
last
hit
minions,
but
it
can
also
be
used
as
a
gap
closer
to
reach
enemy
champions.
Using
Equilibrium
Strike
and
a
few
autoattacks
afterward
can
deal
a
fair
amount
of
damage
will
little
fear
of
retaliation
as
Irelia
can
simply
Bladesurge
to
another
minion
if
the
ability
isn't
on
cooldown.
Jax
:
Jax
is
a
very
effective
zoner
with
his
Leap
Strike
+
Empower
combo.
Karthus
:
Karthus
is
a
great
zoner.
His
zoning
capabilty
is
great
when
duo
laning,
but
is
best
in
a
solo
lane,
where
he
can
spam
his
Lay
Waste
on
the
opposing
champion
and
deal
double
damage
if
the
enemy
is
alone.
LeBlanc
:
LeBlanc
is
an
extremely
effective
zoner
in
any
lane.
Her
Sigil
of
Silence
combined
with
another
spell
can
put
out
incredible
damage.
The
slow/snare
from
Ethereal
Chains
can
prevent
enemies
from
escaping
on
top
of
providing
even
more
damage.
When
she
acquires
Distortion
and
Mimic
,
her
zoning
potential
increases
even
more.
Lux
:
Lux
zones
well
with
fairly
high
burst
damage,
and
strong
CC
abilities.
The
snare
from
Light
Binding
is
her
primary
advantage
in
zoning,
as
the
CC
prevents
enemies
from
escaping
as
she
casts
Lucent
Singularity
and
procs
Illumination
with
autoattacks.
Renekton
:
Renekton
's
Slice
and
Dice
allows
him
to
cover
a
fair
amount
of
distance
in
a
short
amount
of
time.
Following
Slice
and
Dice
with
Cull
the
Meek
and
Ruthless
Predator
can
deal
a
significant
amount
of
burst
damage
early
in
the
game.
Although
the
cooldown
on
Slice
and
Dice
is
fairly
long,
it
is
spammable
because
Renekton
is
manaless.
Ryze
:
Ryze
's
Overload
is
on
a
very
short
cooldown
and
can
be
available
practically
any
time
an
enemy
champion
would
want
to
last
hit.
This
can
be
especially
effective
against
a
melee
champion.
Singed
:
Singed's
Fling
gives
him
a
great
deal
of
zoning
potential.
His
Mega
Adhesive
makes
it
difficult
to
get
away
if
it
is
placed
well,
and
his
Poison
Trail
can
put
out
steady
damage
at
its
higher
levels.
Taric
:
Taric's
Dazzle
has
a
moderate
range
and
is
one
of
the
best
stuns
in
the
game,
and
his
heal
can
keep
him
and
his
teammate
alive
for
quite
a
long
time.
By
himself,
his
zoning
ability
isn't
so
great.
But
when
put
with
a
champion
with
high
early
game
damage,
he
can
be
very
good
at
it.
Tristana
:
Her
Range
over
time
allow
her
poke
Champs,
her
Explosive
Shot
passive
makes
her
a
strong
pusher
while
the
active
can
shut
down
champs
like
Warwick
or
Dr.
Mundo
and
thanks
to
her
Rocket
Jump
and
Buster
Shot
she
is
a
really
hard
target
to
gank.
Urgot
:
Urgot
is
one
of
the
best
zoners
in
the
game.
He
shines
best
in
a
1v1
lane,
where
he
can
abuse
the
massive
range
on
his
locked-on
Acid
Hunter
following
a
Noxian
Corrosive
Charge
.
The
enormous
range
of
this
combo
essentially
guarantees
that
he
will
be
able
to
use
the
entire
combo
while
being
relatively
safe
from
retaliation.
Xin
Zhao
:
As
explained
above,
his
damage
combined
with
his
CC
makes
him
an
excellent
laner,
as
his
charge
outranges
a
lot
of
champion
skills
and
almost
all
auto
attacks.
Yorick
:
Yorick
's
ability
to
sustain
with
Omen
of
Famine
is
virtually
unparalleled
right
now
and
if
used
in
unison
with
Omen
of
Pestilence
can
be
ranged
harass
that
is
difficult
to
avoid.
He
can
close
the
gap
with
Omen
of
War
but
that
ability
is
severely
constrained
by
his
other
mana
costs.
