Builds
into
Dervish
Blade
Mercurial
Scimitar
Notes
Unlike
Cleanse
,
it
will
not
stop
any
other
debuffs
after
activating
it
until
the
cooldown
refreshes.
Unlike
Cleanse
,
it
does
remove
nearly
all
debuffs
including:
Grievous
Wounds
from
any
source.
The
healing
reduction
debuff
from
Heal
Ignite
Exhaust
Only
slow
part
is
removed.
Fizz's
Chum
the
Waters
Drops
the
fish
on
the
ground
Malzahar's
Nether
Grasp
Mordekaiser's
Children
of
the
Grave
Nocturne's
Paranoia
Nocturne
can
still
launch
himself
at
you.
The
vision
debuff
is
removed
only
from
yourself
and
not
from
teammates.
Darius's
Hemorrhage
Poppy's
Diplomatic
Immunity
Poppy
will
not
deal
bonus
damage
to
you.
Twisted
Fate's
Destiny
Urgot's
Hyper-Kinetic
Position
Reverser
You
won't
switch
places
with
Urgot
if
you
break
the
suppression.
Skarner's
Impale
Vladimir's
Hemoplague
Warwick's
Infinite
Duress
It
will
even
remove
Blood
Scent
,
but
only
until
the
debuff
refreshes.
Morgana's
Soul
Shackles
(during
the
stun
or
chains).
Diana's
Moonlight
Debuff
Zilean's
Time
Bomb
Zed's
Death
Mark
LeBlanc's
Ethereal
Chains
Zed's
ultimate
will
still
make
Zed
briefly
untargetable
while
he
dashes
to
his
target's
location,
and
Zed's
living
shadows
will
behave
as
normal.
However,
the
mark
itself
will
cause
no
damage
if
it
is
removed
in
the
3
seconds
before
it
detonates.
All
other
forms
of
crowd
control
While
it
may
appear
to
do
so
as
it
removes
the
visual
effect,
it
will
not
remove
the
damage
from
Karthus's
Requiem
.
Quicksilver
Sash
will
remove
almost
all
DoT
damage
from
abilities,
including
but
not
limited
to:
Blaze
,
Noxious
Blast
,
Grog
Soaked
Blade
,
Malefic
Visions
,
Poison
Trail
,
Toxic
Shot
,
and
Deadly
Venom
.
Remember
that
Quicksilver
Sash
does
not
give
you
any
lingering
resistance
after
use
like
Cleanse
.
If
you
use
it
to
remove
a
slow/stun/etc,
you
can
immediately
be
stunned,
slowed,
suppressed,
etc.
again.
The
active
is
one
of
the
few
abilities
that
can
be
activated
during
silence
or
suppression.
Trivia
Quicksilver
Sash's
name
is
derived
from
the
chemical
element
mercury
,
which
is
also
known
as
quicksilver.
