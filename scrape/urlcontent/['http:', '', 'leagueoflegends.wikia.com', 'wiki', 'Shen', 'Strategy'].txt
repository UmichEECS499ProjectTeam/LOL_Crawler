Skill
usage
Getting
Vorpal
Blade
early
allows
Shen
to
farm
well
and
stay
in
the
lane/jungle
due
to
its
heal.
Ki
Strike
also
allows
Shen
to
jungle
along
with
Vorpal
Blade
without
taking
too
much
damage.
Because
he
uses
energy
instead
of
mana
,
the
only
reason
to
recall
is
when
his
health
is
low,
so
keep
it
high
with
Vorpal
Blade's
heal.
Vorpal
Blade
is
effective
for
last-hitting
due
to
its
low
cooldown
and
rapid
energy
regeneration.
Vorpal
Blade
will
also
heal
allied
champions
that
attack
the
marked
target.
Try
using
it
on
siege
minions
to
allow
you
and
your
laning
partner
to
get
a
bit
of
a
heal
without
killing
the
minion
too
fast.
Vorpal
Blade
will
also
heal
Shen
if
it
kills
the
target.
In
laning
phase
you
can
use
the
Vorpal
Blade
to
harass
the
enemy
champion.
Be
careful
when
doing
this,
however,
as
its
range
is
short,
making
you
a
good
target.
Vorpal
Blade
and
Feint
combine
to
make
Shen
a
potential
jungler
.
With
regard
to
jungling,
Crest
of
the
Ancient
Golem
increases
energy
regeneration
by
a
fair
amount,
so
it
is
still
useful
for
Shen
.
Feint
can
almost
completely
eliminate
an
enemy's
damage
early
in
the
game.
Using
Feint
at
the
right
time
can
reduce
the
damage
dealt
to
you
by
otherwise
fatal
ultimates,
such
as
Demacian
Justice
,
Requiem
and
Absolute
Zero
.
Feint
can
be
used
offensively,
as
it
doubles
the
cooldown
reduction
Shen's
Ki
Strike
per
auto-attack.
Shadow
Dash
unstealths
enemies
it
hits,
such
as
Teemo
,
Shaco
,
and
Twitch
.
Shadow
Dash
breaks
channels
such
as
Katarina's
Death
Lotus
or
Malzahar's
Nether
Grasp
.
Failing
to
hit
a
champion
with
Shadow
Dash
can
severely
cripple
Shen's
energy
for
several
seconds,
limiting
his
capabilities.
Use
Shadow
Dash
in
team
fights
to
give
your
carry
the
upper
hand.
While
using
Shadow
Dash
,
try
to
line
up
multiple
champions
to
guarantee
at
least
one
successful
taunt.
Bear
in
mind
with
recent
changes,
hitting
more
enemy
champions
is
now
better
than
just
one
for
Shadow
Dash
's
energy
refund.
Like
many
other
dash
abilities,
Shen
's
Shadow
Dash
allows
him
to
dash
through
most
walls
in
the
jungle.
If
an
enemy
is
pushing
your
turret
,
Shadow
Dash
them;
when
they
are
forced
to
attack
you,
the
turret
will
target
them,
dealing
substantial
damage.
If
an
enemy
tries
to
tower
dive
you,
a
well
used
Shadow
Dash
can
spell
the
difference
between
life
and
death,
as
it
reduces
damage
for
the
duration
of
the
taunt.
Shadow
Dash
can
be
immediately
followed
up
with
Flash
to
extend
the
range
and
catches
an
enemy(s)
by
surprise.
This
functions
similarly
to
the
Demacian
Standard
+
Dragon
Strike
combo
which
Jarvan
IV
can
Flash
at
the
last
moment
for
the
knock-up
effect.
Stand
United
relies
on
vision.
During
Nocturne's
Paranoia
,
Shen
cannot
cast
Stand
United
unless
they
are
in
his
line
of
sight;
even
hitting
F1â€“F5
or
clicking
a
champion
portrait
on
the
left
will
not
allow
you
to
target
an
ally
until
Paranoia
is
finished.
Coincidentally,
Paranoia
from
an
ally
Nocturne
synergizes
very
well
with
Stand
United
,
because
while
the
visions
of
the
enemy
teams
are
limited,
Shen
can
use
Stand
United
to
an
ally
champion
for
a
surprise
gank.
Stand
United
is
also
good
for
helping
a
teammate
backdoor.
The
shield
protects
them
from
turret
hits
and
you
join
them
to
supply
additional
damage.
Stand
United
does
not
break
the
target
ally's
stealth,
and
produces
no
other
visible
effect.
Use
this
to
ambush
enemies
more
effectively.
Stand
United
can
either
save
an
ally
or
help
gank
an
enemy,
and
can
be
combined
with
other
global
ultimates.
Shen
is
a
very
powerful
solo
top
thanks
to
his
sustain
and
harass
with
Vorpal
Blade
,
Ki
Strike
and
can
absorb
any
form
of
enemy
harassment
with
Feint
.
Build
usage
Shen
is
a
natural
tank;
items
that
grant
health
and
resistances
are
best
for
him.
Sunfire
Cape
provides
both
health
and
armor
while
making
farming
easier.
In
a
bruiser
build,
it
is
usually
paired
with
Wit's
End
to
give
Shen
many
of
the
stats
that
he
desires,
health,
magic
resist,
armor,
and
attack
speed.
Nashor's
Tooth
is
a
strictly
offensive
item
but
it
offers
Shen
a
fair
amount
of
useful
stats,
ability
power,
attack
speed,
and
cooldown
reduction.
Thornmail
and
Randuin's
Omen
supplements
Shadow
Dash
well
since
enemies
are
forced
to
autoattack
him.
Since
Thornmail
calculates
reflection
damage
before
damage
mitigation,
it
will
reflect
full
damage
while
you
are
taking
reduced
damage.
Randuin's
Omen
can
lower
enemies
attack
speed
to
reduce
their
damage
to
Shen
as
well
as
his
teammates.
Warmog's
Armor
and
other
high-health
items
boost
the
damage
of
Ki
Strike
quickly.
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
can
be
viable
since
it
increases
Stand
United's
shield
strength,
provides
health,
and
provides
Shen
with
a
cheap
ranged
slow
via
Vorpal
Blade
.
Frozen
Mallet
is
useful
for
more
health
and
a
more
constant
movement
speed
slow
than
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
.
Abyssal
Scepter
synergises
well
with
Shen;
it
gives
Magic
resistance
for
tankiness,
a
nice
chunk
of
AP
for
his
abilities
and
a
MR
reduction
aura
that
increases
his
damage
further,
which
he
will
always
be
in
range
to
apply
effectively.
If
no-one
else
on
your
team
is
building
one
(and
you
still
have
other
sources
of
magic
damage
on
your
team)
you
should
consider
picking
one
up.
If
you
are
dealing
with
an
AP
heavy
team,
it
doesn't
hurt
to
grab
a
Spirit
Visage
or
Banshee's
Veil
in
your
item
build
(since
both
grant
Shen
health
and
magic
resistance).
The
former
grants
Shen
cooldown
reduction
and
the
item's
passive
synergizes
well
with
Vorpal
Blade
,
while
the
later
grants
Shen
a
nice
shield
to
block
any
incoming
spells
or
crowd
control
abilities.
A
variety
of
aura
items
synergize
with
Shen
.
Aegis
of
the
Legion
is
a
useful
item
to
help
in
early
teamfights.
Locket
of
the
Iron
Solari
is
a
great
choice
providing
a
couple
of
tanky
stats
with
active
synergizing
with
his
supportive
role
and
the
items
it
builds
from
make
laning
easier
and
its
active
helps
in
teamfights.
Zeke's
Herald
grants
useful
health
and
cooldown
reduction
as
well
as
a
very
useful
aura.

Countering
Beware
Shen's
burst
damage
in
the
early
game;
Vorpal
Blade
Ki
Strike
are
deceptively
powerful.
When
you
see
Shen
uses
his
Vorpal
Blade
on
minions,
Try
to
keep
him
from
attacking
the
marked
minion
to
deny
him
from
regaining
his
health.
Shen
isn't
too
great
at
killing
minions
especially
against
a
champion
that
is
good
at
pushing
minion
waves.
Pushing
him
under
his
tower
can
deny
him
minions
and
further
harassing
Shen
under
tower
can
force
him
to
Vorpal
Blade
or
Feint
and
burn
some
energy
to
sustain.
Be
careful
of
the
enemy
jungler's
ganks
and
Shadow
Dash
under
the
tower
though.
Try
to
avoid
Shen
near
his
turret
as
his
Shadow
Dash
will
taunt
you,
thus
forcing
you
to
pull
turret
aggro.
Shen
will
mostly
initiate
with
Shadow
Dash
.
Avoiding
or
juking
it
will
greatly
weaken
Shen
's
capabilities
with
its
significant
cooldown
and
energy-cost.
Be
wary
when
trying
to
kill
champions
on
low
health
as
Shen's
Stand
United
can
turn
the
fight
around
-
especially
if
the
champions
have
readily-available
slows,
since
that
will
make
simply
avoiding
them
and
Shen
after
he
arrives
very
difficult.
When
you
see
Shen
casting
Stand
United
,
quickly
use
a
hard
crowd
control
effect
(stun,
fear,
silence,
knockup
etc.)
to
ensure
he
does
not
teleport
to
his
ally.
(Note:
Even
if
Shen
does
not
teleport
to
his
ally,
they
will
still
gain
the
defensive
shield.)
Shen
can
be
hard
to
kill
due
to
his
massive
health,
however
this
makes
him
vulnerable
to
abilities
and
items
that
cause
him
to
take
a
percentage
of
his
health
as
damage,
such
as
Amumu's
Despair
,
and
Vayne's
Silver
Bolts
.
You
can
build
Blade
of
the
Ruined
King
which
deals
damage
based
on
enemy
current
health
passively.
