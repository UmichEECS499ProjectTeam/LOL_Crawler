contain
references
to
Shurelia
in

The
Journal
of
Justice
writer
Reira
Kashuld
's
name
is
an
anagram
of
"DarkShurelia,"
one
of
Shurelia's
forum
personas.
Shurelia
created
the
well-known
zoning
tutorial
video
on
YouTube.
Shurelia's
username
is
based
on
a
character
from
GUST's
Ar
tonelico
jRPG
series
Departure
from
Riot
Games
"
Trust
me
there
is
nothing
bad
that
happened,
and
its
love
all
around.
The
simple
reason
is
that
Randuin
is
going
to
be
moving
on
from
Riot,
and
has
been
presented
a
job
opportunity
in
which
we
would
need
to
move
back
home.
Since
the
commute
is
around
2
hours
one-way
with
traffic,
this
is
unsustainable
for
me
and
I
cannot
commit
to
that
much
time.
I
do
hope
to
maybe
come
back
one
day,
but
for
now
Randuin's
career
is
far
more
important
than
mine.
