Previous
weeks
Scheduling
Ten
champions
are
available
for
free
play
at
any
given
time.
Usually,
each
set
of
champions
is
available
for
one
week,
beginning
on
Tuesday.
However,
there
are
exceptions
to
this;
for
example,
if
Riot
Games
is
releasing
a
major
patch
or
new
content,
they
will
often
schedule
the
new
rotation
of
champions
to
coincide
with
the
patch
release.
[1]
Riot
also
occasionally
shifts
the
rotation
date
to
avoid
rotating
on
US
holidays.
Because
of
this,
week
9
of
Season
1
began
on
Tuesday,
September
7,
rather
than
Monday,
September
6
(which
was
Labor
Day
in
the
US).
This
resulted
in
a
short
week,
as
the
next
week
started
on
schedule
on
Monday,
September
13.
The
European
(EU)
rotation
is
generally
aligned
with
the
United
States
(US)
rotation.
[2]
Next
week's
champion
list
is
usually
released
on
Monday
between
5pm-10pm
PST.
New
champions
New
champions
were
occasionally
placed
into
the
rotation
for
the
week
in
which
they
are
released.
However,
this
was
changed
with
Urgot
,
who
was
released
on
August
24,
2010,
was
not
placed
into
the
free
rotation
until
September
7.
Riot
Games
has
stated
that
their
policy
is
to
"allow
players
to
preview
all
champions
eventually
"
[1]
,
and
it
is
generally
understood
that
new
champions
are
held
out
of
the
free
rotation
temporarily
out
of
respect
for
the
players
who
purchased
them
early.
After
that,
the
new
champions
were
free
to
play
on
the
second
week
after
they
were
released.
Since
the
release
of
Fiora
,
however,
new
champions
have
been
free
to
play
on
the
third
week
following
their
release.
Champion
types
Main
article:
Champion
Rotation
Schedule
(Season

classification
Main
article:
Champion
Rotation
Schedule
(Season
Two)#New
classification
Each
champion
is
listed
in
the
schedule
along
with
a
champion
type
(mage,
tank,
etc.).
However,
many
champions
can
be
played
in
different
ways
depending
on
the
items,
runes,
and
masteries
the
player
chooses.
(For
example,
Alistar
can
be
played
as
a
tank
or
mage).
The
types
listed
in
the
rotation
schedule
are
not
meant
to
dictate
how
the
champion
is
played,
but
to
provide
a
very
quick
and
simple
overview
of
what
kind
of
attributes
the
champion
has,
so
that
players
who
are
new
to
the
character
are
not
overwhelmed.
[1]
Every
champion
is
in
one
of
these
champion
type
"pools".
There
are
6
champion
type
pools:
Assassin:
14
Fighter:
33
Mage:
27
Marksman:
17
Support:
9
Tank:
15
Every
champion
is
in
one
of
these
champion
"epicness
pools".

Some
champions
are
excluded
from
the
rotation
because
of
balancing
issues,
although
these
have
to
be
severe
enough
to
warrant
a
full
rework
on
the
character.
Currently
Yorick
is
the
only
champion
removed
from
the
rotation.
In
the
past,
Twitch
,
Evelynn
,
and
Karma
were
removed
from
the
rotation
prior
to
their
reworks.
In
the
past,
champions
that
were
removed
from
the
free
rotation
were
also
removed
from
the
sale
rotation,
but
this
is
no
longer
the
case.
