Winning
the
hunt
The
Hunt
Is
On!
As
part
of
the
event
The
Hunt
Is
On!
,
Rengar
and
Kha'Zix
are
assigned
to
defeat
one
another
in
battle.
The
first
to
score
a
kill
on
the
other
claims
victory
(assists
count).
The
event
begins
randomly
after
Kha'Zix
has
used
all
3
evolution
points,
Rengar
is
in
possession
of
the
Bonetooth
Necklace
with
at
least
10
stacks,
and
all
members
of
both
teams
must
be
alive
for
the
event
to
start.
If
Kha'Zix
is
victorious,
he
gains
a
fourth
evolution
point.
If
Rengar
is
victorious,
his
Bonetooth
Necklace
is
replaced
with
the
Head
of
Kha'Zix
,
which
grants
him
the
bonuses
of
a
fully
stacked
Bonetooth
Necklace
.
This
event
can
only
occur
once
per
game,
even
if
both
teams
possess
both
champions.
A
video
describing
the
event
can
be
found
here
.
Notes
Bonetooth
Necklace
was
first
discovered
through
an
erroneous
update
of
the
items
page
at
Leagueoflegends.com
.
The
item
is
the
first
item
to
feature
multiple
names
and
icons.
Bonetooth
Necklace
can
gather
only
up
to
20
trophies.
Further
kills
or
assists
grant
no
additional
bonus.
Rengar
can
still
accumulate
Bonetooth
Necklace
trophies
from
kills
and
assists
even
while
dead.
Bonetooth
Necklace
can
only
be
bought
by
Rengar
.
However,
unlike
Viktor's
Hex
Core
,
Bonetooth
Necklace
can
be
sold
and
it
is
not
an
obligatory
purchase.
