The
city-state
of
Zaun
is
a
twisted
realm
of
science,
mercantilism,
and
magic
run
amok.
While
the
young
science
of
techmaturgy
does
much
to
advance
civilization,
its
research
and
use
in
Zaun
pushes
the
boundaries
of
morality
on
a
daily
basis.
Zaun,
choked
with
pollution
from
the
countless
factories
and
laboratories
that
spew
waste
into
the
environment,
suffers
greatly.
As
polluted
as
Zaun
is
above-ground,
its
subterranean
levels
are
far
worse.
All
of
Zaun's
runoff
waste
pooled
together
in
its
sewers,
mixing
into
a
toxic
and
mysterious
concoction.
A
single
plague
rat
rose
from
this
alchemical
nightmare
-
Twitch.
Unlike
his
lesser
evolved
cousins,
Twitch
became
as
sentient
as
anyone
else...
provided
they
were
as
insane
as
he.
A
seeming
byproduct
of
the
evolutionary
brew
that
spawned
him
was
maniacal
insanity,
albeit
in
a
functional
form.
Twitch
came
to
the
League
of
Legends
to
represent
himself
"as
the
only
one
of
his
kind"
on
the
Fields
of
Justice
.
Since
then,
he
has
found
a
generous
benefactor
in
the
city
that
gave
him
his
evolutionary
sentience
-
Zaun.
Twitch
is
one
of
Zaun's
premier
champions
in
the
League,
and
as
such
he
fights
for
Zaun
when
political
disputes
between
Valoran
's
city-states
arise.
Twitch
has
publicly
stated
that
his
goal
is
to
gain
enough
influence
and
material
from
his
work
in
the
League
to
try
to
recreate
the
process
by
which
he
gained
his
sentience.
While
many
challenges
lie
ahead
in
his
quest
-
one
of
the
largest
being
his
own
insanity
-
were
he
to
succeed,
it
would
mean
a
bold
and
brazen
step
forward
in
the
evolution
of
all
of
Runeterra
.
Zaun
has
pledged
its
support
for
Twitch
in
his
quest,
though
it
remains
to
be
seen
what
Zaun's
ulterior
motives
are
in
the
matter.
"The
existence
of
Twitch
proves
that
anything
is
possible
on
Runeterra."

Ability
Remake
Announcement
made
by
Classick
:
[1]
In
an
upcoming
patch
we'll
be
revisiting
one
of
our
original
classic
champions:
Twitch,
the
Plague
Rat.
Twitch's
Ambush
ability
will
be
seeing
some
changes
to
shift
him
toward
a
more
aggressive
role
on
the
battlefield.
Since
this
ability
allowed
Twitch
to
remain
invisible
for
significant
periods
of
time,
enemy
players
were
forced
to
adopt
an
extremely
cautious
and
defensive
playstyle
in
response.
Since
we
want
League
of
Legends
to
be
a
fun,
fast-paced
experience,
we
decided
to
update
Twitch
with
a
new
version
of
Ambush.
Even
beyond
its
duration,
we
saw
major
issues
with
the
Ambush
ability,
primarily
surrounding
the
nature
of
the
attack
speed
bonus
that
it
provided.
While
attack
speed
helps
quickly
stack
up
charges
of
Deadly
Venom,
this
bonus
ramped
up
over
the
total
duration
Twitch
remained
invisible.
This
forced
players
to
strike
a
balance
between
selecting
the
ideal
time
to
strike
and
attempting
to
lurk
for
as
long
as
possible
in
order
to
reach
the
maximum
bonus.
This
was
especially
problematic
for
Plague
Rat
enthusiasts,
since
it
forced
Twitch
to
forego
farming
gold
in
order
to
reach
his
maximum
attack
speed
bonus.
To
shift
emphasis
towards
a
more
action-oriented
style
of
play,
we
retooled
Ambush
to
promote
aggressive
repositioning
over
stalking.
The
first
step
in
accomplishing
this
was
to
change
the
ability
so
that
it
always
applies
the
maximum
attack
speed
bonus,
solidifying
the
emphasis
on
selecting
the
opportune
moment
of
attack.
We
also
drastically
shortened
the
duration
to
give
the
ability
a
more
tactical
context,
and
gave
Ambush
a
movement
speed
boost
to
help
Twitch
quickly
outflank
his
opponent.
Another
issue
Twitch
faced
was
an
over-reliance
on
the
enormous
damage
potential
of
his
ultimate
ability.
More
often
than
not,
Twitch's
success
or
failure
on
the
battlefield
depended
on
his
ability
to
output
massive
amounts
of
damage
over
the
course
of
Spray
and
Pray
rather
than
on
Deadly
Venom
and
Expunge.
Since
most
of
his
interesting
gameplay
revolved
around
poison
combos,
we
wanted
to
augment
this
aspect
of
his
kit
both
to
make
him
more
interesting
to
play
and
to
make
him
less
one
dimensional.
For
starters,
we
noticed
most
Twitch
players
using
Debilitating
Poison
to
begin
every
engagement
rather
than
waiting
to
build
up
stacks
of
Deadly
Venom.
For
this
reason,
we
decided
to
replace
this
ability
with
one
that
was
better
suited
to
initiating
combat.
This
new
ability,
Venom
Cask,
not
only
allows
Twitch
to
initiate
by
slowing
a
group
of
enemies
at
range,
but
also
gives
him
a
head
start
on
his
combo
by
adding
stacks
of
Deadly
Venom
to
those
caught
within
the
area
of
effect.
To
top
things
off,
while
Expunge
still
adds
bonus
damage
for
each
stack
of
Deadly
Venom
on
the
target,
it
no
longer
consumes
those
stacks
when
cast,
allowing
your
poisons
to
continue
to
tick
away.
Expunge
will
also
now
receive
a
damage
bonus
based
on
your
total
attack
damage,
preserving
its
function
as
a
heavy
hitting
nuke
even
into
the
late
game.
The
final
step
in
the
process
was
repurposing
Spray
and
Pray
to
better
support
this
new
emphasis
on
poison
gameplay.
To
do
this,
we
scaled
back
the
massive,
team-wide
damage
potential
by
making
each
missile
deal
reduced
damage
after
passing
through
each
target.
To
compensate
for
this,
we
increased
its
missile
speed
to
make
attacks
more
difficult
to
dodge
and
removed
the
ammunition
requirement,
allowing
Twitch
to
spray
poisoned
arrows
to
his
heart's
content
for
the
full
duration
of
his
ultimate.
This
allows
tanks
to
take
the
brunt
of
the
initial
assault
for
their
team
through
good
positioning,
but
still
allows
Twitch
to
douse
the
more
vulnerable
enemies
at
the
back
of
the
formation
with
stacks
of
Deadly
Venom.
These
more
powerful
poison-delivery
options
help
Twitch
maintain
a
constant
threat
level,
allowing
him
to
take
down
high
value
targets
without
leaning
so
heavily
on
Spray
and
Pray.
Abilities
