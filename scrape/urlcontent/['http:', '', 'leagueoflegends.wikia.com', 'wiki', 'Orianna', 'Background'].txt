Friends
&
Rivals
Champion
There
once
was
a
Piltovian
man
named
Corin
Reveck
who
had
a
daughter
named
Orianna,
whom
he
loved
more
than
anything
else
in
the
world.
Though
Orianna
had
incredible
talent
for
dancing,
she
was
deeply
fascinated
by
the
champions
of
the
League
of
Legends
.
This
fascination
compelled
her
to
begin
training
to
become
such
a
champion.
It
is
unfortunate
that
her
sheltered,
wide-eyed
naivete
led
her
to
take
unnecessary
and
dangerous
chances
which
ultimately
led
to
her
tragic
demise.
Orianna's
death
shattered
Corin,
driving
him
into
deep
depression
and
an
obsession
with
techmaturgy.
He
could
not
stand
the
void
his
daughter's
death
left
in
his
life,
so
he
decided
to
build
a
replacement
–
one
that
would
complete
Orianna's
dream
of
joining
the
League.
What
was
created
is
the
clockwork
killing
machine
that
Corin
named
after
his
daughter.
Knowing
that
she
was
destined
to
be
a
champion
and
seeing
the
way
the
times
were
changing,
he
created
The
Ball
as
her
pet
and
protector.
This
nearly
symbiotic
creation
uses
a
different
type
of
techmaturgy,
relying
more
heavily
on
electricity
than
clockwork.
Orianna
and
The
Ball
now
fight
as
Champions
in
the
League
of
Legends,
using
her
sometimes
misguided
morality
as
a
compass.
She
tries
in
earnest
to
fit
in
with
those
around
her.
However,
no
matter
how
hard
she
tries,
Orianna
can
never
be
human
and
there
is
always
something
unnerving
and
alien
about
her.
Though
she
attempts
social
interaction
with
other
champions
in
the
League
of
Legends,
there
are
few
who
can
get
past
her
exotic
nature.
To
many,
it's
as
if
there's
nothing
inside,
that
Orianna
is
just
a
soulless
clockwork
shell
–
a
dangerous
and
deadly
one
at
that.
However,
all
along
she
remains
the
perfect
daughter
in
her
father's
eyes.
"Dance
with
me,
my
pet.
Dance
with
me
into
oblivion."

OBSERVATION
The
workshop
is
a
disaster.
Parts
lay
haphazardly
among
the
fabrication
equipment.
Mystical
substances
and
materials
are
strewn
everywhere.
Plates
of
half-eaten
food
grow
mold
in
the
corners.
If
there
were
mirrors,
Corin
would
probably
be
frightened
by
his
own
reflection.
Disheveled,
wild-eyed,
and
manic,
he
puts
what
appear
to
be
the
finishing
touches
on
his
creation.
It
is
beautiful
and
intricate,
a
facsimile
of
a
girl
in
elegant
clockwork.
All
that
remains
is
to
give
it
life.
However,
the
enchantment
of
an
Infinity
Gear
is
purely
theoretical.
Corin
is
the
first
to
come
this
close
to
making
it
a
reality.
He
gently
removes
the
Gear
from
the
catalyst
fluid.
It
pulses
with
energy.
He
smiles
a
too-wide
smile
as
he
places
it
inside
of
his
creation.
The
reaction
is
immediate.
The
gears
inside
the
clockwork
girl
begin
to
turn,
slowly
at
first.
His
creation
begins
to
jerk,
as
life
floods
to
every
end
of
every
limb.
It
is
like
watching
a
death
spasm
in
reverse.
Corin
clutches
a
picture
of
a
pretty
young
girl
to
his
chest
as
he
watches,
tears
in
his
eyes.
REFLECTION
The
clockwork
girl
was
not
the
first
created
being
to
have
entered
the
halls
of
the
Institute
of
War.
The
Great
Steam
Golem
had
done
so
years
before.
However,
there
was
something
noble
about
Blitzcrank,
something
alive
in
the
way
he
moved
and
expressed
himself.
This
thing
seemed
dead
inside.
It
seemed
like
an
automaton,
trying
to
act
like
as
if
it
was
alive.
The
effect
was
unsettling.
Senior
Summoner
Montrose
appraised
the
thing
that
had
introduced
itself
as
Orianna.
She
reached
behind
her
back,
unnaturally
flexible,
and
wound
the
giant
key
in
her
back.
It's
not
that
she
didn't
have
facial
expressions
–
they
were
just
wrong.
There
was
something
in
everything
she
did
that
was
just
a
little
bit
off,
off
enough
to
be
just
this
side
of
completely
alien.
Then
there
was
The
Ball.
One
might
assume
that
it
was
her
pet,
but
the
relationship
was
deeper
than
that.
It
was
as
if
the
two
were
symbiotically
linked.
The
Ball
was
just
that
–
a
floating
ball,
equal
parts
clockwork
and
some
kind
of
electrical
techmaturgy.
From
time
to
time,
a
strange
eye
on
a
stalk
would
emerge
from
within
the
sphere,
examining
the
surroundings.
"I
wish
to
be
a
champion.
It
will
be
fun,"
said
Orianna,
in
a
voice
that
was
some
approximation
of
human.
Summoner
Carin
looked
at
Senior
Summoner
Montrose.
"Is
this
even
going
to
work?"
Orianna's
body
turned,
while
her
head
stayed
riveted
on
them.
"Of
course
it
will
work.
I
will
be
a
good
champion."
Montrose
responded.
"Orianna,
in
order
to
admit
you
into
the
League
of
Legends,
we
must
explore
your
mind.
We
are
wondering
if
you
have
the
kind
of
mind
we
can
explore."
Back
in
the
right
orientation,
the
clockwork
girl's
skirt
began
to
tick.
"My
father
says
yes.
I
have
a
mind.
Do
so.
If
The
Ball
is
okay
with
it."
The
Ball
chimes
and
clicks,
but
makes
no
hostile
move.
There
was
a
rush
of
what
felt
like
wind,
and
then
darkness,
and
then
light.
There
was
a
young
girl
dressed
like
a
ballerina.
She
danced
in
front
of
an
audience.
She
was
quite
gifted.
However,
this
memory
was
muted,
disconnected
emotionally.
Colors
blur.
The
Institute
of
War
comes
back
into
focus.
"Orianna,
are
those
your
memories?"
asked
Senior
Summoner
Montrose.
The
clockwork
girl
laughed.
It
wasn't
playful.
It
was
cold
and
mechanical.
"Those
are
Orianna's
memories.
I
am
Orianna.
My
father
says
so."
The
younger
summoner
looked
to
Montrose
for
his
cue.
His
composure
unshaken,
he
nodded
his
head.
"Then
we'll
try
again."
Shadows,
lights,
colors.
Someone
had
constructed
what
appeared
to
be
a
lane
from
Summoner's
Rift.
The
young
girl
was
much
older
now,
and
quite
agile.
She
seemed
to
be
training
as
a
champion.
There
was
a
tower
and
it
appeared
to
be
fully
armed.
The
one-eyed
trainer
coaxed
her
on
with
a
gruff
voice.
"Come
on,
Orianna.
Time
to
learn
how
to
tower
dive.
I've
goosed
the
power
down,
but
it'll
hurt
if
you
get
hit."
The
girl
smiled
naïvely.
She
readied
herself,
the
picture
of
agility
and
poise.
She
began
the
run
as
the
tower
fired
bolts
at
her.
It
was
immediately
clear
that
something
was
wrong.
The
blasts
from
the
tower
did
not
seem
benign,
as
they
chewed
up
the
ground
around
her.
Her
natural
grace
kept
her
one
step
ahead,
for
the
moment,
as
they
began
to
come
more
and
more
frequently.
The
trainer
mashed
his
controls,
trying
desperately
to
turn
it
off,
yelling
at
her
the
whole
time.
However,
Orianna
was
too
engrossed
in
her
exercise
to
notice.
The
first
blast
took
her
off
her
feet,
knocking
her
into
the
ground.
Winded,
she
attempted
to
get
up.
The
second
blast
wasn't
far
behind.
She
tried
weakly
to
get
up,
blood
trickling
from
the
corners
of
her
mouth.
After
the
third,
she
didn't
get
up.
Colors
blur.
The
Institute
of
War
came
back
into
focus.
"Yes,
I
died,"
offered
Orianna.
Carin,
ever
the
one
for
formality,
replied.
"We
have
entered
your
mind,
Orianna.
How
did
this
make
you
feel?"
The
clockwork
girl
giggled
in
an
inhuman
way.
"It
was
fun.
I
like
memories.
Don't
you?"
Senior
Summoner
Montrose
cleared
his
throat.
"Why
do
you
want
to
be
a
part
of
the
League
of
Legends?"
"Because
it
is
what
I
have
always
wanted.
Because
my
father
designed
me
to
do
so.
Because
The
Ball
is
impatient
to
play
on
the
Fields
of
Justice."
As
if
in
answer,
she
turned
to
pet
The
Ball,
which
began
to
crackle
with
energy.
Montrose
continued.
"And
you
understand
the
conditions
of
such
admission?"
"Yes,"
replied
Orianna.
"I
will
play
by
the
rules
of
your
Institute.
I
will
be
a
good
girl."
The
Ball
whirred
and
clicked.
Orianna
added,
"And
The
Ball
will,
too.
Be
a
good
ball,
that
is."
Clearly
uneasy
by
the
experience,
Summoner
Carin
remained
silent.
Senior
Summoner
Montrose,
however
unsettled
himself,
maintained
his
air
of
authority.
"Then
you
shall
be
a
Champion,
clockwork
girl.
The
arrangements
will
be
made."
Orianna
made
a
sound
that
supposed
to
a
girl's
squeal
of
glee
and
hugged
The
Ball.
While
it
might
have
been
touching,
it
was
unfortunately
only
horrifying.

Orianna's
ball
blueprints
There
are
many
champions
in
League
of
Legends
who
teach
us
that
--
no
matter
who
you
are
--
it’s
extremely
important
to
make
sure
that
you
have
the
right
tools
of
the
trade.
Take
Orianna,
the
Clockwork
Girl,
for
instance.
Anywhere
she
goes,
you’ll
see
her
mysterious,
spherical
pet
following
her
about.
The
befuddlement
over
Orianna’s
mechanical
pet
started
when
we
found
this
schematic
while
rummaging
through
a
few
art
department
sketches.
After
every
member
of
the
Art
Team
failed
to
identify
it,
we
began
to
deliberate
about
what
its
mysterious
origins
might
be.
While
waiting
for
the
results
of
our
highly
scientific
in-house
carbon
dating
tests,
the
greatest
historians
at
Riot
games
have
been
busily
speculating
about
its
possible
origins.
Theories
range
from
diagrams
of
a
lost
Viking
rune
stone,
to
blueprints
from
a
first
edition
Jules
Verne
novel,
to
a
discarded
schematic
from
Leonardo
Da
Vinci’s
notebook.
But
then,
where
would
the
Vikings
get
the
technology
for
a
clockwork
contraption?
What
use
is
a
mechanized
sphere
when
you’re
20,000
leagues
under
the
sea?
What
would
Da
Vinci
want
with
schematics
for
a
mechanical
ball?
After
debunking
all
these
theories,
only
one
thing
became
clear:
Orianna’s
contraption
was
no
ordinary
ball.

Orianna
sneak
peak
If
working
on
League
of
Legends
for
this
long
has
taught
us
anything,
it’s
that
when
it
comes
to
building
a
champion,
it
pays
to
have
an
eye
for
quality.
Well,
whether
you’re
a
hextech
enthusiast
or
you’re
just
in
the
market
for
a
new
watch,
if
you’ve
got
any
appreciation
for
fine
craftsmanship
you
should
have
a
look
at
Orianna,
the
Clockwork
Girl
and
her
pet
ball.
That’s
right,
we
said
pet
ball!
And
while
it
might
be
strange
to
see
a
metal
lady
walking
around
everywhere
with
a
mechanical
sphere,
we’re
willing
to
wager
that
once
you
see
what
she
can
do
with
it
you’ll
be
in
the
market
for
a
pet
ball
yourself.
Just
don’t
tell
your
friends
you’re
headed
down
to
the
jeweler’s
for
a
new
pet.
They
might
look
at
you
funny.

Summoners!
We’d
love
to
give
you
a
sneak-peak
at
some
of
Orianna,
the
Clockwork
Girl’s
gameplay
features.
We’re
blazing
new
mechanical
trails
with
this
champion,
and
we
want
to
share
the
excitement
with
you.
Orianna’s
key
gameplay
hook
is
commanding
her
primary
weapon
–
an
animated
hextech
ball
that
she
uses
as
a
focus
for
her
abilities.
This
ball
acts
as
a
focal
point
for
all
of
her
skills,
allowing
her
to
dynamically
control
space.
By
moving
The
Ball
(as
she
named
it)
and
then
activating
skills,
you
can
use
it
to
deal
magical
damage,
attach
it
to
allies
(then
use
them
as
the
focal
point
for
your
skills),
shield
friends,
or
even
move
enemies
out
of
position.
Knowing
how
and
when
to
use
Orianna’s
abilities
-
combined
with
strategic
setup
-
can
deny
entire
areas
of
a
combat
zone
or
support
a
key
ally
and
act
as
a
force
multiplier.
To
add
risk
to
the
kit,
her
passive
encourages
her
shorter-range
auto-attacks
to
maximize
her
damage
output.
This
means
you
can
play
safer
and
use
the
long
range
of
Orianna’s
ball,
but
to
lesser
effect
than
if
you
combine
it
with
auto-attacks.
We
made
this
decision
in
order
to
create
an
interesting
dichotomy
of
risk/reward
that
will
allow
expert
Orianna
players
to
stand
out.
We
want
to
push
the
boundaries
in
our
champion
creation
and
your
impressions
and
feedback
can
help
shape
this.
Let
us
know
what
you
think!
