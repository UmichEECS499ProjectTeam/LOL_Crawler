A
hotfix
is
a
change
made
to
the
game
that
includes
one
or
more
files
that
are
used
to
solve
certain
problems
in
the
game.
Generally,
hotfixes
are
made
to
solve
specific
issues
affecting
gameplay.
In
most
cases,
hotfixes
are
deployed
when
a
change
is
deemed
critical
enough
that
it
cannot
be
held
off
until
a
regular
content
patch
.
They
usually
only
require
a
server-side
change
with
no
download
involved
and
can
be
implemented
with
little
or
no
downtime.
Due
to
time
constraints,
hotfixes
cannot
be
tested
extensively,
and
as
such
are
riskier
than
regular
patches.
Tooltips,
graphics
or
other
content
stored
in
the
game
client
cannot
be
changed
with
a
server-side
hotfix,
and
instead
require
a
downloadable
fix.
As
mentioned
above,
hotfixes
are
generally
deployed
when
an
issue
is
important
enough
to
warrant
an
immediate
fix.
These
situations
include,
but
are
not
limited
to:
Urgent
balancing
(as
seen
with
LeBlanc
and
Lee
Sin
).
Fixing
bugs
that
greatly
hinder
gameplay.
Fixing
bugs
that
prevent
or
exploit
the
intended
use
of
the
game's
features.
Reverting
changes
made
unintentionally
in
a
patch.
List
of
Hotfixes
Below
is
a
table
mentioning
notable
changes
from
each
hotfix,
and
a
link
to
their
release
notes.
