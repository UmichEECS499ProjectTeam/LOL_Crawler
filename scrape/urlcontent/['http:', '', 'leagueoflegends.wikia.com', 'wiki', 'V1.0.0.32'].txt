PvP.Net
v0.29.03
General
Art
for
the
"End
of
Game"
has
been
updated.
The
summoner
profile
page
now
shows
more
detailed
stats
for
the
last
10
games
played.
Masteries
that
you
do
not
have
the
pre-requisites
for
are
now
grayed
out
for
easier
visual
reference.
The
champion
select
screens
have
been
improved
with
minor
visual
adjustments.
All
experience
bars
are
now
consistent
in
style
and
color.
"Champion
Skin
Browsing
Art"
has
been
improved.
Bugs
Fixed
a
bug
in
the
summoner
profile
that
showed
the
experience
bar
as
always
full.
Fixed
a
bug
that
was
causing
the
buddy
list
to
not
show
the
correct
status
during
or
after
games.
League
of
Legends
v1.0.0.32
New
in-game
HUD
Information
is
better
compartmentalized
with
your
abilities,
health,
mana,
and
experience
in
the
center;
player
information
and
stats
on
the
left;
and
the
mini-map
unchanged
on
the
right.
New
Team
Indicators
allow
you
to
quickly
compare
your
own
health
against
your
target's.
More
usable
gameplay
space,
with
less
HUD
interference
while
playing
on
the
purple
team.

higher
quality

scaling
means
that
UI
scale

New
Two-Lane
Map
–
Twisted
Treeline
Twisted
Treeline
is
one
of
the
few
remaining
forests
near
Zaun
that
has
not
been
exploited
for
natural
resources;
a
mere
cursory
glance
at
the
geography
of
the
arena
quickly
explains
why.
The
misuse
of
magic
–
mainly
from
Zaun
but
also
from
the
numerous
battles
fought
here
during
the
various
Rune
Wars
–
has
warped
the
verdant
environs
of
the
Twisted
Treeline
into
terrain
into
a
bizarre,
alien-like
visage.
Twisted
Treeline
can
be
accessed
in
the
Practice
Game
section.
