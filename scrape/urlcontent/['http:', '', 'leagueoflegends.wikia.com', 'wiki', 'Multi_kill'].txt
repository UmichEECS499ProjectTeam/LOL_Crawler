Multi
kill
A
kill
,
is
the
event
of
decreasing
an
enemy
champion's
health
to
zero
while
the
enemy
has
no
abilities
or
items
to
prevent
death
.
Death
may
be
prevented
by
certain
effects,
such
as
those
granted
by
the
item
Guardian
Angel
and
friendly
abilities
like
Zilean's
Chrono
Shift
,
or
delayed
by
passive
abilities
like
Anivia's
Rebirth
,
Zac's
Cell
Division
and
Aatrox's
Blood
Well
.

Rewards
The
last
player
to
strike
the
target
champion
is
awarded
with
the
kill,
and
all
contributors
within
the
last
10
seconds
are
awarded
with
an
assist
.
If
the
champion
killed
has
any
transferable
buffs
(
Crest
of
the
Ancient
Golem
or
Blessing
of
the
Lizard
Elder
),
the
killer
champion
gains
all
of
these
buffs
and
the
duration
of
each
buff
is
reset.
When
a
champion
is
killed,
the
player
who
scored
the
final
hit
receives
gold
(50-500g)
(on
Howling
Abyss
maximum
gold
for
a
kill
exceeds
500g)
and
experience
.
To
reduce
the
effectiveness
of
feeders
and
snowballing
lanes,
less
gold
is
awarded
when
a
champion
has
a
lower
level
than
the
killers.
Additionally,
a
champion
with
many
consecutive
deaths
will
award
a
significantly
reduced
bounty,
eventually
reaching
a
bounty
floor
of
50
gold,
nearly
the
gold
value
of
a
minion.
The
bounty
will
reset
to
300
if
said
champion
kills
an
enemy
champion,
or
resets
more
gradually
with
assists
or
farming
(refer
to
Bounty
values
Notes
below
for
details).
In
gameplay,
kills
may
be
sacrificed
in
favor
of
securing
a
map
objective,
or
due
to
other
situational
circumstances,
such
as
the
low
health
champion
retreating
into
high
risk
enemy
territory.
Execution
If
a
champion
dies
and
hasn't
been
damaged
or
debuffed
by
another
champion
in
the
last
13
seconds,
they
are
executed
.
Otherwise,
the
kill
is
awarded
to
the
enemy
champion
who
last
dealt
damage.
Executions
are
caused
by
a
turret
,
minion
,
or
monster
.
An
execution
offers
no
gold
but
still
grants
experience
to
nearby
champions
on
the
opposite
team
when
it
is
caused
by
a
turret
or
minion
.
In
some
cases
it
could
be
strategically
advantageous
for
a
player
to
purposefully
be
executed
as
an
alternative
to
dying
from
an
enemy
champion;
in
doing
so,
the
enemy
receives
no
gold.
Doing
this
on
ARAM
allows
you
to
visit
the
shop
without
granting
kills
to
the
enemy
team.
Note
that
executions
do
not
end
your
killing
spree.
Multi-kill
The
act
of
killing
several
champions
within
10
seconds
of
each
other
(30
seconds
to
Penta
Kill
after
a
Quadra
Kill
if
no
enemy
respawns).
The
following
comments
are
shown:
"Summoner"
has
slain
"(slain
name)
Summoner"
for
a
[...]!'
Double

(2)
Triple
Kill
(3)
Quadra

Legendary
Kill
(6+)
Ace
An
ace
is
defined
as
killing
the
last
living
champion
of
the
enemy
team.
Scoring
an
ace
is
far
easier
than
scoring
a
pentakill,
since
the
only
requisite
is
for
the
entire
allied
team
to
kill
the
enemy
team,
rather
than
one
person
killing
the
entire
enemy
team.
There
is
no
gold
bonus
associated
with
aces.
Gold
reward
The
standard
gain
per
kill
is
300
gold.
Every
kill
(in
a
row)
by
a
champion
increases
their
value
(the
reward
gained
for
killing
that
champion)
by
20%,
up
to
a
maximum
of
500
gold.
Each
death
(in
a
row)
of
a
champion
reduces
its
value,
by
8.5%
for
the
first
death
and
20%
for
every
death
afterwards,
to
a
minimum
of
50
gold.
The
bounty
will
reset
to
300
if
said
champion
kills
an
enemy
champion,
or
resets
more
gradually
with
assists.
Assists
remove
one
stage
of
the
death
penalty
each
(if
a
champion
was
on
his
third
death
(220
gold),
an
assist
would
raise
the
value
to
that
of
two
deaths
(275
gold)).
Every
kill
a
champion
achieves
without
dying
(called
a
killing
spree)
increases
that
champion's
bounty
to
a
maximum
of
500
gold
as
stated
before.
The
gold
bounty
is
not
reset
when
the
champion
is
executed
without
any
enemy
champion
contributing
to
it.
Being
on
a
killing
spree
only
affects
the
gold
gained
upon
your
death.
First
Blood
(the
first
kill
of
the
match)
gives
an
additional
100
gold
(400
total)
beyond
the
basic
amount
for
the
kill.
