General
The
Dominion
is
a
capture-and-hold,
fast-paced
game
mode
that
uses
Capture
Points
for
winning
the
game.
Two
summoner
spells,
Fortify
and
Teleport
,
weren't
suitable
for
Dominion,
and
thus,
they
were
replaced
by
two
new
summoner
spells:
Garrison
and
Promote
.
Reasons
for
replacement
Due
to
the
difference
in
gameplay
some
of
the
spells
will
have
no
use
anymore.
These
spells
will
be
replaced
by
different
spells
more
useful
to
the
different
style.
The
new
summoner
spell
Garrison
functions
by
strengthening
allied
shrines
and
weakening
opposing
ones.
And
for
a
game
where
movement
is
everything
the
summoner
spell
Teleport
would
give
too
much
of
an
advantage.
Instead
the
previously
removed
summoner
spell
Promote
will
take
its
place.
Masteries
The
masteries
for
Fortify
and
Teleport
will
change
into
those
for
Garrison
and
Promote
when
entering
a
game
of
Dominion.
This
is
a
change
for
the
previously
removed
spell
Promote
as
its
mastery
used
to
be
Demolisher
in
the
Offense
Mastery
tree.
What
the
name
for
the
new
utility
mastery
will
be,
is
of
yet
unknown.
