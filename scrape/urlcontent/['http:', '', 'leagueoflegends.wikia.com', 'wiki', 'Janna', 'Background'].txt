There
are
those
sorcerers
who
give
themselves
over
to
the
primal
powers
of
nature,
forgoing
the
learned
practice
of
magic.
Such
a
sorceress
is
Janna,
who
first
learned
magic
as
an
orphan
growing
up
amidst
the
chaos
that
is
the
city-state
of
Zaun
.
Janna
eked
out
what
living
she
could
on
the
streets.
Life
was
tough
and
dangerous
for
the
beautiful
young
girl,
and
she
survived
by
her
wits,
and
by
stealing
when
wits
weren't
enough.
The
rampant
magic
that
characterizes
Zaun
was
the
first
and
most
alluring
tool
which
Janna
realized
could
both
protect
and
elevate
her.
Janna
discovered
that
she
had
an
affinity
for
a
particular
type
of
magic
-
the
elemental
magic
of
air.
She
mastered
her
studies
of
air
magic
in
a
matter
of
months,
almost
as
if
she
was
born
of
it.
Janna
went
from
a
street
vagrant
to
an
avatar
of
the
air
virtually
overnight,
stunning
and
surpassing
those
who
taught
her.
Such
a
rapid
ascension
also
changed
her
physical
appearance,
giving
her
an
otherworldly
look.
Seeking
to
right
the
injustice
in
the
world
(particularly
the
insanity
that
has
become
the
city
of
Zaun),
Janna
has
brought
her
talents
to
the
League
.
She
is
a
voice
for
the
regulation
of
magical
experimentation
and
a
supporter
of
the
development
of
techmaturgy,
making
her
an
indirect
ally
of
the
city-state
of
Piltover
and
the
amazing
techmaturgical
minds
that
live
there.
Janna
is
also
a
new
favorite
of
the
League's
many
fans.
She
is
often
the
center
of
attention
at
functions,
fan
appreciation
days,
and
other
celebratory
events.
There
is
something
untouchable
about
Janna,
however,
and
her
affections
can
change
as
quickly
as
the
wind.
"Do
not
be
captivated
by
Janna's
beauty.
Like
the
wind,
she
is
one
gust
away
from
terrible
destruction."
