Vi,
the
Piltover
Enforcer

Friends
&

Champion
To
Vi,
every
problem
is
just
another
brick
wall
to
punch
through
with
her
gigantic
hextech
gauntlets.
Though
she
grew
up
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
law,
Vi
now
uses
her
criminal
know-how
to
serve
Piltover
's
police
force.
Vi's
brash
attitude,
abrasive
humor,
and
blatant
refusal
to
follow
orders
can
often
infuriate
her
by-the-books
partner,
Caitlyn
.
But
even
the
sheriff
of
Piltover
cannot
deny
that
Vi
is
an
invaluable
asset
in
the
fight
against
crime.
As
a
child
growing
up
in
the
lawless
outskirts
of
Piltover,
Vi
learned
to
rob
and
cheat
to
get
by.
Stealing
and
stripping
hextech
hardware
gave
her
the
skills
of
a
master
mechanic,
while
life
on
the
streets
taught
her
self-reliance.
When
she
was
six,
a
ragtag
group
of
criminals
took
a
shine
to
the
young
delinquent
and
brought
her
into
their
fold.
By
the
time
Vi
was
eleven,
she
had
become
a
seasoned
accomplice,
and
she
relished
the
thrill
of
every
heist.
Vi's
attitude
changed
when
a
raid
on
a
mining
facility
went
bad.
She
was
forced
to
decide
between
fleeing
with
her
crew
or
trying
to
save
the
innocent
mine
workers
from
a
collapsed
tunnel.
Vi
chose
to
play
the
hero.
While
searching
for
a
way
to
free
the
mine
workers
from
the
rubble,
she
discovered
a
damaged
robotic
mining
rig.
Improvising,
she
wrenched
off
its
huge
fists
and
modified
them
into
makeshift
hextech
gauntlets.
Fitting
the
heavy
weapons
to
her
tiny
hands,
the
young
girl
flexed
her
arm
and
threw
a
powered
punch
at
the
rubble.
The
force
of
the
blow
blasted
away
the
rock.
With
the
workers
free
to
escape,
Vi
fled
the
scene.
After
that
job
gone
wrong,
Vi
severed
her
connection
to
the
crew.
She
returned
to
a
life
of
solitary
crime,
but
stole
only
from
other
criminals.
As
the
years
went
by,
Vi
modified
and
improved
her
hextech
fists,
allowing
her
to
bust
up
heists
and
snatch
loot
with
ease.
Eventually,
word
of
her
notoriety
reached
Caitlyn,
the
famed
Sheriff
of
Piltover.
Rather
than
seek
Vi's
arrest,
Caitlyn
offered
the
criminal
a
way
to
pay
her
debt
to
society:
work
for
the
law
in
Piltover.
Vi
laughed.
To
her,
a
job
that
let
her
beat
up
crooks
without
forcing
her
to
run
from
the
cops
sounded
perfect.
She
immediately
accepted.
Caitlyn
now
struggles
to
keep
Vi
in
line,
and
Vi
treats
Caitlyn's
orders
as
mere
suggestions,
but
when
they
work
together,
they
are
feared
by
all
lawbreakers
in
Piltover.
"It's
a
shame.
I've
got
two
fists,
but
you've
only
got
one
face."

Greetings
PBE
Summoners,
I
am
happy
to
announce
that
our
final
champion
of
the
year
is
now
(or
soon
will
be)
available
for
testing
on
the
PBE.
Allow
me
to
introduce
Vi,
the
Piltover
Enforcer.
Imagine
two
giant
hextech
gauntlets.
Now
imagine
a
total
badass
who
loves
using
those
gauntlets
to
hit
things.
Hard.
That's
Vi
in
a
nutshell.
Have
you
ever
wished
you
could
punch
an
enemy
with
such
an
impact
that
you
hit
the
enemies
behind
it?
If
your
answer
is
yes,
you
may
enjoy
playing
Vi.
Have
you
ever
had
the
desire
to
wind
up
a
punch
powerful
enough
to
carry
you
across
the
battlefield,
clocking
anyone
unlucky
enough
to
get
in
your
way?
If
your
answer
is
yes,
you
may
enjoy
playing
Vi.
Have
you
ever
wanted
to
indiscriminately
bowl
through
an
enemy
team,
wiping
the
smirk
off
that
AD
carry's
face
as
you
slam
it
into
the
ground?
If
your
answer
is
yes,
well,
you
get
the
idea.
Vi
is
all
about
powerful
punches.
She's
a
high
mobility
high
damage
bruiser
who
picks
a
target,
launches
herself
into
the
fray,
and
makes
that
target
deal
with
her.
So
what
are
you
waiting
for?
Go
try
her
out.
I'd
love
to
hear
your
feedback.
Best
of
luck
on
the
Fields
of
Justice!
Vi,
the
Piltover
Enforcer,
Revealed
Announcement
made
by
NeeksNaman:
[2]
There's
nothing
more
satisfying
than
the
sounds
of
your
enemies
succumbing
to
an
extreme
beat-down.
Not
to
Vi,
anyway,
the
newest
champion
to
join
the
League.
Punching,
excessive
force,
and
armor-busting
brutality
are
what
she’s
all
about.
At
home
in
top
lane
or
the
jungle,
Vi's
playstyle
revolves
around
pummeling
opponents
and
tearing
into
and
shattering
their
armor.
Vi's
signature
punch
is
Vault
Breaker.
When
you
first
activate
the
ability,
Vault
Breaker
begins
charging
a
powerful
punch.
Activating
Vault
Breaker
a
second
time
causes
you
to
dash
forward,
dealing
damage
to
units
and
knocking
back
enemy
champions.
Early
game,
Vi
excels
at
bullying
opponents
while
shoving
the
lane
with
Vault
Breaker
and
the
AoE
damage
from
Excessive
Force.
Skillful
use
of
Excessive
Force
allows
you
to
quickly
clear
your
lane
while
harassing
opponents
trying
to
get
in
close
to
last
hit
minions.
When
team
fights
erupt,
Vi's
ultimate
allows
you
to
charge
through
your
opponents'
front-line
and
crush
their
carries.
Assault
and
Battery
locks
on
to
an
enemy
champion.
You
then
chase
them
down,
uppercutting
them
into
the
air.
Enemies
unfortunate
enough
to
be
in
the
way
are
knocked
aside.
High
damage,
armor
debuffs,
and
knockbacks
make
you
a
disruptive
force.
Since
Vi's
attacks
and
activated
abilities
apply
stacks
of
Denting
Blows,
you
can
increase
your
damage
significantly
against
armored
opponents
by
just
doing
what
you
do
best:
punching.
To
top
it
all
off,
Vi's
Blast
Shield
helps
her
survive
not
only
big
damage
bursts,
but
also
prolonged
team
fights.
Are
you
ready
to
slip
on
your
gauntlets
and
show
off
your
pummeling
prowess?
Once
your
opponents
get
a
glimpse
of
your
heavy
weaponry,
it's
punch
or
be
punched.
