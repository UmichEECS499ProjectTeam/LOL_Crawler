Trivia
Ezreal
is
voiced
by
Kyle
Hebert
,
Who
also
voices
Graves
and
Jarvan
IV
.
Pulsefire
Ezreal's
AI,
PEARL,
is
voiced
by
Christine
Brynn
Khalil
.
Ezreal
was
both
named
after
and
designed
by
Colt
'Ezreal'
Hallam
,
one
of
Riot
's
game
designers.
Ezreal
was
one
of
the
champions
chosen
for
the
Ionian
pool
available
during
the
Ionia
vs.
Noxus
match
.
However,
he
was
not
one
of
the
selected
champions.
Ezreal
is
the
first
champion
to
have
a
Champion
Spotlight
on
Riot's
YouTube
channel.
Though
it
is
unlisted,
it
can
be
viewed
here
Ezreal's
/dance
is
a
direct
homage
to
Hare
Hare
Yukai
dance
from
the
anime
The
Melancholy
of
Haruhi
Suzumiya
.
Hallam
states
this
"was
all
Shurelia's
idea".
[1]
A
side-by-side
comparison
can
be
seen
here
.
Ezreal
was
the
first
6300
IP
Champion
released
after
the
official
launch
of
the
game
in
October
2009.
Ezreal
found
the
Wriggle's
Lantern
on
one
of
his
archeological
expeditions
to
Kumungu.
[2]
Ezreal
is
the
third
champion
to
feature
2
champion
spotlights
due
to
significant
changes
to
his
kit.
The
others
being
Lee
Sin
,
Karma
and
Sivir
.
Quotes
Ezreal's
quotes
"You
belong
in
a
museum!"
and
"Noxians...
I
hate
those
guys..."
are
both
references
to
similar
lines
from
the
Indiana
Jones
franchise.
Ezreal's
quote
"It's
all
skill"
is
most
likely
a
reference
to
three
of
his
abilities
being
skillshots
.
When
Ezreal
does
his
/taunt,
he
motions
flipping
a
coin
and
shooting
at
it.
This
action
requires
great
accuracy
and
is
often
seen
in
Western
films.
On
the
test
realm,
Ezreal's
/joke
was
"My
age
exceeds
your
IQ...
significantly."
and
the
taunt
-
"Just
the
thought
of
killing
you
is
likely
to
cause
it."
These
were
changed
on
live
release.
Pulsefire
Ezreal's
taunt
is
a
reference
to
the
"Over
9000"
meme
derived
from
an
episode
of
the
anime
Dragon
Ball
Z
.
A
side-by-side
comparison
can
be
seen
here.
.
Coincidentally,
Ezreal's
voice
actor,
Kyle
Hebert,
also
voiced
Gohan
and
a
number
of
others
in
Dragon
Ball
Z
.
Pulsefire
Ezreal's
quote
"Grim
dark
future,
eh"
is
a
reference
to
Warhammer
40K
universe's
tagline
"In
the
grim
darkness
of
a
far
future,
there
is
only
war"
.
[3]
Pulsefire
Ezreal's
quote
upon
recall
"Leaving
the
grid"
is
a
reference
to
the
Tron
franchise.
Skins
Nottingham
Ezreal
is
a
reference
to
Robin
Hood
,
an
archer
of
legendary
skill,
famous
in
English
folklore.
The
Striker
Ezreal
skin,
along
with
the
soccer
skins
for
other
champions,
appeared
just
before
the
2010
World
Cup
started,
and
were
removed
from
the
store
on
October
31
st
,
2010.
Frosted
Ezreal
was
based
on
a
creation
of
Clockmort
named
"Nightwalker
Ezreal"
.
Explorer
Ezreal
could
be
a
reference
to
the
web
browser
Internet
Explorer
.
He
seems
to
be
part
of
a
set
of
skins
that
have
a
browser
reference,
including
Chrome
Rammus
,
Safari
Caitlyn
,
and
Foxfire
Ahri
.
Pulsefire
Ezreal
:
The
skin
is
called
"Méga
Ezreal"
in
the
French
version.
It
is
a
reference
to
the
main
character
from
the
Megaman/Rockman
games.
This
skin's
release
was
delayed
because,
according
to
Riot,
it
"wasn't
quite
what
they
wanted".
Even
before
this
decision,
the
skin
was
used
in
the
MLG.
The
skin
is
still
in
the
game
files
under
the
name
"CyberEzreal"
in
SIU.
[4]
[5]
[6]
Its
taunt,
asking
about
power
levels,
is
a
reference
to
Dragon
Ball
Z
.
It
is
the
first
skin
to
include
two
personalities
in
its
voice-overs:
Ezreal
and
his
suit's
AI,
PEARL.
[7]
It
is
the
first
skin
to
change
its
appearance
depending
on
the
champion's
level.
Ezreal's
armor
upgrades
when
he
ranked
Trueshot
Barrage
(minimum
levels
6,
11,
and
16).
[8]
It
is
the
first
skin
priced
at
3250.
It
was
discounted
by
50%
for
the
first
four
days
after
release
to
a
price
of
1625
.
[9]
Due
to
the
long
production
time
and
anticipated
release
of
the
skin,
Riot
has
posted
a
short
Developer
Diary
on
the
forums,
chronicling
some
of
Pulsefire
Ezreal's
development.
His
recall
animation
resembles
the
pose
seen
theatrical
release
poster
of
the
1982
film
Tron
.
The
Preview
videos
released
as
the
skin's
teaser
are
unlisted
but
can
be
seen
here.

Taipei
Assassins
",

have
won
the

shares
a
similar
hairstyle
(including
hair
color
and
headset)

Relationships
The
stolen
image
It
is
possible
that
the
glass
of
Demacia
mentioned
in
Ezreal's
diary
was
stolen
by
Lux
.
Lyte
,
the
hermit,
is
also
Ezreal's
uncle.
[10]
A
Zaun
Lab
Bot
had
apparently
stolen
an
image
of
these
two
and
has
made
it
public.
[11]
On
the
new
website,
Ezreal
and
Lux
are
listed
as
friends,
while
this
could
be
only
because
their
aren't
any
more
specific
classifications
for
related
champs.
[12]
In
An
Ancient
Mystery
In
Runeterra
it
was
revealed
that
Ezreal
and
Twisted
Fate
occasionaly
play
cards,
though
Ezreal
rarely
wins.
Ezreal
doesn't
like
Noxians.

I
do
not
like
Pulsfire
Ezreal
that
much
actaully.
I
am
a
fan
of
Explorer
Ezreal.
So
for
me,
Spirit
Guard
Udyr
is
the
better
skin.

I've
never
played
Nottingham
Ezreal,
how
can
I
get
that
skin?
Anyway
-
np!
Ezreal's
quite
feminine
and
it's
awesome.
He's
so
cute.

TheTobarMethod
.....kinda....kinda
not?
Im
not
really
sure.
In
his
lore,
it
points
to
him
being
younger
so
what
im
guessing,
is
that
he
is
most
likely
around
...
