Armour
Armor
is
a
stat
shared
by
all
units,
including
minions
,
monsters
,
and
buildings.
Increasing
armor
reduces
the
physical
damage
the
unit
takes.
Each
champion
begins
with
some
armor
which
increases
with
level
(
Thresh
being
the
only
exception).
You
can
gain
additional
armor
from
abilities
,
items
,
masteries
,
and
runes
.
Armor
stacks
additively
.
Excluding
Thresh
whose
base
armor
does
not
scale
with
levels,
base
armor
ranges
from
62
(
Orianna
)
to
90
(
Maokai
and
Poppy
)
at
level
18.

Damage
reduction
Incoming
physical
damage
is
multiplied
by
a
factor
based
on
the
unit's
armor:
$${\rm
Damage\
multiplier}=\begin{cases}
{100
\over
100+{\it
Armor}},
&
{\rm
if\
}{\it
Armor}
\geq
0\\
2
-
{100
\over
100
-
{\it
Armor}},
&
{\rm
otherwise}
\end{cases}$$
Examples:
25
armor
→
×0.
8
incoming
physical
damage
(20%
reduction,
+25%
effective
health).
100
armor
→
×0.
5
incoming
physical
damage
(50%
reduction,
+100%
effective
health).
−25
armor
→
×1.
20
incoming
physical
damage
(20%
increase,
−16.
67
%
effective
health).
Stacking
armor
Every
point
of
armor
requires
a
unit
to
take
1%
more
of
its
maximum
health
in
physical
damage
to
be
killed.
This
is
called
effective
health.
Example:
A
unit
with
60
armor
has
60%
more
of
its
maximum
health
in
effective
health,
so
if
the
unit
has
1000
maximum
health,
it
will
take
1600
physical
damage
to
kill
it.
What
this
means:
by
definition,
armor
does
not
have
diminishing
returns,
because
each
point
increases
the
unit's
effective
health
against
physical
damage
by
1%
of
its
current
actual
health
whether
the
unit
has
10
armor
or
1000
armor.
Note:
Unlike
health,
increasing
armor
also
makes
healing
more
effective
because
it
takes
more
effort
to
remove
the
unit's
health
than
it
does
to
restore
it.
For
a
more
detailed
explanation,
see
this
video
.
When
a
unit's
armor
is
negative
because
of
armor
reduction
or
debuffs,
armor
has
increasing
returns,
because
negative
armor
cannot
reduce
effective
health
to
less
than
50%
of
actual
health.
A
unit
with
−100
has
66.
67
%
(gains
−33.
33
%)
of
its
maximum
health
as
effective
health.
Armor
as
Scaling
These
use
the
champion's
armor
to
increase
the
magnitude
of
the
ability.
It
could
involve
total
or
bonus
armor.
By
building
armor
items,
you
can
receive
more
benefit
and
power
from
these
abilities.
