Lore
Ravaged
by
Rune
Wars
long
past,
the
lands
south
of
the
Great
Barrier
are
wrecked
by
chaotic
magical
storms,
leaving
the
grasp
of
nature's
rule
tenuous
at
best.
While
abnormal
flora
or
fauna
are
the
norm
rather
than
the
exception
in
these
ruined
areas,
none
are
more
curious
than
the
living
organisms
found
in
the
Plague
Jungles.
There,
uneven
concentrations
of
magic
and
life
would
well
up
until
they
burst,
resulting
in
evolution
at
an
unprecedented
rate.
Rammus,
the
Armordillo
The
Armordillo
While
no
one
is
entirely
certain
why
an
armadillo
from
the
Shurima
Desert
crossed
the
Kumungu
Jungle
into
the
Plague
Jungles,
Rammus
made
just
such
a
journey.
There,
amongst
the
twisted
vines
and
festering
rot,
he
came
across
an
oddity
-
a
healthy
evergreen
hedge
maze,
stretching
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see.
As
he
explored
the
maze,
something
compelled
him
towards
its
center
-
a
light,
a
presence
of
some
kind.
As
he
drew
closer,
the
light
surged,
blinding
him
and
knocking
him
unconscious.
When
he
awoke,
Rammus'
whole
world
had
changed.
The
maze
had
vanished
and
he
felt
truly
cognizant
for
the
first
time
in
his
otherwise
unremarkable
life.
As
his
predicament
dawned
on
him,
Rammus
had
a
moment
of
panic.
As
he
trembled,
the
earth
around
him
began
to
shake,
the
intensity
increasing
until
he
managed
to
steady
himself.
As
the
quake
receded,
Rammus
arose
and
left
the
Plague
Jungles
in
search
of
others
like
him.
The
Monkey
King
Wukong,
the
Monkey
King
During
the
chaos
of
the
Rune
Wars,
an
enormous
runestone
was
lost
deep
within
the
Plague
Jungles.
It
remained
there,
untouched
for
centuries,
emanating
a
potent
magic
which
infused
nearby
wildlife
with
sentience
and
vitality.
A
group
of
monkeys
who
were
particularly
empowered
by
it
came
to
worship
the
stone,
and
their
leader
-
a
wise
sage
-
became
convinced
that
he
could
harness
its
power
to
make
the
monkeys
immortal.
He
performed
an
elaborate
ritual,
but
things
didn't
go
as
he
expected.
The
runestone
was
destroyed,
and
instead
of
granting
immortality,
it
produced
Kong
,
a
monkey
who
carried
in
his
heart
the
strength
and
power
it
had
contained.
Kong
was
driven
by
an
unquenchable
desire
for
greatness.
He
sought
out
every
beast
and
monster
the
Plague
Jungles
could
offer,
eager
to
find
a
worthy
opponent,
but
none
offered
the
challenge
he
craved.
He
asked
the
sage
for
advice,
and
learned
about
a
legend
of
hairless
monkeys
to
the
north
who,
with
wits
and
might,
had
bent
the
world
to
their
will.
Kong
left,
journeying
north,
determined
to
discover
if
the
legend
was
true.
