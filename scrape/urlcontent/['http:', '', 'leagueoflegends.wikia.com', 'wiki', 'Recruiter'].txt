it
does
not

someone
that
you
have
referred
reaches
summoner
level
5,
the
player
that
invited
him
is

will
let
you
a
4-win
IP
boost
that
you
can
redeem
whenever
you
want.
In
addition,
every

Riot
Games
and
develop
a
champion
with
the
Riot
Design
Team
(the
expenses

Tim
Buckley
lost
his
chance
to
design
a
champion
after
suggesting
an
eccentric
Spider-Shark
champion
based
on
the
Japanese
horror
manga,
Gyo
.
Because
the
theme
didn't
fit
with
the
lore,
he
only
visited
Riot
Games
HQ.
Version

Players
earn

time
a
referral
reaches
level

and

rewards
are
one
time
only
prizes
unless
otherwise
noted,
