The
Iceborn
are
a
nearly
extinct
humanoid
race
that
inhabit
Freljord
,
the
last
survivor
being
Lissandra
.
History
The
Iceborn
were
a
powerful
group
of
people
who
lived
in
the
Freljord
centuries
ago.
As
explained
by
Lissandra
,
ancient
people
who
lived
in
Freljord
were
visited
by
mysterious
entities
known
as
the
Frozen
Watchers.
The
Watchers
were
beings
of
great
power
and
knowledge.
They
made
these
people
immortal
and
gave
them
powerful
magic
in
exchange
for
their
servitude,
dubbing
them
Iceborn
.
Lissandra
was
known
as
"The
Seeker"
,
who
served
as
the
mediator
between
the
two
factions,
passing
orders
from
the
Watchers
to
the
Iceborn.
After
some
time,
two
Iceborn
leaders,
Lissandra's
sisters:
Avarosa
(
Ashe's
ancestor)
and
Serylda,
(
Sejuani's
ancestor)
formed
a
rebellion
against
the
Watchers,
wanting
to
break
away
from
their
rule
and
be
free.
Lissandra
,
however
remained
loyal
to
the
Watchers
and
is
still
serving
them
to
this
day.
On
a
fateful
day,
Avarosa's
Iceborn
horde
had
their
final
battle
against
the
Watchers
on
what
is
now
known
as
the
Howling
Abyss.
In
the
end,
the
Watchers
were
defeated
and
thrown
into
the
abyss,
supposedly
killing
them,
however,
according
to
Lissandra
and
suggested
by
Greyor
and
Lyte
they
are
very
much
alive,
and
making
their
way
back
onto
the
surface.
After
the
defeat
of
the
Watchers
the
Iceborn
had
a
legendary
War,
known
as
"The
War
of
The
Three
Sisters"
where
Avarosa,
Serylda
and
Lissandra
battled
for
control
over
the
Freljord.
The
war
eventually
ended
with
no
victor
and
Avarosa
assassinated
by
Lissandra,
but
the
tribes
continued
to
have
skirmishes
over
the
ages.
The
Iceborn
later
on
likely
became
extinct;
the
majority
killed
in
the
rebellion
against
the
Watchers
and
the
War
of
The
Three
Sisters
,
and
with
no
Watchers
to
up
rise
people
into
Iceborn
the
race
dwindled
quickly,
leaving
their
place
to
normal
human
descendants.
To
this
day,
there
is
only
one
known
living
Iceborn,
The
Ice
Witch,
Lissandra,
who
has
carefully
hidden
her
identity
by
killing
and
taking
the
place
of
her
own
successors.
Greyor,
the
shopkeer
in
the
Howling
Abyss
is
a
deceased
Iceborn
(as
stated
by
himself).
He
was
killed
by
Avarosa
so
that
his
spirit
will
serve
as
the
eternal
guardian
of
the
Howling
Abyss
and
adviser
should
the
Watchers
return.
Powers
and
Abilities
Iceborn
do
not
die
of
old
age
nor
do
they
physically
age.
This
can
be
clearly
seen
in
Lissandra
.
Despite
this,
Iceborn
do
not
heal
from
injuries
that
a
normal
person
wouldn't
heal
from.
Lissandra
lost
her
sight
to
an
Ursine
several
centuries
ago
and
is
still
blind
today.
Iceborns
can
control
and
manipulate
ice.
This
can
be
observed
in
Lissandra
.
No
other
humans
have
been
observed
to
manipulate
ice.
While
Ashe
and
Sejuani
are
shown
to
control
ice
it
is
more
likely
that
they
draw
this
power
from
their
True
Ice
weapons
rather
than
from
their
Iceborn-heritage.
On
any
case,
other
creatures
such
as
Yetis
and
elementals
(like
Anivia
)
are
known
to
control
and
manipulate
ice.
Iceborns
can
change
their
appearance
at
will.
This
is
evidenced
in
Lissandra's
ability
to
take
other
persons
identities
and
Greyor's
abnormally
huge
and
disproportionate
body.
Lissandra
has
the
ability
to
sense
her
surroundings
to
perfection.
It
has
been
speculated
that
she
uses
temperature
or
ice
near
her
to
do
this.
She
developed
this
technique
to
be
functional
as
she
is
blind
,
but
it
is
not
known
if
the
ancient
Iceborn
had
this
ability.
The
Iceborn
are
the
first
known
users
of
True
Ice,
and
likely
their
discoverers
or
creators.
