Notes
Sheen
(as
well
as
Trinity
Force
and
Iceborn
Gauntlet
)
only
multiplies
the
champions
starting
base
attack
damage
plus
any
gained
from
leveling
up.
Bonus
attack
damage
from
items,
runes
,
and
masteries
is
not
included,
nor
does
it
include
the
bonus
damage
from
skills
like
Ezreal's
Mystic
Shot
,
Gangplank's
Parrrley
,
Irelia's
Bladesurge
,
or
Shaco's
Deceive
.
If
the
attack
is
a
critical
hit,
the
bonus
damage
from
Sheen
is
not
boosted.
Sheen
bonus
damage
procs
off
Lifesteal.
It
does
not
proc
off
Spell
Vamp,
however.
The
proc
has
a
cooldown
of
2
seconds,
and
the
10
second
bonus
damage
buff
does
not
stack.
Using
two
skills
in
quick
succession
will
not
accrue
two
stacks
of
bonus
damage,
but
one.
The
bonus
damage
does
not
stack
with
Trinity
Force
,
Lich
Bane
or
Iceborn
Gauntlet
,
since
they
all
have
a
unique
passive
with
the
same
name.
Trivia
The
proc
effect
of
Sheen
causes
the
champion's
weapon
or
hands
glow
red,
the
same
graphic
as
Nunu's
Blood
Boil
.
Passive
toggle
abilities
such
as
Blood
Scent
or
Frost
Shot
do
not
proc
Sheen's
effect
but
active
toggle
abilities
such
as
Ravenous
Flock
do.
