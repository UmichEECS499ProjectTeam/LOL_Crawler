Loss
forgiven
(also
known
as
Loss
Prevented
)
is
an
element
of
League
of
Legends
that
forgives
a
loss
when
it
happens
during
times
of
server
instability,
due
to
being
outside
of
a
player's
control
[1]
.
Severe
bugs
within
the
client
that
prompt
in-client
warnings
and
queue-disabling
can
also
lead
to
Loss
Forgiven.
The
conditions
of
a
loss
forgiven
are
as
follows:
Users
will
not
receive
a
Loss
or
Leave
from
being
in
game
or
champion
select.
Users
will
not
lose
League
Points
.
Users
will
not
get
a
lose
when
they
are
in
promo
series.
All
users
will
receive
all
of
the
XP
and
IP
that
they
are
entitled
to
upon
game
completion.
Stats
will
be
recorded
and
saved
for
games,
but
they
will
not
count
towards
any
lifetime
aggregates,
and
will
be
labeled
as
such.
Players
will
not
receive
loss
forgiven
for
personal
connection
problems,
such
as
issues
with
your
router
or
ISP,
nor
will
losses
be
forgiven
for
freak
incidents
with
the
client
(such
as
bug
splats).
