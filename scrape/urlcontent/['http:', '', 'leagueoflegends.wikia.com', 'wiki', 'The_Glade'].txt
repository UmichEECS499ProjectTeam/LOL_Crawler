Lulu
and
Pix
near
the
entrance
to
the
Glade
The
Glade
is
a
hidden
area
in
Valoran
located
near
Bandle
City
.
Lore
The
Glade,
the
enchanted
home
of
the
fae,
lay
nestled
in
a
clearing
in
the
woods
neighbouring
Bandle
City.
There
the
rigid
properties
of
the
outside
world
-
things
like
size
and
color
-
changed
as
frequently
and
whimsically
as
the
direction
of
the
wind.
The
Story
of
the
Yordle
Child
Pix
,
a
fae
spirit,
came
to
the
forests
of
the
Yordle
Lands.
There
he
met
the
yordle
child
Lulu
which
he
lured
into
the
Glade
by
pretending
to
be
stuck
in
a
birdhouse.
Once
Lulu
was
close
enough,
he
brought
her
into
the
Glade.
Lulu's
life
in
the
Glade
was
comfortable,
natural,
and
carefree.
She
and
Pix
played
fae
games
together,
the
sorts
of
games
that
she
had
been
told
were
“only
pretend,”
and
she
got
exceedingly
good
at
them.
It
caught
her
by
surprise
when
she
suddenly
remembered
that
she
had
left
a
life
behind
in
Bandle
City.
The
Glade
had
a
way
of
making
everything
outside
seem
distant
and
surreal.
Lulu
decided
to
revisit
her
former
home.
Along
with
Pix,
she
returned
to
the
Yordle
Lands
and
has
yet
to
return
to
the
Glade.
