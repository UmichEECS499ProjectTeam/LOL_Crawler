Trivia
Rengar
was
designed
by
Classick
.
[1]
Rengar
is
voiced
by
Patrick
Seitz
,
who
also
voiced
Kog'Maw
,
Renekton
and
Lucian
.
Rengar's
lore
and
personality
are
most
likely
inspired
by
the
short
story
The
Most
Dangerous
Game
by
Richard
Connell
.
Rengar's
concept
might
be
inspired
by
the
Charr
,
a
race
from
the
Guild
Wars
franchise.
Rengar
also
shares
many
resemblances
to
the
one-eyed
leonin
warrior
Planeswalker
,
Ajani
Goldmane
,
from
the
Magic:
The
Gathering
trading
card
game.
Rengar's
hairstyle,
wrist
blades,
passive,
and
ultimate
are
references
to
the
Predator
franchise.
Rengar's
appearance
is
also
similar
to
one
of
the
alien
bounty
hunters
in
Samurai
Jack
.
Rengar
is
the
first
champion
to
have
two
unique
items
:
Bonetooth
Necklace
and
Head
of
Kha'Zix
.
He
is
the
second
champion
to
have
at
least
one
unique
item,
the
first
being
Viktor
.
Rengar's
dance
is
a
reference
to
the
New
Zealand
tribal
dance,
Maori
haka
,
particularly
the
Ka
Mate
.
A
side-by-side
comparison
can
be
seen
here
.
Rengar
is
one
of
ten
champions
to
reference
another
champion
in-game,
the
others
being
Zed
,
Renekton
,
Volibear
,
Graves
,
Kha'Zix
,
Aatrox
,
Quinn
,
Vi
,
and
Jinx
.
Rengar's
passive,
Unseen
Predator
,
is
similar
to
Nidalee's
passive,
Prowl
,
in
that
they
both
provide
utility
while
in
the
brush.
Caitlyn's
Headshot
is
also
an
ability
that
uses
the
brush
specifically
in
activation.
Initially,
many
in
the
community
believed
that
Rengar
had
fought
Cho'Gath
in
his
lore.
It
was
later
revealed
that
it
was
Kha'Zix
that
Rengar
was
fighting.
Rengar's
overall
concept
shares
very
similar
concepts
to
the
lyrics
of
the
song
Eye
of
the
Tiger
by
Survivor
.
Rengar,
the
"Tiger",
lost
one
eye,
leaving
him
with
only
one,
the
"eye
of
the
tiger".
Rengar's
ultimate
Thrill
of
the
Hunt
could
be
a
reference
to
"the
thrill
of
the
fight".
Rengar
is
trying
to
hunt
and
kill
his
rival
Kha'Zix
.
Rengar
is
an
anagram
for
ranger.
In
every
one
of
Rengar's
quote,
he
'purrs'
a
bit,
but
the
sound
projected
is
a
bit
like
gurgling.
It
is
highly
possible
that
Rengar
drools
out
a
lot.
Rengar's
artificial
orange
eye
resembles
that
of
Bear
Cavalry
Sejuani
's
bear,
who
also
has
a
left
eye
missing
on
the
same
side
as
Rengar's
artificial
eye
-
this
suggests
that
Rengar
may
have
taken
the
bear's
eye
after
Kha'zix
removed
his
own
during
their
conflict.
Skins
Headhunter
Rengar
skin
is
most
likely
a
reference
to
the
Predator
species
from
the
Predator
franchise,
sporting
similar
wrist
blades,
armor,
fishnets
and
hair.
Additionaly,
when
Rengar
uses
his
ultimate
while
using
the
Headhunter
skin,
a
woodpecker-esque
sound
can
be
heard.
This
sound
is
the
same
sound
that
the
Predator
makes
while
stalking
his
prey.
In
the
Headhunter
skin's
splash
art,
you
can
see
Dragon's
and
Baron
Nashor's
skulls
on
the
left
side.This
shoulder
pad
seems
to
be
Vilemaw's
skull.
In
the
Headhunter
skin's
splash
art,
Rengar
is
seen
wearing
his
unique
item,
Bonetooth
Necklace
.
Relations
Rengar
fought
against
Kha'Zix
and
lost
his
left
eye
during
the
conflict.
He
seeks
to
one
day
slay
Kha'Zix
and
add
the
monster's
head
to
his
collection
as
his
most
prized
trophy.
The
conflict
between
Rengar
and
Kha'Zix
is
a
reference
to
the
Alien
vs.
Predator
series.
The
Hunt
Is
On
As
part
of
the
event
The
Hunt
Is
On!
,
Rengar
and
Kha'Zix
are
assigned
to
defeat
one
another
in
battle.
The
first
to
score
a
kill
on
the
other
claims
victory
(assists
count).
The
event
begins
randomly
after
Kha'Zix
has
used
all
3
evolution
points,
Rengar
is
in
possession
of
the
Bonetooth
Necklace
with
at
least
10
stacks,
and
all
members
of
both
teams
must
be
alive
for
the
event
to
start.
If
Kha'Zix
is
victorious,
he
gains
a
fourth
evolution
point.
If
Rengar
is
victorious,
his
Bonetooth
Necklace
is
replaced
with
the
Head
of
Kha'Zix
,
which
grants
him
the
bonuses
of
a
fully
stacked
Bonetooth
Necklace
.
This
event
can
only
occur
once
per
game,
even
if
both
teams
possess
both
champions.
A
video
describing
the
event
can
be
found
here
