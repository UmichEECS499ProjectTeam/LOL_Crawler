Lore
The
human
city-state
of
Noxus
is
in
many
ways
the
moral
antithesis
of
Demacia
;
it
is
a
settlement
where
the
physically
and
mentally
strong
acquire
power
through
any
means,
regardless
of
the
consequences
to
their
fellow
citizens.
Culture
The
citizenry
of
Noxus
generally
stands
behind
the
principle
that
"only
the
strong
survive",
regarding
the
qualities
of
benevolence
and
compassion
as
signs
of
weakness.
Strength
begets
strength,
at
least
as
far
as
the
humans
of
Noxus
are
concerned.
This
seeming
cruelty,
however,
is
not
an
indicator
of
chaos.
As
is
naturally
and
necessarily
the
case
with
humankind,
Noxus
is
an
orderly
city-state,
where
rules
protect
the
citizenry
from
harm…
at
least
from
their
peers.
In
Noxus,
however,
those
with
power
are
clearly
protected
by
the
law
more
than
those
without
it.
Where
other
human
settlements
tend
to
welcome
non-humans
into
their
midst,
Noxians
are
decidedly
xenophobic.
Non-humans
are,
at
best,
made
to
feel
unwelcome
within
the
borders
of
this
city-state.
There
are
exceptions
to
this,
but
only
after
the
non-humans
in
question
have
proven
themselves
to
be
either
useful
or
feared
(or
both).
Human
visitors
and
immigrants
to
Noxus
are
made
to
feel
only
slightly
better,
again
proving
themselves
only
by
either
demonstrating
competence
or
inspiring
terror
in
their
enemies.
Prior
to
the
formation
of
the
League
,
Noxus
was
renowned
for
a
spectacle
called
The
Fleshing.
It
was
a
gladiatorial
event
with
a
cruel
twist:
as
a
fighter
wins
their
matches,
the
number
of
opponents
they
fight
simultaneously,
generally
other
prisoners
of
war,
would
increase.
This
meant
eventual
death
for
every
contender,
though
also
unparalleled
glory.
Both
Xin
Zhao,
the
Seneschal
of
Demacia
,
and
Alistar,
the
Minotaur
,
are
survivors
of
the
spectacle,
with
Xin
Zhao
holding
the
record
for
defeating
the
most
opponents,
though
it
is
rumoured
that
Xin's
survival
of
his
encounter
with
'The
Fleshing'
is
linked
to
a
hidden
relationship
between
him
and
a
member
of
the
Du
Couteau
family.
Noxian
crest
Government
The
ruling
political
organization
of
Noxus
is
called
the
Noxian
High
Command,
and
it
acts
as
the
head
of
the
military.
In
Noxus,
the
military
controls
every
aspect
of
the
political
landscape;
there
is
no
separation
between
the
warfare
and
politics.
The
eternally
youthful-looking
leader
of
the
High
Command,
General
Boram
Darkwill,
had
ruled
Noxus
for
countless
years.
General
Darkwill
had
far
exceeded
his
average
lifespan
as
a
human;
it
is
rumored
that
he
was
kept
alive
through
necromantic
magic.
Such
a
conclusion
would
seem
to
make
sense,
especially
when
considering
that
he
had
ruled
the
Noxian
High
Command
since
before
the
time
of
King
Jarvan
I
of
Demacia.
His
seemingly
endless
hunger
for
power
and
conquest
has
driven
Noxus
to
be
the
nightmarish
threat
to
its
neighbors
that
it
is
today.
In
more
recent
times,
the
Noxian
government
was
in
a
transition
state.
General
Boram
Darkwill
was
assassinated,
and
Noxian
High
Command
was
in
the
process
of
selecting
the
next
Grand
General.
There
was
a
power
struggle
between
the
different
Generals,
and
political
squabbles
between
their
supporters
had
broken
out
across
Noxus.
Finally,
by
defeating
challenger
Keiran
Darkwill,
Jericho
Swain
assumed
the
position
of
Grand
General
of
Noxus.
He
was
able
to
overcome
the
odds
of
the
duel
with
his
cunning
and
quick
wits.
With
the
support
of
his
allies,
namely
Darius
,
he
seized
the
highest
position
in
Noxus.
Military
Katarina
,
an
assassin
of
the
Noxian
military
Military
service
in
Noxus
is
compulsory
for
a
period
of
six
years,
with
all
of
its
citizens
retained
as
active
reservists
until
their
golden
years.
The
Noxian
High
Command
reserves
the
right
to
draft
any
of
its
citizens,
regardless
of
age,
into
military
service
in
times
of
dire
need.
Active
Noxian
military
personnel
are
afforded
a
higher
level
of
citizenship
in
Noxian
society,
and
it
is
not
uncommon
for
most
citizens
to
remain
active
in
the
military
for
ten
or
more
years.
There
is
seldom
a
lack
of
work
in
the
Noxian
military,
even
with
the
forced
quasi-peace
that
exists
between
Noxus
and
their
eternal
rivals,
the
Demacians.
Demographics
Noxus
is
a
city
that
resembles
its
inhabitants
–
dark
and
sinister.
The
foundation
of
the
city
was
built
into
a
granite
mountain,
and
a
fair
portion
of
the
city
lies
underground.
Structures
are
built
on
top
of
and
into
the
mountain
itself.
A
tremendous
man-made
moat,
filled
with
a
witches'
brew
of
foul
and
putrid
liquids,
circumnavigates
the
city;
the
moat
serves
as
a
powerful
means
of
cutting
off
access
to
Noxus
through
all
but
a
few
key
points,
which
are
heavily
guarded.
At
the
top
of
the
granite
mountain
resides
the
headquarters
of
the
Noxian
High
Command;
the
mountain
itself
vaguely
resembles
a
demonic
skull
from
a
distance.
Beyond
the
huge
city
walls
lie
the
Noxian
denizens
that
are
too
poor
(or
not
lucky
enough)
to
live
inside.
The
subterranean
city
level
of
Noxus
is
almost
as
large
as
the
top
level,
with
numerous
shops,
taverns,
and
residences
comprising
the
seedy
underbelly
of
the
notorious
city-state.
Noxus
contains
the
largest
network
of
dungeons
anywhere
on
Runeterra,
with
numerous
Noxian
nobles
claiming
ownership
over
the
various
labyrinthine
passages
and
subterranean
rooms.
Link
to
the
League
The
Noxian
High
Command
strategically
chose
not
to
oppose
the
formation
of
the
League
of
Legends
,
and
even
went
as
far
as
to
give
tepid
support
for
its
activities.
It
was
clear
to
Valoran's
power
brokers
that
Noxus
could
read
the
writing
on
the
wall:
to
oppose
the
League,
especially
with
the
vast
majority
of
Valoran
behind
its
formation,
would
have
been
tantamount
to
suicide.
By
supporting
its
formation,
Noxus
achieved
two
ends.
Firstly,
Noxus
would
have
some
degree
of
forced
peace
between
itself
and
Demacia.
This
would
allow
Noxus
to
focus
its
efforts
on
conquest
elsewhere,
though
its
track
record
in
this
conquest
since
the
formation
of
the
League
has
been
considerably
underwhelming.
Secondly,
Noxus
would
focus
its
considerable
magic
talent
into
the
League,
allowing
for
a
potentially
greater
degree
of
success
in
conflicts
against
the
Demacians.
To
date,
the
endless
war
with
Demacia
has
been
just
that
–
endless.
The
Noxian
conflict
with
Demacia
has,
for
the
most
part,
surrogated
itself
into
the
Fields
of
Justice
for
considerably
less
cost
in
material
and
manpower.
While
its
mortal
foe
has
been
able
to
relax
some,
Noxus
has
been
able
to
relax
considerably
more
without
the
iron
fist
of
Demacia
looming
overhead.
In
more
recent
times,
the
Noxians'
Barbarian
Pacification
Campaign
was
halted
when
the
barbarians
allied
themselves
to
Freljord
,
the
newly
ascended
city-state.
The
Noxians
were
forced
to
recall
their
troops
in
abidance
to
the
League
rules.
Noxus
had
also
lost
its
rematch
against
Ionia
and
returned
their
hold
on
the
southern
provinces
back
to
the
island
city-state.
Noxus
later
got
into
a
short
war
with
Demacia
in
the
village
of
Kalamanda
.
Escalation
of
the
war
was
prevented
due
to
League
intervention.
Ties
with
Zaun
The
city
shares
a
friendly
relationship
with
the
city-state
of
Zaun
.
The
Noxian
High
Command
would
often
summon
Zaunite
champions
to
fight
in
the
League
on
their
nation's
behalf.
In
addition,
Noxus
assists
Dr.
Mundo,
the
Madman
of
Zaun
,
in
his
ambition
to
create
the
perfect
science-enhanced
killer.
They
have
provided
the
doctor
a
laboratory
within
their
city
and
have
given
him
free
reign
to
pursue
his
life's
work
in
his
spare
time.
Mercenaries
from
the
city
were
also
recruited
by
Noxus
during
their
invasion
of
Ionia,
the
two
most
heinous
of
them
being
Singed,
the
Mad
Chemist
,
and
Warwick,
the
Blood
Hunter
.
The
brand
of
mass
death
and
destruction
these
two
madmen
unleashed
remains
a
festering
scar
on
Ionian
history.
When
the
necromantic
reanimation
of
Urgot,
the
Headsman's
Pride
,
proved
problematic
for
Noxus
due
to
his
lifetime
of
injuries,
a
prevailing
scholar
of
Zaun
named
Professor
Stanwick
Pididly
provided
the
solution
by
forging
a
new
body
for
the
headman.
History
Zaunite
Trade
Relations
Improve
At
the
base
of
the
Ironspike
Mountains,
along
the
main
trade
route
between
Zaun
and
Noxus,
there
lies
two
smaller
villages:
Askay
and
Meland.
For
generations
the
people
of
those
villages
had
been
embroiled
in
a
bloody
feud.
The
lawlessness
of
the
region
had
complicated
the
development
of
trade
agreements
between
the
two
city-states,
limiting
their
interaction
to
wartime
pacts
serviced
by
mercenary
contracts
and
alchemical
weapons.
However,
after
some
Noxian
intervention,
both
Askay
and
Meland
have
put
aside
their
differences
and
declared
their
allegiance
to
Noxus.
With
the
conflict
resolved,
Zaun
and
Noxus
were
now
free
to
pursue
more
thriving
peacetime
trade
relations.

A

believed
to
be

General
Boram
Darkwill
departs
from
Noxus.
The
Demacian
soldier
who
publicly
confessed
to
conspiracy
and
sabotage
in
Kalamanda
was
found
dead
in
his
cell
yesterday,
a
victim
of
Nyzer
poisoning.
Investigations
are
underway,
but
as
of
yet
Kalamanda
officials
are
at
a
loss
as
to
how
such
a
poison
managed
to
elude
the
notice
of
its
guards.
With
news
that
the
prisoner's
interrogation
was
scheduled
for
later
this
weekend,
suspicious
eyes
are
being
cast
at
the
visiting
delegations
of
Noxus
and
Demacia.
Though
representatives
from
both
city-states
denied
any
wrongdoing,
military
activity
had
visibly
increased
in
both
camps
over
the
last
few
weeks.
Perhaps
most
disturbing
of
all,
a
carriage
believed
to
contain
General
Boram
Darkwill
himself
was
seen
departing
Noxus
soon
after
the
prisoner's
fate
was
discovered.
By
all
accounts,
the
ageless,
reclusive
leader
of
Noxus
hasn't
set
foot
outside
of
the
castle
since
the
formation
of
the
League
of
Legends
over
two
decades
ago.
Boram
Darkwill
Assassinated
Swain
holds
vigil
as
the
bodies
of
fallen
Noxian
soldiers
are
put
to
flame.
General
Boram
Darkwill
and
his
accompanying
platoon
of
Raedsel
Guardsman
were
found
slain
on
the
roads
not
far
from
the
village.
Analysis
of
the
scene
indicated
that
the
entire
troop
was
eliminated
with
terrifying
efficiency.
Noxian
scouts
were
unable
to
find
any
traces
of
an
attacking
force
or
any
signs
of
survivors.
Swain
later
ordered
the
bodies
of
every
slain
Noxian
soldier
be
put
to
fire,
as
is
the
Noxian
ceremony
for
fallen
ranking
officers
in
wartime
conditions.
He
then
accused
Demacia
for
the
assault,
as
they
are
the
only
other
military
on
this
continent
which
was
capable
of
it.
In
a
public
response,
King
Jarvan
III
of
Demacia
decried
the
attack,
and
stated
that
he
did
not
order
the
assassination.
Swain
declined
Jarvan's
invitation
to
discuss
the
situation,
which
may
indicate
that
the
damage
was
already
done.
The
last
remaining
natives
of
Kalamanda,
including
the
mayor
and
his
councilmen,
were
evacuated
from
the
region.
War
in
Kalamanda
Prince
Jarvan
IV
and
General
Swain
battle
amidst
the
chaos
erupting
in
Kalamanda.
The
collective
fears
of
Valoran
were
realized
in
Kalamanda
as
the
standoff
between
Noxus
and
Demacia
escalated
to
all-out
war.
Initial
estimates
placed
casualties
in
the
hundreds.
It
appeared
that
Prince
Jarvan
IV
of
Demacia
struck
the
first
blow
against
General
Swain
of
Noxus.
According
to
eyewitnesses,
Swain
was
making
his
usual
rounds
of
the
Noxian
camp
when
he
was
ambushed
by
Jarvan.
The
two
became
locked
in
combat,
and
soldiers
from
both
camps
immediately
engaged
each
other
in
efforts
to
come
to
their
aid.
Though
battle
between
these
embittered
rivals
has
been
heated,
ambassadors
from
both
sides
pledged
that
their
forces
would
refrain
from
the
use
of
unsanctioned
magic.
Chancellor
Malek
Hawkmoon,
spokesman
for
Noxus,
called
it
a
"steel
and
slugs"
engagement,
a
Noxian
military
term
for
a
physical-only
wartime
operation.
Neither
army
gained
a
significant
advantage
over
the
other.
The
bulk
of
the
fighting
took
place
on
the
fields
just
outside
the
village's
primary
dig
site,
though
the
contested
area
gradually
expanded.
Prince
Jarvan
was
not
seen
on
the
battlefield
since
his
initial
clash
with
Swain,
though
Noxus'
Master
Tactician
was
seen
in
the
front
lines,
issuing
commands
and
urging
his
troops
onward.
Jarvan's
absence
caused
a
great
degree
of
speculation
that
the
Prince
may
have
been
killed
or
captured,
but
the
Demacian
forces
did
not
falter.
Their
morale
was
bolstered
by
Garen
and
the
Dauntless
Vanguard,
whose
efforts
stymied
the
Noxian
offensive
at
nearly
every
turn.
King
Jarvan
III
reportedly
donned
his
own
royal
armor,
although
his
exact
position
remained
a
mystery.
It
was
likely
that
Xin
Zhao,
the
Seneschal
of
Demacia
,
was
with
him.
Kalamanda
Pacified
League
intervention
in
Kalamanda
leaves
warring
soldiers
suspended
in
time.
In
an
unprecedented
show
of
force,
the
League
of
Legends
conjured
a
temporal
stasis
bubble
over
the
entirety
of
Kalamanda,
trapping
the
warring
forces
of
Noxus
and
Demacia
in
a
mid-battle
state
of
suspension.
The
soldiers
inside
were
to
be
extracted
and
returned
to
their
homes,
but
the
League
pronounced
the
village
and
its
immediate
surroundings
uninhabitable.
The
League
had
sent
four
hundred
summoners
to
the
far
edges
of
the
Kalamanda
conflict,
transporting
with
them
a
small
nexus
that
was,
according
to
scholars
of
the
Arcanum
Majoris,
a
centerpiece
of
the
Arcanum
Vault.
Utilizing
ancient
Urtistani
techniques
refined
by
League
champion
Zilean,
the
Chronokeeper
,
these
summoners
undertook
an
enchantment
the
magnitude
of
which
hadn't
been
seen
in
Valoran
since
the
Rune
Wars.
A
great
deal
of
care
was
devoted
to
ensuring
that
Runeterra
sustained
the
least
possible
destruction
as
a
result
of
the
spell.
Though
experts
believed
the
damage
to
Runeterra
is
minimal,
they
have
determined
that
the
area
occupied
by
the
bubble
will
be
magically
unstable
for
decades.
Soldier
extraction
had
begun,
and
would
continue
for
several
weeks.
It
was
a
slow
and
intensive
process,
as
Zilean
believed
improper
extraction
may
lead
to
chrono-displasia,
a
disease
he
himself
endured.
League
surveyors
were
dispatched
to
the
village
to
assess
the
true
extent
of
the
damage,
as
well
as
to
determine
if
there
would
be
any
way
to
speed
its
restoration.
The
League
made
arrangements
for
the
families
of
Kalamanda
residents,
accepting
responsibility
for
restricting
them
from
their
own
homes.

took
residence
in
the
Institute
of
War
and
negotiated
the
safe
return
of
their
soldiers,
as
well
as
terms
for
a
peaceful
resolution
to
the
conflict.
Noxus
Cries
Havoc
While
a
history
draped
in
the
glory
of
combat
has
hardened
the
citizenry
of
Noxus
with
the
expectation
of
loss,
Noxus
stands
in
the
wake
of
a
truly
unprecedented
event
in
Noxus'
proud
nation's
history.
Never
before
has
a
General
of
the
High
Command
been
struck
down
so
cruelly
or
senselessly.
Noxus'
ancient
rivals
–
having
stooped
lower
than
ever
in
their
thirst
for
our
blood
–
have
awakened
in
us
a
rage
beyond
comprehension.
Day
and
night,
the
howl
of
our
citizen
soldiers
can
be
heard
echoing
through
the
streets
and
alleys
amid
the
drums
of
war
and
the
sharpening
of
blades.
The
forges
shall
burn
long
into
the
night
as
the
war
machine
of
Noxus
turns!
While
the
High
Council
of
Equity
has,
in
their
infinite
wisdom,
seen
fit
to
intercede
against
Noxus
on
behalf
of
these
violators
of
the
League's
peace,
the
people
of
Noxus
remain
defiant
as
ever.
With
our
Eternal
General
Boram
Darkwill
struck
down,
we
rally
to
the
side
of
our
esteemed
council
of
commanders.
The
members
of
the
High
Command
have
put
aside
their
personal
vendettas
for
honor's
sake,
instead
focusing
their
efforts
on
a
single,
shared
agenda:
to
revenge
a
wrongdoing
against
our
Empire
and
the
people's
pride
that
cannot
be
allowed
to
stand.
While
Noxus'
counterattack
might
be
stymied
by
League
intervention
for
the
time
being,
they
cannot
change
the
resolve
that
beats
in
the
heart
of
this
defiant
warrior
of
the
Empire.
Proclaiming
Noxus
fervor
unmerited,
they
would
bid
us
do
nothing
while
they
squabble
and
debate
over
the
right
course.
If
this
is
an
unjust
war
it
is
one
begat
through
the
hypocrisy
of
a
state
founded
pretense
of
virtue,
but
the
practice
of
treachery.
It
was
Demacia's
own
crown
prince
that
struck
the
first
blow
after
Noxus'
legions
held
their
disciplined
reserve
following
their
leader's
assassination.
The
League's
accusations
of
warmongering
are
as
slanderous
as
they
are
unfounded,
and
their
refusal
to
serve
justice
against
these
self-righteous
murders
will
not
be
soon
forgotten
within
our
hallowed
walls.
The
time
for
discourse
has
passed.
A
storm
is
coming.
And
our
memory
is
long.
Forever
strong!
Ivory
Ward
Marketplace
Destroyed
A
midnight
battle
leaves
Noxus'
Ivory
Ward
Marketplace
in
a
state
of
ruin.
During
the
night,
a
battle
erupted
within
Noxus
'
famous
Ivory
Ward
marketplace
late
last
week,
devastating
the
area's
main
square.
Noxian
authorities
have
ruled
the
fight
a
political
squabble
related
to
the
turmoil
still
raging
in
High
Command
after
the
death
of
Boram
Darkwill.
The
black
of
night
shrouded
the
whole
of
the
Ivory
Ward
when
guards
responded
to
the
disturbance
in
the
marketplace
area.
The
Ivory
Ward
itself
is
one
of
the
oldest
and
most
wealthy
districts
in
Noxus,
and
military-assigned
guards
in
the
area
are
sparse
because
its
tenants
typically
hire
private
security.
Noxus
has
seen
an
increase
in
outbreaks
of
violence
since
the
assassination
of
Boram
Darkwill,
as
his
death
has
High
Command
in
turmoil
over
the
rightful
successor
to
his
title.
The
power
struggle
has
trickled
down
into
the
rest
of
Noxus
as
citizens
take
arms
in
support
of
the
various
Generals
vying
for
the
seat
of
the
Grand
General.
The
compromised
marketplace
remains
under
investigation
by
Noxian
authorities,
and
residents
of
the
Ivory
Ward
have
drastically
increased
their
security.
No
casualties
have
been
confirmed,
but
one
merchant
whose
stock
was
destroyed,
Vexus
Nirac,
has
not
been
seen
since
the
day
before
the
marketplace
battle.
Swain
returns
to
Noxian
High
Command
The
turmoil
in
Noxus
following
the
death
of
Grand
General
Boram
Darkwill
intensified
this
week
when
Jericho
Swain
returned
to
High
Command.
Upon
his
arrival,
the
Master
Tactician
gained
the
immediate
support
of
Noxus's
prominent
military
figures,
positioning
him
as
the
strongest
rival
to
Keiran
Darkwill
for
leadership
of
Noxus.
The
seat
of
the
Grand
General
has
remained
vacant
since
the
death
of
Boram
Darkwill.
Over
the
past
weeks,
the
controversy
over
Darkwill's
succession
turned
to
outright
hostility.
Many
of
Noxus's
notorious
and
powerful
soldiers
stepped
forward
in
an
attempt
to
lay
claim
to
the
title.
Thus
far,
none
have
remained
alive
long
enough
to
maintain
control
over
the
city-state.
Keiran
Darkwill,
the
late
Grand
General's
youngest
son,
remains
one
of
the
more
ruthless
aspirants
in
this
dispute.
He
has
successfully
thwarted
several
assassination
attempts,
struck
down
his
challengers,
and
rallied
significant
support
behind
his
name.
Only
Darius
,
one
of
Noxus's
most
respected
and
feared
Generals,
has
earned
as
much
of
a
following
within
High
Command
as
Keiran
Darkwill.
Many
predicted
the
two
would
inevitably
clash
and
that
the
victor
would
rise
to
the
throne.
Upon
Jericho
Swain's
return,
General
Darius
forged
an
immediate
alliance
with
the
famed
Master
Tactician
and
with
this,
High
Command
has
become
even
more
divided
with
those
siding
between
Keiran
Darkwill
and
Jericho
Swain.
Swain
Seizes
Power

Noxus
Katarina
and
Talon
arrive
in
Noxus
to
witness
Swain's
coronation
as
Grand
General.
Jericho
Swain
defeated
Keiran
Darkwill
in
a
duel
contesting
the
leadership
of
Noxus
last
night,
winning
the
support
of
High
Command.
Despite
rumors
of
involvement
with
the
Institute
of
War's
scandal
in
Kalamanda
,
Swain
has
been
named
Grand
General
–
the
highest
position
in
Noxus.
Swain
as
the
Grand
General
of
Noxus
High
Command
remained
divided
in
support
between
the
two
men
since
Swain
returned
earlier
this
month.
Keiran
Darkwill
challenged
Swain
to
a
duel
to
settle
the
dispute,
claiming
that
such
a
standstill
was
a
"coward's
game."
Many
members
of
High
Command
believed
this
to
be
a
strong
move
and
expected
Keiran,
a
notoriously
skilled
duelist,
to
win.
Keiran
intially
had
the
upper
hand
but
due
to
Swain's
magical
tactics,
Keiran
surprisingly
lost.
The
gathered
members
of
High
Command
unanimously
agreed
to
swear
loyalty
to
the
Master
Tactician.
With
none
remaining
to
protest
his
claim,
High
Command
named
Jericho
Swain
the
Grand
General
of
Noxus.While
High
Command
has
embraced
his
rule,
Swain's
leadership
remains
controversial
in
Noxus's
lower
houses.
Some
accuse
Swain
of
willing
participation
in
Heywan
Relivash's
scheme
to
obtain
Kalamanda.

Trivia
The
city-state
motto
for
Noxians
is,
"Forever
strong!"
The
former
leader
of
Noxus,
General
Boram
Darkwill,
was
believed
to
have
been
assassinated
by
Demacian
forces
shortly
before
the
major
conflict
in
Kalamanda
.
Noxus
has
a
team
called
the
"Crimson
Elite",
which
is
the
Noxian
counter
to
the
Demacian
"Commandos".
Talon
was
the
first
member
revealed
to
be
on
the
team,
the
second
one
being
Riven
.
The
skins
are
likely
not
part
of
the
official
lore.
Katarina
has
an
unreleased
Crimson
Elite
skin,
meaning
she
is
likely
a
part
of
the
Crimson
Elite.
The
name
"Noxus"
may
be
based
on
the
Latin
word
"Nox",
which
means
"night"
or
"darkness".
The
Thornmail
and
the
Vampiric
Scepter
are
artifacts
of
Noxus.
