Hybrid
refers
to
using
two
or
more
champion
build
types.
These
combinations
can
be
beneficial,
and
can
allow
a
champion
to
be
more
diverse
in
terms
of
its
combat
effectiveness.

Forms
of
Hybrids
Typically
there
are
different
types
of
how
the
term
Hybrid
can
be
thought
of.
Ability
Power
/
Attack
Damage
Hybrid
This
is
the
common
form.
Champions
of
this
category
usually
build
both
AD
and
AP
in
order
to
be
effective.
Noteworthy
AP/AD
Hybrids:
Akali
Evelynn
Jax
Kayle
Poppy
Skarner
Taric
Common
items
used:
Blade
of
the
Ruined
King
Guinsoo's
Rageblade
Hextech
Gunblade
Nashor's
Tooth
Trinity
Force
On-Hit
/
Attack
Speed
Hybrid
These
champions
utilize
attack
speed
and
on-hit
effects
in
order
to
be
lethal
in
combat.
They
often
also
scale
well
with
ability
power
and
benefit
more
from
magic
penetration
than
armor
penetration
,
due
to
most
on-hit
effects
dealing
magic
damage
except
Blade
of
the
Ruined
King
.
This
Hybrid
form
works
decent
on
champions
like:
Diana
Fizz
Kayle
Kog'Maw
Lulu
Teemo
Varus
Warwick
Common
items
used:
Nashor's
Tooth
Wit's
End
Runaan's
Hurricane
Sorcerer's
Shoes
Blade
of
the
Ruined
King
Other
Other
Hybrid
forms
are
champions
that
can
be
either
built
AD
or
AP
and
are
mostly
underwhelming
if
mixed.
Should
specialize
either
on
attack
damage
or
ability
power.
Champions
like:
Corki
Ezreal
Gangplank
Katarina
Kennen
Malzahar
Miss
Fortune
Nasus
Nidalee
Shaco
Sion
Tristana
Twisted
Fate
Udyr
In
this
context,
some
people
mention
Fiora
to
be
effective
with
on-hit
effects
,
because
her
ultimate
applies
them.
Similar
to
Warwick
,
with
whom
it
is
not
uncommon
to
purchase
Sorcerer's
Shoes
,
Blade
of
the
Ruined
King
is
a
viable
choice
on
her
after
purchasing
standard
AD
items
such
as
The
Brutalizer
and
The
Bloodthirster
.
