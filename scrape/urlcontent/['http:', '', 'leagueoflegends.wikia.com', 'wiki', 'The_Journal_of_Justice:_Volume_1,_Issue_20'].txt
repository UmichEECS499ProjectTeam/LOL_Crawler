Reinforcements
Arrive
in
Kalamanda
Many
local
citizens
abandon
the
village
in
fear
Quinton
Groat
reporting
from
the
Kalamanda
Tammy
Cloris
stops
to
answer
questions
as
refugees
of
Kalamanda
flee
the
village.
The
situation
in
Kalamanda
has
grown
dire
as
reinforcements
pour
in
from
both
Noxus
and
Demacia
.
Spokesmen
from
both
delegations
have
promised
that
the
troops
are
merely
arriving
to
ensure
the
protection
of
the
important
city-state
leaders
present.
Both
encampments
await
the
interrogation
of
the
Demacian
prisoner
who
confessed
to
framing
Noxus
for
the
sabotage
of
a
Demacian
mine.
The
interrogation
has
been
delayed
at
the
request
of
King
Jarvan
III
of
Demacia,
without
any
public
explanation.
The
steady
influx
of
soldiers
has
transformed
the
Kalamanda
countryside,
dotting
it
with
military
tents
and
banners.
At
the
same
time,
Kalamanda
villagers
have
been
leaving
the
region
in
droves,
many
abandoning
their
homes
and
possessions
for
fear
of
imminent
violence.
“They
keep
saying
there’s
nothing
to
worry
about,
that
the
League
won’t
let
anything
happen
to
us.
But
what
can
the
League
do
about
the
armies
gathering
on
our
doorsteps?”
asked
Tammy
Cloris,
departing
Kalamanda
with
her
husband
and
three
children.
The
leaders
of
both
delegations
have
remained
largely
removed
from
the
public
eye.
Some
villagers
reported
seeing
General
Swain
stalking
the
perimeter
of
the
mines
at
night,
but
he
hasn’t
officially
stepped
outside
his
camp
since
Mayor
Anson
Ridley
granted
the
King
of
Demacia’s
request
for
postponement
of
the
interrogation.
On
the
Demacian
side,
neither
the
King
nor
the
Prince
have
been
seen
outside
the
Royal
Tent
at
all,
prompting
some
to
wonder
if
they
even
remain
in
the
village.
“Those
Demacians
are
up
to
something.
They
seemed
pretty
agitated
when
the
prisoner
came
forward.
I
think
it’s
pretty
suspicious
that
the
squeaky
clean
king
needed
to
put
off
questioning
the
prisoner,”
stated
Yorn
Flimmey,
one
of
Kalamanda’s
volunteer
watchmen,
“What’s
an
innocent
guy
need
so
much
extra
time
for?
I’d
love
to
know
what
Jarvan
said
to
Ridley
to
accept
these
terms.”
The
mayor
has
not
answered
any
questions
to
that
effect,
but
he
has
asked
the
citizens
of
Kalamanda
to
remain
calm.
According
to
him,
“both
delegations
have
been
respectful
and
cooperative
with
regards
to
Kalamanda’s
investigation.
There
is
no
reason
to
doubt
either
of
their
commitments
to
discovering
the
truth.”
The
prisoner
himself
has
been
kept
under
careful
lock
and
key,
and
only
Ridley’s
most
trusted
men
have
been
allowed
anywhere
near
him.
“It
is
critical
that
we
handle
this
properly,
and
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
we
need
time
to
do
that.”
Ridley
assured,
“We
all
want
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
this,
and
we
are
proceeding
as
quickly
as
possible.”
Heimerdinger
Denounced
by
Yordle
Peer
Revered
Inventor
becomes
the
target
of
criticism
at
the
Yordle
Academy
Henril
Dreving
reporting
from
Piltover
The
Yordle
Academy
of
Science
&
Progress
gained
attention
in
Piltover
this
week
when
League
Champion
and
Academy
founder
Heimerdinger
was
publically
denounced
by
Rumble
,
a
yordle
mechanic
from
Bandle
City
.
Rumble
accused
the
Revered
Inventor
of
selling
out
advanced
yordle
technology
for
human
gain
and
proclaimed
himself
the
new
face
of
yordle
superiority
in
the
field.
Heimerdinger
reportedly
received
a
'yawper,'
a
yordle
communication
device
for
broadcasting
vocal
messages
over
a
large
distance,
from
Bandle
City
yesterday
morning.
"Heimerdinger
gets
yawpers
all
the
time,"
said
Dominic
Hadley,
a
human
student
and
page
to
the
Revered
Inventor
at
the
Academy.
"They're
usually
from
fans
or
his
colleagues
abroad—especially
those
in
Bandle
City—but
this
one
was
different."
According
to
witnesses
at
the
Academy,
this
particular
contraption
had
been
engineered
to
broadcast
its
recorded
message
to
every
capable
communication
device
within
a
one-mile
radius.
When
Heimerdinger
activated
the
yawper,
nearly
all
present
at
the
Academy
heard
its
message.
The
final
portion
is
transcribed
below:
"Heimerdinger—your
'revered
inventor'—is
nothing
but
a
sellout!
Like
a
hextech
lapdog
for
human
masters,
he
gives
away
superior
yordle
innovations—and
for
what?
For
what?
A
pat
on
the
head?
He
isn't
a
leader;
he's
a
pathetic
disgrace
to
Bandle
City
and
to
all
yordles
everywhere!
I,
Rumble,
will
soon
demonstrate
the
true
power
of
yordle
technology
without
the
hold
of
a
human
leash!
Prepare
yourselves!"
Despite
the
intensity
of
the
message,
Heimerdinger
himself
was
not
perturbed.
"Perhaps
the
Academy’s
title
is
misleading!
This
is
a
place
for
progress
and
for
all
who
seek
it.
Race
and
point
of
origin
are
not
variables
in
the
equation.
Rumble
has
one
hundred
percent
miscalculated
our
intentions!"
Following
the
incident,
contacts
in
Bandle
City
reported
that
the
name
Rumble
is
fairly
well-known
amongst
local
yordles.
As
it
turns
out,
Rumble
has
been
called
a
‘born
mechanic’
himself:
"I
recommended
him
to
the
Yordle
Academy
a
few
years
ago,"
said
Flindle
Waldor,
one
of
Heimerdinger's
Bandle
City-based
colleagues
and
Rumble’s
former
teacher.
"But
he
wouldn't
go!
Bit
of
a
disappointment,
if
you
ask
me.
The
boy
made
up
for
what
he
lacked
in
size
with
pure
brainpower,
and
he
could’ve
had
real
success
if
he
wasn’t
such
a
hothead!”
Despite
his
message
to
Piltover,
Bandle
City
reports
that
Rumble's
current
whereabouts
are
unknown.
"He
left
his
workshop
abandoned
two
months
ago
and
no
one's
seen
him
since,"
said
Waldor.
"Took
all
of
his
tools
and
vanished."
Security
at
the
Academy
has
been
slightly
elevated,
but
Bandle
City
investigators
report
that
their
leads
on
Rumble
himself,
for
the
most
part,
have
run
cold.
The
dissenting
yordle
mechanic's
next
move
remains
to
be
seen.
The
Eye
Inside
Fires!
Fiends!
Foolishness!
Ram
Steed
your
eye
inside
the
League
of
Legends
As
promised,
yours
truly
had
been
on
the
quest
to
bring
you,
the
reader,
the
truth
as
I
never
have
before.
A
new
champion
has
recently
entered
the
League
of
Legends,
a
mysterious
and
dangerous
champion
who
blazes
with
the
anger
of
the
sun.
His
name
is
Brand
.
For
his
destructive
nature,
he
has
been
kept
under
lock
and
key
by
the
summoners
of
the
Institute
of
War
,
hidden
away
from
the
good
people
of
Valoran
.
Until
now.
My
requests
to
speak
with
the
Burning
Vengeance
were
initially
denied.
Then,
they
were
denied
again,
and
so
on.
However,
my
recent
experiences
have
created
in
me
a
determination
that
cannot
be
thwarted.
Calling
in
favors
and
using
tricks
I
can't
reveal,
I
was
finally
granted
an
audience
with
Brand
so
that
I
could
ask
him
ten
questions.
No
more,
no
less.
Again,
I
go.
While
the
Champion
in
question
is
equally
as
dangerous
as
Shaco
,
this
time
I
am
guarded
by
a
negatron
cage
and
the
agents
of
the
League
itself.
I
learn
from
my
mistakes.
10
Questions
with
Brand
Ram
:
“Thank
you
for
agreeing
to
this
interview
Brand.
There
are
many
across
Valoran
who
are
keen
to
hear
your
story.”
Brand
:
[
Unleashes
a
conflagration,
trying
desperately
to
burn
me
through
the
invisible
walls
of
his
cell.
]
Ram:
“You
can
talk
to
me
or
I
can
leave
you
here.
Alone.
Again.
Your
choice.”
Brand:
[
Settles
down
a
little
and
begins
to
pace.
]
“If
this
is
my
only
stimulation,
fine.”
Ram:
“Let's
start
with
the
question
on
everyone's
mind:
what
are
you?”
Brand:
“What
do
you
think
I
am?”
Ram:
“A
fire-mage
who
went
too
far?
Some
sort
of
possessing
entity?
A
murderous
madman
who
lit
himself
on
fire?
These
have
all
been
posed.”
Brand:
“No!
I
am
something
far
greater!
I
am
the
Burning
Vengeance!”
Ram:
“But
what
exactly
is
that?”
Brand:
“A
primal
elemental
spirit,
fool.
Can
you
understand
that?”
Ram:
“So,
if
you're
a
spirit,
then
that
isn't
your
body.
Whose
is
it?”
Brand:
“It
hardly
matters.”
Ram:
“Again,
whose
body
do
you
wear?
Brand:
“His
name
was
Kegan
Rodhe.
He
came
from
a
land
you
know
as
Lokfar.
He
was
a
sea-raider.
He
was
a
violent
and
fool-hardy
man.”
Ram:
“Is
there
anything
left
of
Kegan
in
there?
If
you
were
to
be
driven
out,
would
he
return?”
Brand:
“Your
summoners
cannot
drive
me
out.
They
have
already
tried.”
Ram:
“But
that
does
not
answer
the
question.”
Brand:
[
Silent.
]
Ram:
“Okay,
then.
Is
Brand
your
real
name?
It
seems
a
little
on-the-nose.”
Brand:
“My
real
name
is
not
anything
you
could
understand.
This
name
says
what
it
needs
to
say.
That
is
enough.”
Ram:
“How
did
you
come
into
being?
I
mean,
we're
born
from
parents
and
even
the
Cryophoenix
has
an
origin.
What's
yours?”
Brand:
“I
was
born
with
the
world.
At
first,
I
flowed
through
it.
Then,
I
flowed
into
it
and
took
a
body.
Then,
my
purpose
became
plain.”
Ram:
“And
that
is...”
Brand:
“To
purify
the
world.
To
renew
it.
To
burn
it
down
again
and
again
to
make
way
for
what
is
to
come.
That's
what
your
League
doesn't
understand.
I
am
not
evil.
I
am
nature.
I
am
necessary.”
Ram:
“So
how
did
you
come
to
be
here
in
Valoran?
You
are
primal
and
the
body
you've
stolen
comes
from
a
far-off
continent.
It
seems
strange.”
Brand:
“The
hellish
waters
of
this
world
dragged
me
here.
I
am
nature.
I
go
where
I
must.”
Ram:
“Fighting
in
the
League
of
Legends
seems
like
an
odd
choice.
Why
are
you
here?”
Brand:
“Does
this
prison
not
say
it
all!
I
am
forced
to
do
this.
I
have
no
choice.
I
am
a
slave
of
your
League,
muzzled
like
a
dog.
I
am
forced
to
deny
my
purpose
and
contain
my
power.
And
only
until
your
summoners
find
a
way
to
destroy
me,
which
they
research
as
we
speak.”
Ram:
“It
is
rumored
that
you
were
imprisoned
in
Lokfar
for
millennia,
which
is
perhaps
why
no
one
has
ever
seen
you
before.
If
those
who'd
imprisoned
you
couldn't
find
a
way
to
destroy
you
then,
do
you
think
there's
a
way
to
do
so
now?”
Brand:
“Why
would
I
answer
a
foolish
question
like
that?”
Ram:
“Because
sometimes
it's
as
much
in
what
you
don't
say
as
what
you
do
say.
Last
question.
If
there
was
one
thing
you
wanted
the
people
of
Valoran
to
know,
what
would
it
be?”
Brand:
“Your
League
of
Legends
is
not
what
you
think
it
is
and
your
summoners
are
not
heroes.
Beware.”
And
at
that,
I
was
escorted
by
my
League
representative
out
of
the
building.
Fortunately,
my
questions
were
answered.
However,
other
questions
have
been
posed.
Why
is
the
League
forcing
such
a
being
to
fight
instead
of
simply
holding
him
prisoner?
What
did
Brand
mean
by
his
parting
words?
Why
was
the
League
so
eager
to
have
me
removed
once
they
were
said?
It
sounds
like
there's
more
truth
to
be
uncovered.
Sounds
like
a
job
for
Ram
Steed.
Until
next
time,
faithful
readers.

Valoran’s
most
pressing
questions!
Senior
Summoner
Ralston
Farnsley
commenting
from
the
Institute
of
War
It
often
seems
that
we
Runeterrans
are
poised
on
the
brink
of
disaster.
I
believe
that
it’s
important
to
remember
the
good
we’re
capable
of,
and
the
things
we’ve
achieved
by
cooperating
with
each
other.
To
the
many
of
you
who
are
concerned
about
what’s
happening
in
Kalamanda:
have
faith
in
the
League,
it
exists
for
a
reason.
“As
a
summoner,
I’ve
noticed
all
champions
are
of
roughly
equal
strength,
I
wonder
if
the
League
has
ever
denied
a
champion
for
being
too
weak,
or
in
fact,
too
strong.
Has
a
foolhardy
summoner
ever
attempted
to
"forcefully
extract"
a
champion
who
is
too
powerful
for
the
League
from
another
plane?”
–
Summoner
Harlon
Nayl
Champions
are
some
of
the
most
formidable
warriors
alive.
They
battle
each
other
every
day.
A
creature
may
seem
unstoppable
when
it
joins
the
League,
but
eventually
the
other
champions
learn
how
to
fight
it.
Some
champions
are
indeed
summoned
from
other
planes
to
exploit
their
powers,
but
it
has
been
illegal
to
perform
such
a
summoning
without
permission
from
the
League
for
quite
some
time.
“It
is
awesome
to
know
that
Mother
Nature
finally
has
a
real
soldier
that
will
teach
all
those
reckless
mages
the
pains
of
their
thoughtless
actions.
I
am
curious
though,
do
you
actively
participate
in
rallies
for
green
movements?
Or
do
you
spend
most
of
your
time
visiting
forests
of
Runeterra
and
reminiscing
of
days
of
old?”
P.S.
I
love
the
giggles
and
cries
of
your
saplings,
is
there
a
chance
that
summoners
might
be
able
to
get
one
to
take
home
and
care
for?

Summoner
Wobbuffet2
Maokai’s
pledge
to
stand
against
the
corruptive
forces
of
magic
has
not
necessarily
made
him
one
of
the
most
popular
champions
amongst
summoners,
but
one
has
to
admire
his
conviction.
While
he
objects
to
the
magic
man
employs,
he
is
patient
with
us.
“‘Green
movements?’
This
is
an
interesting
name.
I
do
my
part
in
the
League
so
that
men
can
know
the
error
of
their
ways.
I
don’t
go
to
rallies.
I
don’t
think
I
would
be
comfortable
there.
I
am
close
to
peace
in
the
forests
of
Runeterra,
as
you
say,
but
with
this
magic
coursing
through
me,
I
can
never
truly
be
free.
As
for
your
other
question,
the
saplings
are
not
toys.
You
cannot
‘have’
one,
but
there
are
trees
all
around.
Most
have
wonderful
personalities.
You
just
need
to
take
the
time
to
notice.”
“Do
the
champions
of
the
League
receive
any
sort
of
psychological
shielding
from
the
torments
they
suffer
when
on
the
Fields
of
Justice
?
Dying
over
and
over
seems
rough
enough,
but
the
abilities
of
some
champions
in
particular
(
Malzahar

Fiddlesticks

)
seem
like
they
would
create
lasting
mental
trauma.
I
doubt
that
a
Demacian
or
a
Noxian
would
admit
weakness
by
applying
for
counseling,
but
are
such
services
provided
to
them?”
–
Tempus
Hustle
Most
services
are
made
available
to
champions.
They
can
usually
afford
the
finest
luxuries
with
what
is
provided
by
the
League,
but
psychological
trauma
is
actually
less
common
than
you
might
suspect.
Champions
are
subjected
to
Judgments
which
test
their
mental
fortitude
before
they
are
admitted
to
the
League,
and
many
have
overcome
extraordinarily
difficult
trials
in
their
pasts.
