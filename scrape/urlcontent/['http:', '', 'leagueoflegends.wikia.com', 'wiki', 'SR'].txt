Lore
The
oldest
and
most
venerated
Field
of
Justice
is
known
as
Summoner's
Rift.
The
Rift
is
located
in
a
remote
forest
between
Freljord
,
the
Serpentine
River
,
and
the
Ironspine
Mountains.
The
Summoner’s
Rift
is
one
of
a
few
locations
in
Valoran
where
magical
energy
is
at
its
greatest
concentration,
making
it

Rift.
highly
sought-after
locale
to
pursue
magical
endeavors.
Historically,
the
forest
where
the
Rift
resides
was
the
site
of
several
battles
during
Runeterra's
various
Rune
Wars.
In
modern
times,
this
battleground
is
known
as
the
ultimate
proving
ground
for
any
aspiring
summoner
.
The
Rift
is
also
the
battleground
where
some
of
Valoran's
greatest
political
decisions
have
been
made
since
the
inception
of
the
League
of
Legends
.
Gameplay
Map
of
the
Summoner's
Rift.
The
objective
of
Summoner's
Rift
is
simple
–
destroy
the
enemy
nexus.
In
order
to
do
this,
champions
must
traverse
down
one
of
three
different
paths
(or
lanes
)
in
order
to
attack
their
enemy
at
their
weakest
points
they
can
exploit.
Both
teams
have
their
lanes
defended
by
numerous
turrets
;
each
turret
grows
in
strength
the
closer
it
gets
to
its
respective
nexus
and
each
turret
must
be
eliminated
in
order
to
gain
access
to
the
next
turret
in
that
lane.
Cooperating
with
fellow
summoners
is
an
absolute
requirement
for
success,
as
it
is
easy
for
a
champion
to
find
themselves
ambushed
by
enemies
in
the
lanes
of
the
Rift.

the
top
most
brush
