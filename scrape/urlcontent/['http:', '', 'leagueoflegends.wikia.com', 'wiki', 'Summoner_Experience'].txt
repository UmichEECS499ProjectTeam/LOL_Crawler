Summoner
Experience
Summoner
Experience
is
the
reward,
together
with
Influence
Points
,
awarded
to
a
summoner
after
completing
a
game.
It
ceases
to
be
received
after
the
Summoner's
level
is
maxed
out
at
30.
The
received
Experience
Points
are
calculated
at
the
end
of
each
game;
wins
are
worth
more
than
losses,
and
the
longer
the
game
lasts,
the
more
XP
you
gain.

Increasing
experience
gain
Summoner
Experience
gain
can
be
increased
by
purchasing
an
XP
Boost
from
the
PVP.Net
store.
This
will
double
the
experience
earned
at
the
end
of
each
match.
XP
gains
There
is
both
a
minimum
and
a
maximum
amount
of
XP
and
IP
a
player
can
get
from
a
game.
A

is
won

or
before

XP
and
64

Current
(July
2011)
formula
for
XP
winning
a
Normal
game
at
level
15-19
is
roughly
3m+25,
where
m
is
the
number
of
minutes
the
game
lasts,
capped
at
198.
Intermediate
Bot
games
at
level
10-14
use
the
same
formula.
At
level
15-19,
Intermediate
Bot
games
subtract
a
25%
penalty
from
that
formula,
and
give
XP
for
only
the
first
180
minutes
a
day
of
play.

will
increase
it.

is
also
a
daily
