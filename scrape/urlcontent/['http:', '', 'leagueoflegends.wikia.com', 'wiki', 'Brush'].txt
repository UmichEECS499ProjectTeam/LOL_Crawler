New
brush
layout
and
positions
In-game
picture
of
the
Brush
Locations
of
brush
patches
in
Summoner's
Rift.
Brush
is
the
tall
grassy
terrain
on
a
map
that
provides
a
champion
(or
minion
/
monster
)
a
form
of
stealth
.
Upon
entering
the
brush,
the
unit
immediately
turns
invisible
to
enemies
outside
of
that
particular
patch
of
brush.
The
unit
will
remain
invisible
until
it
has
either
left
the
brush
or
was
scouted
by
an
ability,
item
or
an
enemy
unit.
This
stealth
does
not
make
your
champion
invisible,
but
hides
you
from
units
outside
of
that
brush.
You
will
not
be
revealed
by
stealth
detections
that
are
not
placed
in
the
brush.

Gameplay
Visually,
this
effect
manifests
when
your
champion's
avatar
takes
on
a
partially
transparent
quality.
Opposing
units
in
different
patches
of
brush
will
not
be
able
to
see
each
other
even
if
they
are
within
normal
sight
range.
Brush
can
be
used
in
several
ways
to
create
a
tactical
advantage
on
the
battlefield.
First,
and
perhaps
most
apparently,
one
can
utilize
the
brush
to
set
an
ambush
for
an
enemy
champion,
emerging
once
they
have
passed
by
to
cut
off
their
escape.
Brush
can
also
be
used,
while
fleeing,
to
break
the
line
of
sight
and
force
pursuing
champions
to
guess
which
direction
you
have
gone.
It
can
also
be
used
to
dodge
passing
minion
waves,
to
hide
your
champion
while
he
channels
recall
,
or
to
force
a
ranged
champion
too
close
to
melee
range
to
continue
their
attack.
Wards
are
subject
to
the
same
limitations
surrounding
brush
as
other
units.
A
ward
placed
inside
a
patch
of
brush
can
reveal
the
area
inside
the
brush,and
the
surrounding
of
it.
A
Vision
Ward
placed
outside
of
a
brush
will
not
be
able
to
see
enemies
inside.
Because
of
this,
it
is
often
preferable
to
place
wards
within
a
brush.
Brush
in
a
lane
can
be
used
to
find
out
if
the
enemy
has
sight
into
a
particular
patch
of
brush.
If
you
are
in
the
brush,
not
attacking,
and
minions
begin
to
attack
you,
then
they
have
sight
into
that
brush.
If
an
attack
skill
that
is
not
a
skillshot
is
used
while
in
the
brush,
the
champion
using
that
skill
will
be
revealed
for
a
short
time.
Your
champion
will
also
be
revealed
when
you
auto-attack
from
within
a
brush.
If
an
ally
attacks
from
a
brush,
you
will
also
be
seen.
Brush
is
subject
to
line
of
sight.
For
example,
on
Summoner's
Rift,
opposing
units
on
both
ends
of
the
brush
at
blue
buff
will
not
be
able
to
see
each
other
due
to
a
wall
in
between
the
edges
of
that
brush.
Ways
to
reveal
areas
in
the
Brush
There
are
several
ways
to
reveal
an
area
in
brush:
An
allied
unit
moves
into
the
brush.
This
also
includes
pets
such
as:
Annie's
Summon:
Tibbers
pet.
LeBlanc's
Mirror
Image
clone.
Mordekaiser's
Children
of
the
Grave
pet.
Shaco's
Hallucinate
clone.
Yorick's
Omen
of
Death
clone.
A
Sight
Ward
placed
in
the
brush
will
reveal
within
and
around
it
for
3
minutes.
A
Vision
Ward
placed
in
the
brush
will
reveal
the
same
area
as
a
normal
sight
ward,
but
will
also
reveal
stealthed
units.
Champion
Abilities
Some
champions
possess
abilites
that
directly
or
more
often
indirectly
let
you
see
into
an
area
that
is
usually
subject
to
the
Fog
of
War
or
units
within
them,
such
as
Brush.
Most
every
AoE
ability
could
reveal
an
opponent
in
