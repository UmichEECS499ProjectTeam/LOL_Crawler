occurs
when
a
champion
takes
sufficient
damage
to
be
reduced
to
zero
health
.
Upon
dying
,
the
summoner's
screen
is
shaded
gray,
a
death
recap
and
death
timer
are
displayed,
gold
is
rewarded
to
champions
who
earned
a
kill
or
an
assist
,
and
other
champion
or
situation-specific
events
may
occur,
as
detailed
below.
The
death
of
all
five
members
of
a
team
simultaneously
is
referred
to
as
an
ace
;
it
is
possible
for
both
teams
to
be
aced

Death
Timer
Upon
death,
every
player
must
wait
a
given
amount
of
time
noted
over
the
champions
image.
The
timer
can
be
different
for
each
champion.The
exact
formula
used
to
determine
the
death
timer's
duration
is
unknown.
What
is
known
is
the
time
spent
dead
increases
according
to
either
experience
or
champion
level
and
match
time.
On
Summoner's
Rift
the
death
timer
scales
from
12-50
seconds,
which
includes
a
base
scaling
per
champion
level
and
an
additional
scaling
after
30
minutes,
increasing
the
death
timer
by
2%
each
minute
up
to
a
50%
cap
with
a
total
timer
time
of
75
seconds.
While
the
death
timer
is
counting
down,
the
summoner
is
still
able
to
shop
for
items
,
look
around
the
map,
and
chat
with
other
teammates.
Ways
to
reduce
the
length
of
the
death
timer
include
the
following:
Revive
Quintessence
of
Revival
When
the
death
timer
reaches
zero
the
dead
champion
is
revived
on
the
summoner
platform.
Removal
of
stacks,
buffs
or
effects
Upon
death,
if
the
champion
killed
possessed
a
buff
or
had
built
up
stacks
on
one
of
a
handful
of
items,
those
effects
are
either
lost
or
transferred
to
the
killer.
If
the
champion
killed
possessed
an
innate
ability,
the
bonus
will
be
lost
for
the
duration
of
that
champion's
death.

are

Ways
to
prevent
death
when
reaching
zero
health
Effects
that
prevent
you
from
dying
always
occur
in
a
set
order:
Zilean's
Chrono
Shift
Guardian
Angel
Anivia's
Rebirth
/
Zac's
Cell
Division
/
Aatrox's
Blood

Ways
to

health

Undying

Post-death
events
Some
champions
have
abilities
that
trigger
after
their
death
or
the
death
of
another
targeted
champion,
allowing
for
limited
control
by
one
of
the
involved
parties.
These
will
only
occur
after
the
previously
mentioned
sequence
and
when
more
than
one
of
them
apply
they
will
occur
in
the
following
order.
Yorick's
Omen
of
Death
Kog'Maw's
Icathian
Surprise
/
Karthus's
Death
Defied
/
Zyra's
Rise
of
the
Thorns
Mordekaiser's
Children
of
the
Grave
Lore
When
a
champion
is
summoned
to
the
Fields
of
Justice,
their
real,
physical
form
is
summoned
there,
meaning
that
the
champions
on
the
Fields
of
Justice,
do,
in
fact
die
upon
player
death.
When
killed,
it
seems
as
though
they
are
transported
back
to
their
respective
summoning
chambers,
brought
back
to
life,
and
subsequently
returned
to
the
Field
of
Justice
to
continue
fighting.
The
following
is
an
excerpt
from
Renekton's
League
Judgement:
"Renekton
bowls
through
them,
his
blade
deflecting
bullets
fired
at
point
blank
by
a
buxom
redhead.
A
bulky
minotaur
slams
the
ground
and
a
curiously
large
armadillo
drops
down
on
all
fours
to
defend
against
the
attack,
but
they
are
no
match
for
the
crocodile
in
bloodlust.
The
defenders
are
knocked
aside
in
Renekton's
mad
dash
for
Nasus.
The
creature
charges
up
the
steps,
flying
onto
the
platform
with
enormous
momentum.
Nasus
reaches
out
to
hold
up
his
palm,
as
if
to
stop
his
brother,
when
suddenly
a
bright
ray
of
light
shoots
out,
engulfing
him
in
an
agonizing
fire.
Renekton
immediately
succumbs
to
the
darkness.
The
creature
awakens
in
a
dark
room,
sprawled
on
a
frigid
stone
floor.
A
group
of
cloaked
magicians
stand
with
their
hands
outstretched
in
a
circle
around
him.
They
murmur
strange
words
under
their
breath,
ensnaring
him
in
a
glowing
net
of
magic.
When
Renekton's
vision
clears,
he
sees
his
brother
staring
dispassionately
at
him
from
across
the
room.
Renekton
snarls,
throwing
himself
bodily
towards
Nasus,
but
the
magical
chains
that
bind
him
hold
firm.
Nasus
gazes
back
for
a
long
moment,
his
expression
unreadable.
Then
he
turns
and
steps
into
a
lighted
platform.
"
It
is
also
confirmed
in
the
Journal
of
Justice
(Volume
1,
Issue
20)
in
the
"Mailbag
of
Justice"
section
that
champions
are
revived
many
times,
and
questions
their
mental
state
after
being
exposed
to
their
own
mortality
day
after
day.
