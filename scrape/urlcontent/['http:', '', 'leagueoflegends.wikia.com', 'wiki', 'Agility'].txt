Elixir
of
Agility
was
a
consumable
item
in
League
of
Legends
.
[1]
Strategy
It
was
best
used
by
DPS
champions
that
would
benefit
from
high
attack
speed
and/or
crit
chance,
like
Tryndamere
.
It
was
most
often
bought
late
game
because
the
crit
chance
stat
needed
other
late
game
crit
items
to
be
effective.
Elixirs
are
often
bought
towards
the
end
of
long
games
when
builds
are
all
completed
and
the
extra
gold
continues
to
accumulate.
They
can
also
be
bought
mid
game
to
give
a
temporary
stat
advantage
during
ganks
and
teamfights.
Notes
Elixirs
are
automatically
applied
when
purchased
if
there
are
already
6
items
in
the
inventory.
Elixir
of
Agility
was
not
available
in
Dominion.
Trivia
The
Piece
of
Green
Candy
was
a
seasonal
item
that
replaced
the
Elixir
of
Agility
during
the
Harrowing
celebration.
It
was
the
same
item
with
a
different
name
and
a
picture.
The
Green
Tea
Kettle
was
another
seasonal
item
that
replaced
the
Elixir
of
Agility
during
the
Lunar
Revel
celebration.
The
Fury
Fungus
was
yet
another
seasonal
item
that
replaced
the
Elixir
of
Agility
during
the
Great
Hunt
.
It
was
removed
because
it
primarily
benefited
AD
carries
that
were
already
in
the
lead,
making
hyper
carries
even
stronger,
and
pigeon-holing
end-game
AD
builds
to
focus
on
critical
strikes.
