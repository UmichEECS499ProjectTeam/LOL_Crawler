The
Voodoo
Lands
are
located
just
southeast
of
the
Great
Barrier.
Lore
An
unforgiving
barren
wilderness,
the
Voodoo
Lands
were
colonized
by
political
and
social
outcasts
from
Noxus
,
known
as
the
Gray
Order,
who
sought
to
leave
their
neighbors
in
peace
as
they
pursued
dark
arcane
knowledge.
The
leaders
of
this
outcast
society
are
a
married
couple:
Gregori
Hastur,
the
Gray
Warlock,
and
his
wife
Amoline,
the
Shadow
Witch.
Though
survival
was
a
challenge
at
times,
the
Gray
Order's
colony
managed
to
thrive
in
a
land
where
so
many
others
would
have
failed.
Taming
the
Shadow
Bear
A
ferocious
shadow
bear
-
a
denizen
of
the
land's
petrified
forests
-
once
terrorized
the
colony.
This
ended
when
Gregori
and
Amoline's
daughter
Annie,
the
Dark
Child
,
miraculously
ensorcelled
the
bear,
turning
it
into
her
pet.
To
this
day
she
keeps
her
bear
Tibbers
by
her
side,
often
keeping
him
spellbound
as
a
stuffed
doll
to
be
carried
like
a
child's
toy.
