The
subject
of
this
article
was
removed
from
League
of
Legends
in
patch
V1.0.0.152
.
The
information
displayed
is
no
longer
relevant
to
League
of
Legends,
but
exists
here
for
historical
purposes.

Mastery
Tree
Other
Mastery
Trees:
Offense
·
Defense
Strength
of
Spirit
is
a
fifth
tier
Utility
mastery
with
3
ranks.
In
Season
One
,
it
was
originally
in
the
defensive
tree,
but
was
initially
removed
from
the
Season
Two
masteries;
however,
it
was
later
reintroduced
in
v1.0.0.131
,
replacing
Perseverance
.
Effect
per
rank
Increases
health
regeneration
per
5
seconds
by
0.4
/
0.7
/
1%
of
your
maximum
mana
.
Requirements
Requires
16
points
in
Utility.
Strategy
This
mastery
is
intended
for
champions
that
utilize
a
large
mana
pool
(mainly
mages)
but
occasionally
need
to
get
close
to
enemies
(perfect
examples
would
be
Singed
,
Blitzcrank
and
Ryze
).
Be
careful
when
relying
on
Strength
of
Spirit's
health
regeneration
for
your
survivability
needs.
Even
at
max
rank,
this
mastery
is
deceptively
inadequate;
it
is
meant
to
compensate
for
a
mage's
low
survivability
in
assistance
to
a
cautious
behaviour.
Low-health
mages
with
short
spell
range
typically
utilizing
this
mastery
are
wiser
than
keeping
too
close
to
enemies.
Keep
in
mind
that
since
Strength
of
Spirit
scales
with
maximum
mana,
it
would
not
compare
to
the
effectiveness
of
health
regeneration
items
:
they
immediately
increase
health
regeneration
and
also
provide
other
beneficial
effects.
It
is
exceptionally
strong
on
Ryze
as
he
normally
ends
up
with
large
amounts
of
mana
since
his
abilities
scale
with
maximum
mana
as
well.
Accordingly,
it
synergizes
well
with
spell
vamp
effects.
Notes
The
effect
is
based
off
the
champion's
total
maximum
mana,
including
mana
increases
from
masteries,
runes
and
items.
The
maximum
HP
Regen
per
5
that
can
be
gained
in
the
game
utilizing
Strength
of
Spirit
is
approximately
76.33
from
the
maximum
possible
mana
of
7632.765.
