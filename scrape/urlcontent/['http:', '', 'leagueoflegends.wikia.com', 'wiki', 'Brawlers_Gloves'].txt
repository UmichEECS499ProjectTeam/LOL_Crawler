involved,
they're
simply
described
as
short."

Background
In
a
small
village
just
south
of
the
vast
moors
of
Nolir,
an
old
craftsman
works
long
nights
to
provide
a
much
needed
service
to
bandits
and
thieves
in
neighboring
cities.
He
uses
the
hide
of
a
rare
lizard
that
is
as
tough
and
durable
as
rock,
adorning
with
blistering
steel
to
create
a
pair
of
gloves
worth
fighting
for.
Strategy
Getting
Brawler's
Gloves
on
champions
who
have
a
ranged
on-hit
effect
ability
such
as
Gangplank's
Parrrley
can
lead
to
devastating
damage
early
game.
Tryndamere
also
benefits
from
starting
with
Brawler's
Gloves
due
to
his
reliance
on
critical
hits.
Combined
with
critical
damage
runes
,
Brawler's
Gloves
can
lead
to
an
extremely
easy
first
blood
when
used
with
champions
who
have
attack
damage
boosts
such
as
Sion's
Enrage
.
