Ability
Details
Time
Bomb
can
target
a
single
unit,
either
ally
or
enemy.
An
exploding
bomb
is
an
area
of
effect
at
its
last
location.
Applies
spell
effects
as
an
area
of
effect
ability.
Spell
vamp
is
reduced
to
one-third
effectiveness.
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
will
apply
a
15%
slow.
Magic
damage
will
be
mitigated
by
Black
Shield
and
Lifeline
.
Spell
shields
will
only
block
the
placement
of
a
bomb.
Spell
shields
will
not
block
the
detonation
nor
the
damage
in
any
circumstance.
Additional
Information:
Time
Bomb
will
cancel
an
enemy
champions
recall.
If
a
bomb
is
placed
on
a
stealthed
ally,
it
will
not
be
visible
to
the
enemy
team.
A
ticking
bomb
will
draw
turret
aggro.
A
ticking
bomb
does
not
grant
an
assist
if
the
target
dies
before
it
explodes.
A
bomb
will
detonate
an
enemy
Zilean's
bomb
when
placed
on
the
same
unit.
This
does
not
prevent
the
enemy's
damage.
If
a
bomb
carrier
takes
lethal
damage
and
triggers
a
revive
effect,
such
as
Chrono
Shift
or
Guardian
Angel
,
the
bomb
is
removed
like
all
other
debuffs.
A
ticking
bomb
will
still
detonate
even
if
the
carrier
becomes
untargetable.
The
carrier
will
still
take
damage
unless
they
are
also
invulnerable,
through
effects
such
as
Frozen
Tomb
or
Zhonya's
Hourglass
.
Various
champions
that
have
abilities
that
make
them
untargetable
can
prevent
the
damage
from
Time
Bomb,
such
as
Vladimir,
Elise,
Fizz,
Lissandra,
Shaco,
Fiora,
Zed,
Master
Yi,
or
Maokai.
