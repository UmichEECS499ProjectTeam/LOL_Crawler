Null-Magic
Mantle
is
the
item
from
which
the
magic
resistance
gold
value
is
derived,
and
as
such,
it
derives
a
value
of
20
gold
per

of
magic
resistance.

Strategy
The
+20
magic
resistance
can
be
a
lot
in
the
early
game
phase,
since
it
nearly
doubles
the
amount
of
magic
resistance
most
champions
have.
This
makes
it
very
effective
when
laning
against
high
magic
dealing
characters.
