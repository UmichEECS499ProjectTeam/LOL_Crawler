Skill
usage
A
quick
Howling
Gale
followed
by
a
Zephyr
and
an
auto-attack
while
the
enemy
is
in
the
air
is
an
effective
harassment
method,
as
it
is
relatively
safe
from
retaliation
due
to
the
amount
of
CC
applied.
Bear
in
mind
the
gigantical
mana
cost
of
Howling
Gale
.
Zephyr
cost
on
the
other
hand
is
very
affordable
Quickly
firing
a
Howling
Gale
without
the
charge
up
can
be
used
to
heavily
disable
the
other
team.
The
knockup
from
Howling
Gale
and
the
knock
back
from
Monsoon
will
interrupt
channeled
ultimates
such
as
Requiem
,
Death
Lotus
,
and
Idol
Of
Durand
.
Howling
Gale
can
be
used
for
farming
after
building
AP
.
It
is
also
a
great
harassing
ability
against
champions
that
stand
behind
their
minions.
Janna
can
finish
off
wounded
enemies
with
Howling
Gale
with
its
deceptively
long
range.
When
Howling
Gale
is
charging
in
the
brush
,
it
is
visible
to
the
enemy.
But
once
the
gale
proceeds
it
will
become
invisible
until
it
comes
out
from
the
brush.
Because
you
lose
your
movement
speed
boost
after
firing
Zephyr
,
consider
the
consequences
of
doing
so.
When
you're
escaping
from
an
enemy
gank,
keeping
Zephyr's
passive
may
be
more
useful
than
activating
Zephyr
to
slow
down
your
enemy
and
losing
the
movement
speed
bonus.
Because
Zephyr
allows
Janna
to
move
through
units,
she
can
easily
harass
enemy
champions
while
using
their
minions
as
an
obstacle.
Doing
so
will
result
in
drawing
minion
aggro,
so
it
is
beneficial
to
self-cast
Eye
Of
The
Storm
when
under
attack.
Eye
Of
The
Storm
can
be
used
on
allied
turrets,
thereby
making
it
an
excellent
defense.
The
shield
and
increased
attack
damage
of
Eye
Of
The
Storm
can
allow
allies
to
favourably
harass
and
trade
with
enemies.
Eye
Of
The
Storm
grants
increased
attack
damage
,
so
use
it
on
an
ally
(or
yourself)
when
attacking
an
enemy
turrets
or
in
team
fights.
To
maximize
the
potential
of
the
shield's
attack
damage
bonus,
Eye
of
the
Storm
is
best
used
on
a
friendly
DPS
champion
during
a
team
fight.
Take
into
consideration
the
current
attack
speed
and
attack
damage
scaling
of
your
potential
allied
targets.
Eye
Of
The
Storm
(at
level
5)
is
approximately
equivalent
to
a
free
B.
F.
Sword
.
You
must
judge
when
it
is
appropriate
to
use
Monsoon
,
especially
in
team
fights.
There
are
multiple
functions
for
this
ultimate:
To
disrupt
enemy
champions'
channels.
To
heal
the
team
for
an
extended
push.
To
push
enemy
champions
towards
your
team's
champions
or
turrets
.
To
push
enemy
champions
away
from
your
allies,
minions
or
buildings.
To
protect
your
team
from
delayed
damage
from
other
abilities
such
as
Karthus's
Requiem
,
Zilean's
Time
Bomb
and
damage
over
time
abilities
by
offsetting
the
expected
damage.
To
isolate
enemy
champions
from
their
team
mates.
To
save
one
or
more
of
your
teammates
from
a
bad
situation.
Flash
can
work
well
with
Monsoon
by
flashing
into
their
team
and
separating
them
with
Monsoon
.
Monsoon
is
one
of
the
best
counters
to
a
team
with
multiple
AoE
ultimates/abilities
as
it
will
knock
enemies
back,
preventing
initiation,
canceling
channeled
spells,
and
healing
your
team.
Janna's
abilities
allow
her
to
have
a
natural
movement
speed
bonus
that
should
be
used
to
her
advantage.
A
quick
combination
of
Howling
Gale
and
Monsoon
is
a
very
good
way
of
saving
your
team
in
a
losing
fight.
Discharge
a
tornado
ahead
of
you
when
fleeing
an
enemy,
make
sure
they
follow
you
in
its'
path
and
release
in
a
timely
manner
to
stall
them.
Build
usage
Janna
is
built
to
be
a
highly
utilitarian
support,
but
her
high
scaling
of
ability
power
allows
her
to
function
as
a
CC-oriented
mage
also.
Her
prime
statistics
are
ability
power
and
cooldown
reduction.
Support
Janna
As
un
AP
support
Janna
enjoys
gigantical
ability
power
ratios
,
notably
on
Monsoon
's
heal.
Unlike
other
AP
supports,
like
Lulu
or
Nami
Janna
's
attack
range
is
very
short,
making
the
AP
support
core
item
Spellthief's
Edge
not
very
useful
against
ranged
opponents.
As
a
normaly
passive
and
defensive
support
Ancient
Coin
is
more
fitting
for
her
Janna
is
very
mana
hungry,
as
such
an
early
Chalice
of
Harmony
will
largely
mitigate
this
problem.
You
can
upgrade
it
right
away
into
Athene's
Unholy
Grail
,
but
you
will
need
ward
coverage
so
rushing
a
Sightstone
into
a
Ruby
Sightstone
is
recommended.
The
health
given
by
it
helps
a
lot
with
the
now-popular
kill
bot
lanes.
On
any
case
eventually
getting
your
Athene's
Unholy
Grail
is
highly
recommended
Along
with
that
Athene's
Unholy
Grail
,
Ionian
Boots
of
Lucidity
and
CDR
masteries
you
will
hit
40%
that
is
very
important
for
Janna.
From
that
on
feel
free
to
grab
AP
or
pure
support
items.
AP
will
transform
into
powerful
utility
and
amage
while
support
items
will
plain
out
give
the
utility
to
her.
At
about
350
AP
Monsoon
's
heal
is
so
powerful
that
it
can
make
Janna's
team
almost
invulnerable
to
non-burst
damage
for
it's
duration
Eye
Of
The
Storm
scales
extremely
hard
with
AP
and
quickly
turns
into
a
huge
health
barrier,
and
-ironicaly-
getting
even
larger
that
the
summoner
spell
barrier
,
as
well
on
a
6
second
cooldown.
This
ability
is
not
very
useful
late
game
without
AP
Zephyr
damage
scales
only
moderatly
but
the
slow
gets
very
harsh
with
AP
Howling
Gale
while
is
Janna's
main
damage
ability
is
also
the
one
that
scales
the
worst
with
AP.
The
ratio
is
medriocre
if
fired
right
away
and
decent
at
best
if
fully
charged
If
you
choose
the
AP
path
recommended
items
are:
Rabadon's
Deathcap
,
Spooky
Ghosts
,
Zhonya's
Hourglass
.
You
can
also
drop
your
boots
as
Zephyr
movement
speed
boost
with
high
AP
largely
beats
the
movement
given
by
any
boot.
A
good
replacement
for
that
lost
CDR
is
Banner
of
Command
that
also
packs
a
beafy
amount
of
AP.
In
a
more
supportive
build
items
like
Mikael's
Crucible
,
Zeke's
Herald
and
Locket
of
the
Iron
Solari
are
useful.
You
should
bear
in
mind
that
Janna's
scaling
with
AP
alredy
boosts
her
utility
a
lot
-not
to
mention
her
damage-
so
building
this
items
is
a
questionable
desicion.
AP
Janna
Lich
Bane
is
a
core
item
on
AP
Janna,
as
it
allows
for
more
sustained
damage
with
only
two
damage
spells.
To
maximize
AP
Janna's
effeciency,
spread
out
her
skills
so
that
each
one
procs
Lich
Bane.
Building
Deathfire
Grasp
on
AP
Janna
is
also
required
as
her
burst
is
not
that
strong,
and
the
secondary
effect
improves
the
rest
of
her
otherwise
mediocre
damage.
A
Catalyst
the
Protector
increases
Janna's
survivability,
and
can
be
built
into
a
Rod
of
Ages
.
It
grants
a
good
amount
of
sustain
and
is
a
good
way
to
get
HP.
Building
Mejai's
Soulstealer
works
well
with
Janna
as
her
skill
set
is
great
for
escaping
and
kiting.
Having
THE
largest
mana
pool
in
the
game,
building
Archangel's
Staff
is
a
good
idea.
However
bear
in
mind
that
Janna
has
a
hard
time
charging
it
up.
Only
pick
it
up
if
you
are
sure
the
game
will
last
for
long.
It
bears
great
results
but
takes
time

Countering
Although
Janna
is
mainly
played
as
a
support,
her
damage
output
is
still
significant
due
to
high
AP
ratios
from
Howling
Gale
and
Zephyr
.
Do
not
neglect
magic
resistance.
Howling
Gale
damage
output
is
moderate,
but
it
needs
a
few
seconds
before
it
can
deal
full
damage.
Quickly
avoid
the
spell's
path
to
avoid
the
damage.
Have
your
team
stagger
to
avoid
the
knock-up,
which
can
be
used
easily
almost
instantly.
By
late
game
Eye
Of
The
Storm
becomes
a
huge
bulwark
of
health.
Be
careful
of
getting
batited
into
killedg
one
of
her
low
health
allies
and
suddendly
she
gives
them
500
bonus
health.
Do
not
underestimate
Janna's
mobility,
as
her
Zephyr
increases
her
movement
speed
passively
and
allows
her
to
move
through
minions.
Using
Zephyr
as
a
slow
removes
her
movement
speed
bonus
while
it
is
on
cooldown.
Baiting
her
to
use
the
slow
and
then
attacking
her
with
a
gap-closer
can
render
her
more
vulnerable.
However,
this
will
only
really
work
if
Howling
Gale
and
Monsoon
are
already
on
cooldown
since
she
may
use
those
in
response
and
as
a
melee
champion,
if
your
team
can
slow
her
as
well
since
the
duration
of
Zephyr
's
slow
is
significant
enough
to
likely
stop
as
few
autoattacks
for
melee
champions
trying
to
chase
her
without
Janna
being
slowed
herself.
When
you
see
Janna
channeling
her
Monsoon
,
quickly
disable
her
to
prevent
her
from
healing
her
teammates.
If
your
team
cannot
easily
stop
it,
retreat.
The
healing
from
Monsoon
is
so
gigantical
that
gives
her
team
near
invulneravility
while
it
lasts-
it
is
best
to
cut
your
losses,
and
try
to
re-engage
again
later
before
Monsoon
goes
off
its
significant
cooldown.
During
early
game,
try
to
force
her
to
shield
early(through
damage,
movement
feints,
etc).
Then
wait
for
it
to
wear
off,
so
you
can
use
your
higher
damage
spells
on
her.
This
can
severely
cripple
her
presence
in
lane
or
force
her
to
go
back,
potentially
leaving
her
ADC
defenseless
or
turning
her
into
an
easy
kill.
