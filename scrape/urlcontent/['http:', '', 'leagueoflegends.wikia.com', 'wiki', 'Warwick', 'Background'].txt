Champion
Warwick
was
once
a
man
revered
for
his
ability
to
track
down
human
specimens
for
the
darkest
types
of
scientific
research.
When
his
ambitions
exceeded
his
physical
limits,
he
drank
a
dangerous
elixir
to
transform
himself
into
an
unstoppable
manhunter.
His
newfound
strength
bore
a
heavy
price.
Before
his
transformation,
Warwick
found
his
calling
in
Zaun
as
a
"procurer"
of
human
test
subjects.
Known
for
his
crafty
methods
and
ruthless
determination,
people
regarded
him
with
a
cautious
mixture
of
fear
and
respect.
As
his
reputation
grew,
so
did
the
demands
placed
upon
him.
His
clients
wanted
more
rare
and
dangerous
specimens,
and
they
wanted
them
sooner.
To
meet
their
demands,
Warwick
needed
the
strength
that
transcended
his
limited
human
form.
His
longtime
friend,
Singed
,
devised
a
powerful
formula.
The
recipe
called
for
three
critical
components:
silver
from
the
Shadow
Isles
,
the
fang
of
a
Balefire
dire
wolf,
and
the
heart
of
a
celestial
being.
Warwick
tracked
down
the
first
two
in
short
order,
but
the
third
proved
a
much
greater
challenge.
He
traveled
to
Ionia
to
trap
Soraka
,
a
creature
believed
to
be
a
child
of
the
stars,
but
she
discovered
his
ploy
and
drove
him
away
with
powerful
magic.
Unable
to
tolerate
his
failure,
Warwick
returned
to
Singed
disfigured
and
furious.
He
demanded
the
chemist's
incomplete
potion,
but
Singed
warned
him
that
the
results
would
be
unpredictable.
Ignoring
his
friend's
warning,
Warwick
drank
the
concoction.
The
brew
transformed
him
into
a
creature
both
man
and
wolf,
infusing
him
with
raw
strength
and
heightened
senses.
Exhilarated,
he
immediately
began
testing
his
newfound
power.
Each
day
his
instincts
became
sharper,
but
his
human
half
slipped
further
away.
He
could
feel
himself
losing
control:
though
he
always
got
his
prey,
he
often
failed
to
bring
them
back
alive.
Now
he
seeks
the
blood
of
Soraka
to
stabilize
his
transformation
before
his
mind
gives
way
to
the
feral
urges
of
the
beast.
"Eventually
the
beast
catches
up
with
all
of
us."
―
Warwick
Warwick's
lore
was
officially
updated
on
September
18
th
,
2012.
[1]
Warwick
counted
himself
amongst
the
most
powerful
and
revered
men
in
his
home
city-state
of
Zaun
.
Over
the
course
of
his
infamous
career
as
an
alchemist,
Warwick
won
many
honors
for
his
craft,
not
the
least
of
which
was
a
lucrative
offer
for
service
in
the
Noxian
military
during
their
campaigns
against
Ionia
.
Sequestered
in
his
labs
far
from
the
front
lines,
Warwick
and
his
apprentice
Singed
toiled
relentlessly
to
manufacture
all
manner
of
appalling
concoctions
for
the
Noxian
army.
So
potent
was
his
art
that
even
the
greatest
of
Ionia's
healers
-
under
the
leadership
of
the
Starchild
Soraka
-
struggled
to
combat
the
poisons
and
chemical
weapons
generated
by
his
despicable
mind.
Warwick's
reign
of
terror
grew
so
horrific
that
his
very
name
became
a
curse
in
the
eyes
of
his
Ionian
foes,
and
they
began
referring
to
him
only
as
"the
Deathmaker".
But
even
one
under
the
protection
of
the
Noxian
High
Command
is
not
wholly
beyond
the
reach
of
retribution.
For
as
Soraka
strode
across
the
myriad
of
death
and
destruction
left
in
the
wake
of
one
of
Warwick's
chemical
attacks,
her
heart
finally
gave
way.
She
called
down
the
wrath
of
the
cosmos
on
Warwick,
wishing
that
his
form
should
mirror
the
cruelty
in
his
heart
-
a
curse
that
would
come
at
the
price
of
her
aspiring
divinity.
Within
his
laboratory,
a
terrible
thirst
took
hold
over
Warwick.
As
his
apprentice
looked
on
in
horror,
Warwick
threw
open
the
doors
to
his
bastion
and
sprinted
off
towards
parts
unknown,
a
bloodcurdling
howling
marking
his
passage.
He
had
become
a
werewolf;
a
wild,
murderous
beast.
Today,
the
Blood
Hunter
fights
for
Noxus
within
the
League
of
Legends
...
thankful
of
the
curse
that
his
now-mortal
enemy
bestowed
upon
him.
"The
rage
of
the
beast
now
complements
his
predatory
spirit."
―
Singed,
the
Mad
Chemist
,
upon
witnessing
his
master's
transformation
