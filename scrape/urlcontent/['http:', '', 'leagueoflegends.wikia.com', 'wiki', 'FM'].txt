Notes
Champions
that
prefer
to
auto
attack
a
lot
but
lack
sufficient
built-in
CC,
like
Fiora
and
Shyvana
,
benefit
the
most
from
this
item,
allowing
them
to
stick
to
opponents
and
applying
the
slow
often.
The
slow
from
Frozen
Mallet
will
not
stack
with
Iceborn
Gauntlet
or
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
.
Only
the
largest
slow
from
an
item
is
applied
so
having
multiple
slow
effect
items
(such
as
Rylai's)
will
not
increase
your
ability
to
slow.
It
will
stack
with
ability
slows,
Randuin's
Omen
and
Blessing
of
the
Lizard
Elder
,
though
with
diminishing
returns.
Trivia
A
build
consisting
of
Frozen
Mallet
and
Atma's
Impaler
is
referred
to
as
"Fratma's."
Combining
it
with
a
Warmog's
Armor
is
called
"Fratmogs"
among
other
possible
names.
