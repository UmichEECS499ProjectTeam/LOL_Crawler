Trivia
Soraka
is
voiced
by
Lisa
Lindsley
,
who
also
voices
Kayle
.
Soraka's
Starcall
ability
can
provide
the
most
magic
resistance
reduction
in
the
game.
A
full
10
stacks
provides
over
120
magic
resistance
reduction
with
high
AP.
Soraka's
name
is
derived
from
the
Japanese
word
"sora,"
which
means
"sky,"
a
reference
to
Soraka's
celestial
nature.
Soraka
was
one
of
the
champions
available
in
the
Ionian
pool
during
the
Ionia
vs.
Noxus
match
.
She
was
one
of
the
selected
champions.
Soraka
was
in
the
previous
Ionian
versus
Noxus
match
and
had
apparently
performed
quite
poorly.
In
the
Mac
launch
video,
there
is
a
banana
in
the
weapons
cabinet.
This
is
a
homage
to
Soraka's
autoattack
particle,
whose
look
has
often
been
compared
to
a
banana.
Quotes
Soraka's
new
joke,
"Yes,
that
was
a
banana.
*giggles*
No-one
expects
the
banana!"
is
a
reference
to
the
community
nickname
for
her
conspicuous
autoattack
projectile.
The
second
part
of
the
joke
may
also
be
a
reference
to
the
Monty
Python
sketch
The
Spanish
Inquisition
notable
for
the
catchphrase
"Nobody
expects
the
Spanish
Inquisition".
This
could
also
be
a
reference
to
the
'banana
kill'
meme
that
is
used
in
tournaments
and
other
live
events,
where
an
"unexpected"
last
autoattack
by
Soraka
kills
off
an
enemy
and
the
crowd
goes
wild
about
and/or
the
commentators
commentate
on
how
the
last
banana
got
the
kill.
Soraka
shares
a
quote
with
Lee
Sin
,
"
Where
am
I
needed?"
Skins
Old
Soraka's
Classic
skin
changed
color
depending
which
team
she
was
on.
Her
jacket
was
either
pink
or
yellow.
Dryad
Soraka
is
based
off
of
the
dryad,
a
nymph
of
the
trees
(specifically
oak
trees)
from
Greek
mythology.
Divine
Soraka
is
intended
to
show
her
appearance
before
she
fell
from
grace
by
using
her
powers
offensively.
The
Chinese
version
of
Soraka's
Classic
skin
is
the
background
image
of
the
"
Utility
"
section
in
the
mastery
pages.
Soraka
had
an
unreleased
skin
under
the
name
"Battle
Priestess
Soraka"
.
[1]
It
was
remade
into
"Celestine
Soraka".
​
Celestine
Soraka
bears
some
resemblance
to
the
priests
of
the
Protectorate
of
Menoth
from
the
Miniatures
Game
"WarMachine".
Relations
Soraka
was
deceived
by
Warwick
in
his
attempt
to
rip
her
heart
out.
Soraka
was
responsible
for
reviving
a
nearly
deceased
Irelia
during
the
Noxian
invasion
of
Ionia.
She
did
so
by
binding
her
life
force
to
her
hiten
blades.
