Notes
The
passive
can
be
a
very
effective
counter
to
champions
with
healing
abilities,
such
as
Fiddlesticks's
Drain
,
Soraka's
Astral
Blessing
,
Sion's
Cannibalism
,
Aatrox's
Blood
Thirst
and
especially
Dr.Mundo's
Sadism
;
or
against
any
champions
that
build
life
steal
or
spell
vamp
.
The
passive
does
not
deal
any
damage
itself,
unlike
Ignite
or
Tristana's
Explosive
Shot
,
and
as
such,
will
not
delay
stealth
or
passives
such
as
Malphite's
Granite
Shield
or
Garen's
Perseverance
.
The
passive
also
will
not
affect
additional
health
from
abilities
or
shields,
such
as
Lulu's
Wild
Growth
or
Morgana's
Black
Shield
.
Trivia
Shortly
after
its
update
in
V1.0.0.61
the
item
had
to
be
hotfixed
as
it
was
dealing
extremely
high
damage-over-time
based
on
ability
power
instead
of
the
intended
4
damage-per-second.

The
History
of
the
Executioner’s
Calling
Reira
Kashuld
commenting
from
the
Institute
of
War
I
love
artifacts
and
armaments.
I
really,
really
do.
In
my
hometown
of
the
Kashuld
Province
in
Ionia
,
there
is
no
greater
pride
than
our
knowledge,
love,
and
craft
for
artifacts.
From
the
most
basic
Cloth
Armor
to
the
most
intricate
of
Negatron-Alloy
woven
cloaks
,
the
specs
and
methods
of
craft
really
set
my
heart
aflutter.
This
is
especially
the
case
when
considering
a
blade
with
as
rich
a
history
as
the
Executioner’s
Calling
Long
Sword
.
More
often
than
not
new
weaponry
is
born
out
of
necessity.
Ridley
and
Hollow
Armaments
(R.H.
Armaments),
a
weapons
contractor
based
in
the
city-state
of
Noxus
,
has
always
remained
a
very
stable
business.
This
is
mostly
due
to
the
good
relationship
they
have
with
the
city-state
itself,
whose
contracts
makes
up
more
than
70%
of
the
company’s
revenue.
Fifteen
years
ago
during
the
Noxian
invasion
of
Ionia,
the
standard
issue
weapon
for
the
frontline
troops
was
the
Conquest
I
Long
Sword
(the
grandfather
of
the
R.H.
Armaments
Long
Sword
that
is
used
in
the
League
today).
Its
popularity
is
owed
to
its
rugged
durability,
ease
of
use,
and
low
production
cost
for
an
iron
weapon.
The
Conquest
I
Long
Sword
was
so
popular
in
its
day
that
you
could
find
one
in
nearly
every
Noxian
household!
During
the
war,
the
Noxian
forces
encountered
many
problems
when
facing
Ionian
military
units.
This
was
in
part
because
Ionian
squads
always
contained
at
least
one
medical
officer
which
gave
Ionians
an
advantage
in
small
skirmish
situations.
To
match
this,
R.H.
Armaments
developed
the
Executioner’s
Calling
Long
Sword
(ECLS1).
The
ECLS1
was
not
made
entirely
out
of
plain
iron
like
the
original
Conquest
I,
but
instead
was
forged
of
82%
iron
and
18%
Scarlet
steel,
which
helped
fuel
the
relentless
attacks
of
the
Noxian
army.
The
blade
itself
was
thinner
and
sturdier,
allowing
the
wielder
to
precisely
target
the
enemy’s
vital
points,
this
however
came
at
the
cost
of
overall
heft
and
raw
power.
The
most
interesting
modification
to
the
ECLS1
was
a
barbed
hook
at
the
very
tip
of
the
blade,
which
was
used
for
tearing
into
enemies
on
each
attack.
This
inflicted
a
very
severe
wound
that
was
difficult
for
healers
to
mend,
and
caused
progressive
tissue
damage
well
after
the
initial
injury.
In
response
to
this,
the
Ionian
military
changed
their
tactics
and
began
to
utilize
more
ranged,
hit-and-run
strategies
to
keep
the
Noxians
at
bay.
This
was
when
R.H.
Armaments
countered
with
the
ECLS2
–
a
modified
version
of
the
ECLS1
with
an
eject-able
barb
at
the
end
of
the
blade.
With
a
simple
flick
of
the
wrist,
experienced
users
can
fire
the
barb
at
enemy
targets
from
a
distance.
This
“feature”
was
met
with
some
contention,
however,
due
to
it
requiring
much
more
training
to
use
effectively
than
the
ECLS1.
The
Arcanum
Majoris
approved
the
original
ECLS1
for
use
in
League
matches,
but
they
upgraded
to
the
ECLS2
on
February
24,
20
CLE
last
year.
Currently
the
League
uses
the
ECLS2-L
(League)
model,
which
was
specifically
commissioned
by
the
Arcanum
Majoris.
The
ECLS2-L
features
a
slightly
higher
amount
of
scarlet
steel,
at
the
cost
of
a
bit
more
weight.
The
result
provides
much
more
life-essence
siphoning
than
the
original.
The
weapon
itself
is
a
joy
to
use.
It
has
perfect
50-50
weight
balance
which
is
barely
thrown
off
by
ejecting
the
barb.
The
almost
rapier-like
shape
of
the
blade
offers
unparalleled
precision
versus
any
other
blade
in
its
class.
My
only
complaint
is
that
the
stock
handle
is
shoddily
molded
and
slippery.
The
Executioner’s
Calling
Long
Sword
was
a
tide-turning
weapon
developed
in
a
time
of
need.
Although
its
ease-of-use
is
often
put
in
question,
it
can
be
devastating
in
the
hands
of
a
skilled
wielder.
It
works
well
in
a
situation
where
more
“permanent”
damage
is
necessary
and
will
get
the
job
done
when
used
correctly.
R.H.
Armaments
has
not
released
any
information
on
a
third
model
yet,
but
I
will
be
the
first
to
bring
you
that
information
if
and
when
it
comes!"
