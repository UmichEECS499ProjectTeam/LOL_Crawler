Strategy
Solo
melee
champions
sometimes
start
the
game
with
Cloth
Armor
to
improve
lane
sustainability.
The
other
common
defensive
start
for
such
champions
is
Doran's
Shield
.
The
choice
between
the
two
comes
down
to
whether
one
prefers
the
80
flat
health
,
6
health
regeneration
,
and
8
less
damage
from
champion
autoattacks
that
Doran's
Shield
offers,
or
the
15
armor
and
175
left
over
gold
that
Cloth
Armor
provides,
which
can
be
used
to
purchase
wards
and
potions
.
