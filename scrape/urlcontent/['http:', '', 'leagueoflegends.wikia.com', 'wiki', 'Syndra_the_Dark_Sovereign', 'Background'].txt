Born
with
immense
magical
potential,
Syndra
loves
nothing
more
than
exercising
the
incredible
power
at
her
command.
With
each
passing
day,
her
mastery
of
magical
force
grows
more
potent
and
devastating.
Refusing
any
notion
of
balance
or
restraint,
Syndra
wants
only
to
retain
control
of
her
power,
even
if
it
means
annihilating
the
authorities
that
seek
to
stop
her.
Throughout
her
youth
in
Ionia
,
Syndra's
reckless
use
of
magic
terrified
the
elders
of
her
village.
They
took
her
to
a
remote
temple,
leaving
her
in
the
care
of
an
old
mage.
To
Syndra's
delight,
the
mage
explained
that
the
temple
was
a
school
--
a
place
where
she
could
develop
her
talents
under
his
guidance.
Though
she
learned
much
during
her
time
there,
Syndra
no
longer
felt
her
power
growing
as
it
had
in
her
youth.
Her
frustration
grew,
and
she
finally
confronted
her
mentor,
demanding
an
explanation.
He
revealed
that
he
had
dampened
Syndra's
magic,
hoping
to
help
her
learn
control
and
restraint.
Accusing
him
of
betrayal,
she
advanced
on
the
mage,
commanding
him
to
lift
the
spell
that
was
holding
her
back.
He
backed
away,
telling
her
that
if
she
couldn't
control
herself,
he
would
be
forced
to
nullify
Syndra's
magic
completely.
Furious,
she
summoned
her
power
and
dashed
the
old
man
against
the
walls.
With
her
mentor
dead,
Syndra
felt
the
rush
of
her
unbounded
potential
for
the
first
time
in
years.
Though
she
had
won
her
freedom,
she
refused
to
return
to
the
society
that
had
tried
to
steal
her
gift.
Instead,
Syndra
decided
to
claim
her
former
prison
as
a
stronghold.
Pushing
the
boundaries
of
her
magic,
she
tore
the
structure
from
its
foundations
and
raised
it
into
the
sky.
Free
to
delve
further
into
her
art,
Syndra
now
aims
to
grow
powerful
enough
to
destroy
the
weak,
foolish
leaders
of
Ionia
--
and
anyone
else
who
would
dare
shackle
her
greatness.
"Power
belongs
to
those
who
can
wield
it."

In
addition
to
Rengar,
we'll
have
another
upcoming
champion
available
for
play
at
Gamescom
in
Cologne,
Germany.
After
the
Pridestalker
joins
the
League,
Syndra,
the
Dark
Sovereign,
will
descend
upon
the
Fields
of
Justice
in
the
following
patch.
A
magical
prodigy,
Syndra
conjures
powerful
dark
spheres,
and
even
wields
enemy
minions
and
monsters
as
weapons.
Here's
the
full
rundown
of
her
abilities:
Transcendent
(Passive):
Each
of
Syndra's
normal
abilities
gain
an
extra
effect
at
max
rank.
Dark
Sphere:
Spheres
deal
bonus
damage
to
champions.
Force
of
Will:
Projectiles
briefly
knock
enemies
into
the
air.
Scatter
the
Weak:
Cone
width
increases.
Dark
Sphere:
Syndra
conjures
a
dark
sphere
at
a
target
location,
dealing
magic
damage
in
an
area.
The
sphere
remains
for
several
seconds
and
can
be
manipulated
by
Syndra's
other
abilities.
Force
of
Will:
First
Cast:
Grabs
a
target
dark
sphere,
enemy
minion
or
neutral
monster.
Second
Cast:
Throw
a
grasped
dark
sphere
or
enemy
at
a
target
area.
Enemies
struck
by
the
projectile
take
magic
damage
and
are
slowed.
Scatter
the
Weak:
Deals
magic
damage
in
a
cone
and
knocks
enemies
away
based
on
how
close
they
are
to
Syndra.
Dark
spheres
within
the
area
of
effect
are
also
knocked
back,
dealing
magic
damage
and
stunning
enemies
in
their
path.
Unleashed
Power
(Ultimate):
Draws
upon
Syndra's
full
cataclysmic
power,
harnessing
all
active
dark
spheres
to
deal
additional
magic
damage
to
an
enemy
champion.
Syndra's
kit
revolves
around
the
manipulation
of
short-duration
globes
left
behind
by
Dark
Sphere.
While
the
function
of
Dark
Sphere
is
very
simple
on
the
surface,
proper
sphere
management
can
be
the
difference
between
success
and
failure
with
Syndra.
Each
of
her
abilities
can
be
used
on
its
own
in
a
pinch,
but
good
sphere
placement
ensures
that
Syndra
always
has
the
ammunition
she
needs
to
throw
projectiles
with
Force
of
Will,
and
creates
new
firing
angles
for
globes
launched
with
Scatter
the
Weak.
While
it
might
be
tempting
to
snatch
up
a
defenseless
minion
and
use
it
as
a
projectile,
Syndra's
Force
of
Will
ability
really
shins
when
it's
used
in
conjunction
with
dark
spheres.
Syndra
can
use
Force
of
Will
to
reposition
these
globes
for
a
successful
shot
with
Scatter
the
Weak
while
Dark
Sphere
is
on
cooldown,
or
to
extend
the
duration
of
a
sphere
that's
about
to
expire
in
order
to
build
up
ammunition
on
the
battlefield.
Ultimately,
keeping
your
sphere
count
high
in
this
manner
will
allow
you
to
dictate
the
course
of
a
battle
by
threatening
a
large
area.
The
importance
of
managing
your
dark
spheres
is
most
keenly
illustrated
by
Syndra's
ultimate
ability,
Unleashed
Power.
The
increased
damage
granted
by
each
active
sphere
can
transform
this
ability
from
high-damage
nuke
into
a
cataclysmic
attack.
Good
planning
and
strategic
dark
sphere
placement
can
make
Syndra
an
intimidating
opponent
to
face
in
mid
lane.
*
Syndra's
ability
to
clear
minion
waves
from
long
range
and
put
out
a
ton
of
burst
damage
got
to
be
a
bit
much
when
combined
with
her
substantial
complement
of
crowd
control
abilities.
Ultimately,
we
decided
that
the
slow
from
Force
of
Will
combined
with
the
stun
and
knockback
of
Scatter
the
Weak
gave
her
a
problematic
amount
of
disruption
potential
for
the
amount
of
damage
she
was
doing.
To
solve
this,
we
lowered
the
base
slow
on
Force
of
Will
and
tweaked
the
added
effect
from
her
passive.
Instead
of
knocking
opponents
into
the
air,
you’ll
now
get
an
increase
in
your
slow’s
duration
when
Force
of
Will
reaches
Rank
5.
