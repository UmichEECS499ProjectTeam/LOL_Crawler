Trivia
Nasus
was
designed
by
Ezreal
.
Nasus
before
his
rework
was
voiced
by
Eugene
McDaniels
[1]
,
who
passed
away
in
2011.
Nasus
bears
a
great
resemblance
to
the
Egyptian
god
Anubis
.
Nasus
has
a
brother
named
Renekton
who
may
be
based
on
Sobek
.
Nasus'
scepter
has
a
model
that
is
similar
to
a
Was
,
a
scepter
held
by
Egyptian
gods.
Nasus
is
one
of
a
few
champions
to
have
multiple
textures
in
one
skin.
When
he
uses
Fury
of
the
Sands
,
in
addition
to
growing
in
size,
his
armor
turns
silver
and
his
skin
turns
jet
black.
Nasus'
original
name
during
development
was
"Ammon".
Nasus'
old
dance
was
the
famous
"Walk
like
an
Egyptian".
Nasus
is
one
of
four
champions
that
can
infinitely
increase
their
stats
by
using
their
abilities.
Nasus
can
continuously
stack
up
Siphoning
Strike
's
damage.
The
other
three
who
can
increase
their
stats
indefinitely
are
Sion
with
Enrage
,
Veigar
with
Baleful
Strike
,
and
Thresh
with
Damnation
.
Unlike
the
other
three,
Nasus's
Siphoning
Strike
stacks
do
not
affect
Nasus
in
any
way
aside
from
higher
damage
on
the
ability.
Quotes
Nasus
'
joke
is
a
quote
from
the
famous
song

Let
the
Dogs
Out?"
by

Nasus
'
quote
"Where
angels
fear
to
tread"

Criticism
but

since
its
original
creation.
In
the
Polish
client,
Nasus
'
joke
"Wy
nie
wiecie,
a
ja
wiem,
jak
rozmawiać
trzeba
z
psem",
(You
don't
know,
but
I
do
know
how
to
talk
with
dogs)
is
a
reference

Nasus
'
quote,
"Hope
is
the
opiate
of
the
frail,"

famous
aphorism,
"Religion
is
the
opiate
of
the
masses."
(Or,
in
the
original
German,
"Die
Religion
ist
das
Opium
des
Volkes.")
