Ability
Details
Spray
and
Pray
is
a
self-buff
ability
that
also
causes
Twitch's
basic
attacks
to
be
replaced
by
pass-through
linear
skill
shots
.
Does
not
apply
spell
effects
.
The
enhanced
autoattacks
will
apply
on-hit
effects
to
all
targets
hit.
Critical
strikes
are
applied
per
attack
-
if
it
crits
on
one
target,
it
will
crit
on
all
of
them.
The
enhanced
autoattacks
will
trigger
life
steal
on
all
targets
hit
for
full
effect.
Enhanced
autoattacks
can
be
dodged
,
parried
and
blocked
,
and
will
miss
if
Twitch
is
blinded
.
Spell
shields
will
not
block
the
enhanced
autoattacks.
Additional
Information:
Spray
and
Pray
has
no
cast
time
and
does
not
interrupt
Twitch's
previous
orders.
Twitch's
attacks
during
Spray
and
Pray
can
outrange
turrets
(850
range
opposed
to
the
turrets'
800)
meaning
he
can
damage
them
during
Spray
and
Pray
without
taking
damage
from
them.
Twitch's
attacks
will
pass
through
structures
and
terrain,
but
will
not
damage
structures
unless
they
were
directly
targeted
for
the
attack.
The
exception
is
the
Nexus
-
Twitch's
attacks
will
not
deal
any
damage
to
it.
This
is
likely
a
bug.
For
purposes
of
Runaan's
Hurricane
,
attacking
with
Spray
and
Pray
counts
as
a
single
auto-attack
against
a
single
targeted
enemy,
and
as
such
will
only
launch
one
pair
of
ordinary
single-target
bolts
to
nearby
enemies.
Twitch
will
gain
a
stack
of
Spell
Weaving
for
each
enemy
hit.
He
will
also
gain
a
stack
of
Frenzy
for
each
enemy
hit
with
a
critical
strike
.
