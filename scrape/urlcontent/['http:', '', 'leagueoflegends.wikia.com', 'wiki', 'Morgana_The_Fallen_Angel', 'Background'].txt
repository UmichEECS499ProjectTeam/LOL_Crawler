There
is
a
world
far
away
populated
by
graceful
and
beautiful
winged
beings
gifted
with
immortality,
where
an
ancient
conflict
still
rages.
Like
so
many
conflicts,
this
war
split
families.
One
side
proclaimed
themselves
as
beings
of
perfect
order
and
justice,
fighting
to
unite
the
world
under
their
law
and
strong
central
governance.
Those
that
fought
against
them
saw
their
kin
as
tyrants,
creatures
incapable
of
seeing
the
larger
view,
who
would
sacrifice
individuality
and
freedom
for
the
illusion
of
efficiency
and
safety.
Morgana
was
one
who
fought
against
what
she
perceived
as
the
tyranny
of
her
kind,
and
for
that
she
was
branded
"fallen".
Morgana
was
not
innocent,
having
plumbed
forgotten
ways
to
gather
forbidden
might
to
become
a
powerful
mistress
of
the
black
arts.
This
goal
was
driven
by
her
obsession
to
defeat
the
general
of
the
opposition's
army
-
her
sister,
Kayle
.
While
the
two
were
in
fact
birth-sisters,
Kayle
struck
the
first
blow
by
disowning
any
filial
connection
when
Morgana
refused
to
join
her
cause.
Eventually,
Morgana
grew
in
power
enough
to
not
only
reach,
but
challenge
Kayle.
As
the
time
approached
when
the
two
would
meet
in
what
could
be
their
final
conflict,
Morgana
was
suddenly
summoned
to
Valoran
.
At
first,
Morgana
made
a
deal
with
the
League's
summoners
to
fight
in
exchange
for
greater
power.
With
the
advent
of
Kayle
into
the
League,
Morgana
now
willingly
fights
in
the
League
of
Legends
for
the
privilege
of
being
able
to
destroy
her
sister
again,
and
again,
and
again.
She
lies
in
wait
for
the
day
the
bonds
of
the
Institute
of
War
no
longer
hold
her,
and
on
that
day
she
plans
to
destroy
Kayle
once
and
for
all
and
return
home
a
hero.
"There
is
no
rest
while
Kayle's
brand
of
tyranny
still
exists."

There
is
a

where
an
ancient
conflict
still
rages.
Like
so
many
wars,
this
war
split

One
side
called
themselves
angels,
claiming
to
be
beings
of
perfect
order
and
justice.
Those
that
fought
against
them
believed
the
angels
to
be
tyrants,
creatures
incapable
of
seeing

Morgana
was
one
who
fought
against
what
she
perceived
as
the
tyranny
of
the
angels,
and
for
that
she
was
branded
fallen
.
Morgana
was
not
innocent,
having
taken
to
the
practice
of
the
black
arts
in
an
effort
to
fight
against
the
general
of
her
enemy's
army
-
her
sister,
Kayle
,
who
had
long
ago
disavowed
any
filial
connection.
Then,
as
the
two
were
locked
in
what
might
be
their
final
conflict,
they
were
suddenly
summoned
to
Valoran
.
Morgana
now
fights
in
the
League
of
Legends
,
but
only
with
the
goal
of
destroying
her
sister
before
returning
home.
"
While
some
call
Morgana
'fallen',
she
enjoys
more
clearly
defining
this
status
to
her
enemies.
