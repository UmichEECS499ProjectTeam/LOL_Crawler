Ebonmaw,
the
Terror
of
Zaun
was
the
previous
epic
monster
on
Twisted
Treeline
in
League
of
Legends
and
has
been
replaced
by
Vilemaw
as
of
V1.0.0.150
.
Once
defeated,
Ebonmaw
will
grant
to
all
living
members
of
the
killing
team
the
Crest
of
Crushing
Wrath
buff,
which
increases
damage
dealt
by
champions'
attacks
and
spells
by
1%
per
champion
level.
Killing
Ebonmaw
also
grants
280
gold
to
every
member
of
the
team.
It
is
often
called
"dragon,"
as
it
is
the
only
dragon-like
monster
on
the
map;
however,
it
should
not
be
confused
with
the
Dragon
,
which
is
a
monster
only
available
on
Summoner's
Rift
.
Ebonmaw
camp
location
in
Twisted
Treeline.
Strategy
Ebonmaw
is
an
epic
monster
and
should
be
approached
with
care
when
attempting
to
kill
him.
Because
of
the
Global
Gold
and
damage
increasing
buff,
keeping
Ebonmaw
under
your
control
through
warding
and
killing
it
when
it
spawns
is
essential
to
winning
games.
Trivia
When
one
spectates
a
match
in
Twisted
Treeline,
and
Ebonmaw,
the
Terror
of
Zaun
is
slain,
the
sound
from
slaying
the
dragon
on
Summoners
Rift
plays.
Ebonmaw's
skeleton
can
be
seen
behind
Vilemaw
,
inside
his
lair,
but
Kitae
says
that
this
is
a
tribute
and
not
canon.
