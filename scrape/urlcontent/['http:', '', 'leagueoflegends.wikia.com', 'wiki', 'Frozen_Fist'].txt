Notes
The
item
was
originally
called
"Frozen
Fist",
and
is
still
often
referred
to
as
such.
Some
players
also
refer
to
the
item
as
"Icefist"
or
"Iceborn".
The
area
damage
inflicted
by
the
Gauntlet
is
only
the
125%
of
the
champions
base
Attack
Damage
coming
from
the
item.
The
splash
does
not
include
the
damage
from
the
actual
attack
itself,
or
any
other
sources
of
damage
on
the
hit
such
as
Nasus's
Siphoning
Strike
or
Gangplank's
Parrrley
.
The
main-target,
non-splash
125%
base
attack
damage
bonus
procs
off
lifesteal.
The
effect
will
trigger
against
towers.
The
area
damage
and
slow
still
apply
around
the
tower
as
normal.
As
such,
it
might
trigger
turret
aggro
if
any
enemy
is
nearby
the
turret.
The
slow
proc
does
not
stack
with
Icy
slows
from
Frozen
Mallet
.
Iceborn
Gauntlet
will
stack
multiplicatively
with
other
active
slows
such
as
Twin
Shadow
and
Bilgewater
Cutlass
which
all
stack
with
each
other,
still
limited
by
the
ordinary
slow
diminishing
return
rules,
because
these
active
slows
are
categorized
as
champion
active
abilities.
The
Iceborn
Gauntlet
refers
to
the
Freljordians
who
were
given
power
by
the
Frozen
Watchers.
These
people
were
called
Iceborn.
Their
leader
was
Lissandra
.
