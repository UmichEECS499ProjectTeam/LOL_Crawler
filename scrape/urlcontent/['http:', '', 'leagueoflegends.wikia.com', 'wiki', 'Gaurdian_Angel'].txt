Efficiency
Passive
must
have
at
least
a
value
of
950g
for
Guardian
Angel
to
be
gold
efficient.
Notes
Its
passive
will
always
activate
before
Blood
Well
and
Rebirth
,
but
after
the
Chrono
Shift
buff
if
the
owner
has
it.
If
you
use
Ghost
and
Guardian
Angel
activates,
Ghost
will
still
be
in
effect
after
you
have
been
revived.
Selling
and
repurchasing
the
item
will
not
reset
the
cooldown
on
its
Unique
Passive.
The
passive
does
not
activate
when
killed
by
the
Nexus
Obelisk
.
The
healing
boost
of
Spirit
Visage
(+20%
to
healing)
affects
its
passive,
causing
it
to
restore
36%
health
in
total.
If
its
passive
activates
on
Malzahar
and
his
Voidlings
are
alive,
they'll
keep
moving
and
attacking.
If
Dr.
Mundo
dies
while
under
the
effects
of
Sadism
then
he
will
continue
to
heal
even
as
the
passive
is
activating
