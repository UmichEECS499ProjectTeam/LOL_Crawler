Gold
Efficiency
Talisman
of
Ascension
is
86%
gold
efficient.
For
the
item
to
be
gold
efficient,
its
passive
and
active
effects
must
have
a
value
of
at
least
307g.
Alternatively,
the
item
becomes
gold
efficient
after
being
held
for
25
minutes
and
35
seconds
.
Each
minion
death
reduces
the
timer
by
15
seconds
.
The
item
becomes
194%
gold
efficient
while
the
active
is
in
effect
when
alone.
For
each
boosted
allied
champion,
the
item's
gold
efficiency
increases
by
108%
,
reaching
up
to
626%
gold
efficiency
with
a
full
team
(
410%
on
the
Twisted
Treeline
).

Notes
Upgrading
Nomad's
Medallion
to
Talisman
of
Ascension
does
not
improve
its
ability
to
generate
gold.
Talisman
of
Ascension
's
movement
speed
boost
is
especially
useful
for
the
advantage
it
provides
a
team
when
initiating
or
exiting
a
teamfight.
On
Summoner's
Rift
,
assuming
Talisman
of
Ascension
's
user
is
within
range
of
all
minion
deaths
in
a
lane,
it
provides
8.
3
gold
per
10
seconds
before
the
35-minute
mark.
After
35
minutes,
it
provides
8.
7
gold
per
10
.
Trivia
Ancient
Coin
,
Nomad's
Medallion
,
and
Talisman
of
Ascension
are
all
tied
to
Shurima
Desert
.
The
items'
captions
reference
Miyuki
"Shurelia"
Mitsuhashi
,
a
former
Associate
Game
Designer
at
Riot
Games
.
These
captions
were
added
in
response
to
negative
feedback
that
renaming
Shurelya's
Reverie
was
an
attack
on
Shurelia's
legacy.
[2]
Additionally,
Talisman
of
Ascension
can
still
be
found
by
searching
for
Shurelya's
Reverie
.
Face
of
the
Mountain
,
Frost
Queen's
Claim
,
and
Talisman
of
Ascension
are
a
trio
of
items
designed
for
supports
and
themed
after
locations
from
the
game's
lore.
Talisman
of
Ascension
provides
the
second-highest
movement
speed
buff
available
from
an
item
when
activated—10%
less
than
that
of
Mercurial
Scimitar
.
However,
Talisman
of
Ascension
can
affect
multiple
champions,
lasts
2
seconds
longer
and
does
not
have
the
restriction
of
melee
champions.
Talisman
of
Ascension
contains
two
likely
references
to
Dark
Souls
:
"Praise
the
sun"
is
an
in-game
idiom
,
used
by
both
the
player
and
non-player
characters;
and
September
22
is
Dark
Souls'
release
date.
