Profile
Hailing
from
the
competitive
Warcraft
3
scene,
David
“Top
5
World”
“Phreak”
Bringing
his
Northern
California
pride
with
him,
David
(known
as
Phreak
in
the
Riot
office)
was
told
by
his
pro-team’s
manager’s
ex-roommate
David
Dunne
to
apply
for
an
internship
at
Riot.
After
taking
#1
on
the
normal
games
ladder
in
December
2009
and
proving
that
he
could
talk
just
as
fast
when
referencing
League
of
Legends,
he
was
instantly
hired
and
stuck
out
to
make
a
name
for
himself
in
the
eyes
of
all
the
League’s
summoners.
Notable
phrases
Phreak
is
known
for
several
of
his
signature
phrases,
which
have
become
staples
in
League
of
Legends
culture.
Get
on
my
Level
:
Phreak
is
known
for
many
battle
cries
on
the
Fields
of
Justice
.
Phreak’s
most
notable
exclamation
is
urging
opponents
to
"get
on
[his]
level."
That
said,
Phreak
gives
out
first
blood
in
about
40%
of
his
games.
[Citation
needed]
I
play
this
champion
as
a
jungler:
In
his
champion
spotlights,
Phreak
declares
that
he
is
willing
to
play
every
champion
as
a
jungler.
Tons
of
Damage
:
Phreak
enjoys
dealing
tons
of
damage,
most
commonly
with
his
favorite
item
Trinity
Force
.
Know
to
use
terms
such
as:
Was
exploded,
a
offensiving
move,
revelation
of
coins,
some
anothers.
Trivia
Fun
Fact
-
Phreak
is
also
known
as
an
amateur
dance
performer
.
In
wake
of
this
video
the
now
semi-popular
phrase
"Tons
of
Dance
Moves"
has
appeared.
Phreak
is
responsible
for
videos
released
by
Riot
Games,
such
as
the
Champion
Spotlights
and
Patch
Previews.
Phreak
himself
became
a
meme
in
the
League
of
Legends
fanbase,
typically
due
to
him
using
his
catchphrase
"tons
of
damage"
excessively
in
his
Champion
Spotlight
and
jungling
with
unorthodox
junglers.
One
of
the
earliest
examples
of
that
are
the
old
Sivir
champion
spotlight
in
which
he
recommends
players
to
run
Smite
and
Rally
and
jungle
with
Sivir
and
the
Irelia
champion
spotlight
in
which
he
states
that
she's
a
good
jungler,
while
in
reality
she
was
sub-par
at
the
role
at
best.
Since
then
Phreak
has
greatly
improved
his
Champion
Spotlights
but
still
refers
to
these
memes
jokingly.
