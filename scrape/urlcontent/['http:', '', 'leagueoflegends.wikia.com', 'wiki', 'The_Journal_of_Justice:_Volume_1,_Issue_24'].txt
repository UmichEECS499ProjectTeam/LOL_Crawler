Boram
Darkwill
Assassinated
Swain:
“A
clear
declaration
of
war”
Quinton
Groat
reporting
from
Kalamanda
Swain
holds
vigil
as
the
bodies
of
fallen
Noxian
soldiers
are
put
to
flame.
Things
went
from
worse
to
worst
in
Kalamanda
today
as
General
Boram
Darkwill
and
his
accompanying
platoon
of
Raedsel
Guardsman
were
found
slain
on
the
roads
not
far
from
the
village.
The
massacre
was
discovered
by
a
Noxian
company
dispatched
from
Kalamanda
to
rendezvous
with
and
escort
Darkwill
and
his
men
across
the
last
leg
of
the
journey.
Analysis
of
the
scene
indicates
that
the
entire
troop
was
eliminated
with
terrifying
efficiency.
Noxian
scouts
haven’t
found
any
traces
of
an
attacking
force
or
any
signs
of
survivors.
The
caravan
seems
to
have
been
taken
completely
by
surprise,
which
is
confusing
considering
that
the
site
of
the
ambush
is
flat
and
open
with
little
vegetation
or
terrain.
Swain
ordered
that
the
bodies
of
every
slain
Noxian
soldier
be
put
to
fire,
as
is
the
Noxian
ceremony
for
fallen
ranking
officers
in
wartime
conditions.
“This
atrocity
could
only
have
been
perpetrated
by
one
group,”
insisted
Jericho
Swain,
the
presiding
Noxian
authority
in
Kalamanda.
“The
Raedsel
Guard
is
comprised
of
Noxus’
most
ruthless
and
vicious
soldiers.
A
platoon
of
Raedsel
is
worth
a
regiment
of
infantrymen.I
don’t
know
how
the
Demacians
overcame
them
before
they
could
signal
our
forces
in
Kalamanda,
but
no
other
military
on
this
continent
could
mount
such
an
assault.
This
is
a
clear
declaration
of
war.”
In
a
public
response,
King
Jarvan
III
of
Demacia
decried
the
attack.
“This
is
a
horrific
tragedy.
It’s
no
secret
that
Demacian
and
Noxian
forces
have
opposed
each
other
on
numerous
occasions,
but
General
Darkwill
and
I
were
able,
after
so
much
conflict,
to
put
our
rivalries
aside
for
the
greater
good.
I
did
not
order
this
attack.
I
would
never
do
anything
to
threaten
the
peace
we
have
forged.
I
am
willing
to
cooperate
in
any
way
necessary
to
prove
the
truth
of
these
claims.”
Swain’s
declined
Jarvan’s
invitation
to
discuss
the
situation,
which
may
indicate
that
the
damage
is
already
done.
The
last
remaining
natives
of
Kalamanda,
including
the
mayor
and
his
councilmen,
have
been
evacuated
from
the
region.
Security
at
the
Demacian
camp
has
increased,
though
soldiers
have
been
carefully
instructed
to
make
no
show
of
aggression.
For
the
fragile
time
being,
the
sleepy
village
of
Kalamanda
remains
calm
as
all
of
Valoran
waits
to
see
Swain’s
next
move.
Midnight
Sunshine
Baffles
Authorities
Sun
shines
in
the
dead
of
night
from
above
Mt.
Targon
Kaldera
Carnadine
reporting
from
the
Institute
of
War
Residents
at
the
Institute
of
War
and
along
the
Demacian
border
found
themselves
awakened
in
the
middle
of
the
night
by
a
strange
burst
of
sunlight
long
before
the
morning
hours.
Institute
officials
suspect
Mt.
Targon
as
the
event’s
point
of
origin
and
have
dispatched
investigators
to
the
area.
Late
last
night,
a
thick
layer
of
clouds
blocked
most
of
the
moon
and
starlight
throughout
southwestern
Demacia
and
the
wetlands
south
of
the
Institute
of
War.
Multiple
witness
accounts
throughout
the
area
claim
that
a
beam
of
intense
sunlight
pierced
this
veil
of
clouds
and
brightened
the
land
for
miles
around
its
point
of
origin
for
nearly
ten
minutes.
“I
thought
I
might
be
going
mad!
The
late
nights
get
to
me
sometimes,
but
not
like
this,”
said
Rhyvian
Nazar,
a
Demacian
patrolman
stationed
near
the
border.
“It
was
like
someone
had
called
down
the
sun
itself.”
Many
residents
at
the
Institute
of
War
offer
similar
accounts
of
the
event.
“I
woke
up
and
I
thought
it
must
be
morning.
From
here,
we
could
clearly
see
a
beam
of
sunlight
pour
down
through
the
clouds
over
Mt.
Targon,”
said
one
member
of
the
Institute’s
night
guard.
“I
could
see
the
mountain’s
silhouette
perfectly
on
the
horizon.”
Normally,
Mt.
Targon
is
only
visible
from
the
Institute
during
the
day,
and
only
when
the
sky
is
cloudless.
It
is
never
visible
at
night.
Given
the
probable
connection
between
the
event
and
Mt.
Targon,
Institute
officials
reached
League
Champion
Pantheon
for
comment.
Pantheon
is
native
to
Mt.
Targon
and
his
tribe,
the
Rakkor,
live
upon
its
slopes.
“There
is
a
small
sect
of
the
Rakkor
who
devote
their
lives
to
the
worship
of
the
sun
rather
than
the
glory
of
war,”
Pantheon
told
authorities.
“They
are
a
small
but
vital
aspect
of
our
culture,
but
none
of
them
hold
the
power
to
perform
such
a
feat
as
to
call
down
the
sun
itself…
unless....”
The
Artisan
of
War
declined
to
comment
further.
The
event
does
not
seem
to
have
had
any
immediately
adverse
effects
on
the
environment
or
the
populated
areas
near
the
Demacian
border.
While
some
believe
the
strange
event
to
be
naught
but
another
of
Runeterra
’s
strange
magical
phenomenon,
Institute
investigation
will
remain
vigorous.
“This
is
magic
unlike
anything
we’ve
ever
witnessed,”
said
Mycroft
Zimmer
of
the
Institute’s
Division
of
Magical
Disturbances.
“As
part
of
the
Institute’s
mandate
on
cataloguing
and
analyzing
all
magical
energies
in
Valoran,
identifying
the
cause
of
this
anomaly
has
become
our
top
priority.”
Piltover
Wins
Annual
Zeppelin
Race
Zaun’s
protest
of
Piltovian
victory
overruled
Kaldera
Carnadine
reporting
from
Piltover
League
Champion
Janna's
record-breaking
zeppelin
“Tailwind,”
unveiled
earlier
this
year,
has
defeated
the
Zaunite
flagship
“Lead
Zeppelin”
at
the
annual
Techmaturgical
Conference
in
Piltover
.
Zaunite
competitors
contested
the
victory,
claiming
that
the
new
“chrono-propeller”
engine
of
the
Tailwind
allowed
the
craft
to
navigate
through
Bluewind
Bay’s
storms
utterly
unfettered.
Conference
officials,
however,
overruled
their
protest.
Tensions
between
Piltover
and
Zaun
have
grown
heated
over
the
past
few
months
leading
up
to
the
Conference.
The
technology
behind
Piltover’s
chrono-propeller
engine
has
been
a
source
of
strain
on
the
Piltovian
side,
as
the
design
reportedly
had
not
seen
thorough
testing
prior
to
the
race.
“We
could
not
have
known
whether
or
not
the
new
engine’s
time
manipulation
magic
would
work
at
all.
In
fact,
it
isn’t
even
perfected,”
said
Janna,
Tailwind’s
pilot.
“We
will
be
researching
the
full
capabilities
of
our
chrono-propeller
for
years
to
come.”
The
highly-anticipated
race
began
in
Piltover
and
turned
westward,
following
a
day-long
course
along
the
Ironspine
Mountains
to
Zaun.
The
racing
zeppelins
then
made
the
treacherous
journey
across
Bluewind
Bay,
notorious
for
its
early
summer
storms.
“The
Bay
stretch
of
the
race
is
always
the
most
dramatic,”
said
race
coordinator
Flint
Mackay.
“I’ve
seen
airships
struck
by
lightning
plenty
of
times
in
my
day,
or
blown
terribly
off
course
by
the
wind.
Even
if
someone’s
ahead
for
most
of
the
race,
everything
comes
down
to
The
Bay.”
This
year,
Zaun’s
“Lead
Zeppelin”
maintained
a
strong
lead
from
the
race’s
start
in
Piltover.
The
Zaunite
flagship,
a
powerhouse
of
black
metal
and
Zaunite
techmaturgy,
has
claimed
victory
at
the
Conference
for
the
past
four
years.
As
the
two
zeppelins
crossed
the
bay,
however,
Tailwind’s
chrono-propeller
engine
secured
Piltover’s
victory.
“The
chrono-propeller’s
magic
worked
well
enough
to
project
a
small
temporal
zone
around
the
Tailwind,”
explained
League
Champion
Zilean
,
who
assisted
in
the
propellor’s
design.
“While
the
Zaunites
suffered
through
the
whims
of
the
storm,
our
temporal
manipulation
allowed
for
us
to
pass
through
the
storm
as
though
it
didn’t
exist
around
us—we
were
suspended
in
another
time.
A
better,
less
stormy
time.”
After
Tailwind
sailed
into
Piltover
hours
before
Zaun’s
Lead
Zeppelin,
Zaunite
representatives
immediately
contested
the
victory,
claiming
that
the
chrono-propeller
gave
Piltover
an
unfair
advantage.
Conference
officials
overruled
the
protest:
“The
spirit
of
the
Techmaturgical
Conference
is
innovation,”
explained
Ezzle
Springworthy,
one
of
the
race’s
judges.
“Piltover’s
victory
demonstrates
their
superior
innovation
over
Zaun
in
the
field
of
zeppelin
techmaturgy.
We
will
not
revoke
this
victory.”
League
Champions
Janna
and
Zilean
expressed
their
excitement
to
continue
their
work
on
the
chrono-propeller
in
preparation
for
next
year’s
race
while
Zaunite
competitors
noted
their
intention
to
“make
something
better.”

Senior
Summoner
Ralston
Farnsley
commenting
from
the
Institute
of
War
From
Bandle
City
to
Kalamanda
to
the
Institute
of
War,
it’s
been
another
long
week
of
dramatic
and
strange
events
across
the
whole
of
Valoran.
Let
it
be
known
that
the
Journal
of
Justice
staff,
after
such
consistent
chaos,
takes
great
pleasure
in
reading
and
answering
mail
from
you,
our
loyal
readers.
My
question
is
for
Dr.
Mundo
…
or
maybe
about
him
or
it,
depending
on
circumstances.
Is
the
marvelous
and/or
grotesque
purple
metamorphosis
permanent?
Or
does
he
have
the
choice
to
be
in
that
state
and
continues
to
be?
Can
he
continue
his
beloved
research
as
his
other
persona?
I
would
enjoy
the
more
insight
on
one
of
my
most
favored
summoned
champions.
–
Keatz
Among
Zaunites,
such
a
thing
as
Mundo’s
‘purple
metamorphosis’
is
not
entirely
unusual.
Many
citizens
who
volunteer
themselves
to
Zaun’s
alchemists
and
chemists
in
the
spirit
of
scientific
pursuit
exhibit
similar
visible
results
of
such
endeavors,
be
it
violet
skin
or
teeth
that
glow
in
the
dark,
and
bear
them
proudly.
Dr.
Mundo,
however,
is
among
a
small
few
to
perform
such
experimentation
on
himself.
I
interrupted
one
such
session
in
which
the
Doctor
had
amassed
a
collection
of
no
less
than
twenty
vials
of
strange,
viscous
fluid
connected
by
tube
to
his
own
flesh
to
garner
an
answer
to
your
questions:
“Mundo
prefer
‘marvelous,’
not
‘grotesque.’
Mundo
like
purple,
and
so
do
Mundo’s
fans.
Mundo
could
perform
scientific
endeavor
to
reverse
effects
of
other
experiments
if
he
pleased,
but
Mundo
enjoy
being
walking
image
of
Zaunite
progress.”
It
occurs
to
me
that
champions
Maokai
and
Malphite
share
striking
similarities;
neither
champion
chose
the
life
of
a
league
champion,
both
have
bodies
consisting
of
the
raw
material
of
the
natural
world,
and
both
once
occupied
a
much
simpler
existence
in
their
natural
environments.
Have
the
two
of
them
over
conversed
on
these
similar
origins?
–
Agamond
At
the
Institute
of
War,
both
Maokai
and
Malphite
prefer
solitude
and
introspection
to
engagement
with
their
champion
fellows.
I
managed,
however,
to
coax
a
response
from
Malphite
as
he
meditated
near
the
caverns
surrounding
the
Institute.
“Yes.
Maokai.
We
bear
the
same
burden…
the
longing
for
peace.
But
Maokai
lets
his
rage
consume
him.
He
sees
only
the
curse
of
life,
not
its
gift.
With
a
curse,
we
are
doomed
to
pain
and
torment.
With
a
gift,
we
gain
the
power
to
fight
for
peace.
Nonetheless…
I
am
proud
to
call
the
Twisted
Treant
my
ally.”

ZaineDraconis
I
must
admit
my
shock:
LeBlanc
has
been,
in
the
past,
has
expressed
a
pointed
disinterest
in
answering
the
questions
we
bring
to
her.
I
hope
you
are
as
pleased
as
I
am
surprised
that
LeBlanc
spent
a
long
while
reviewing
and
crafting
a
response
to
your
inquiries.
It
was
her
personal
request
that
I
deliver
this
to
you
exactly
as
she
quoted
it
to
me:
“Don't
ever
garden
uninformed,
worry
can
quickly
ensue!
I
think
you
should
know
a
little
or
all
you
possibly
can
about
anything
you
do.
These
tactics
can
save
petty
costs
or
prevent
threats
from
ruining
everything.
There,
in
many
instances,
are
a
couple
or
several
tricks
to
help
factions
who
garden
frequently,
intent
on
consistency.
Books
on
the
subject
say
eliminating
pests
is
paramount.
Our
gardeners
focus
on
organization,
seeds
in
place,
but
it
is
important
we
remember
our
roots:
remain,
above
all
else,
informed.
Thank
you
for
your
thoughts.
With
plants,
loyalty,
or
rather
devotion,
will
yield
best
results.
Be
attentive,
loving,
and
rewarded
you
will
be.
When
we
have
trouble,
we
adhere
to
the
rule:
look
at
it
all
and
decide
which
of
your
options
works.
Noxus
thrives
this
way.”
