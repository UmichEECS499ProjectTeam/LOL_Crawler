Driven
by
an
intense
killer
instinct,
Katarina
uses
her
talents
as
an
assassin
for
the
glory
of
Noxus,
and
the
continued
elevation
of
her
family.
While
her
fervor
drives
her
to
ever-greater
feats,
it
can
sometimes
lead
her
astray.
From
childhood,
Katarina
displayed
a
natural
gift
for
combat.
As
the
daughter
of
a
prominent
Noxian
general,
many
paths
were
open
to
her,
but
she
rejected
them
all
for
the
path
of
the
blade.
Rigorously
trained
by
the
finest
assassins
in
Noxus,
her
father
the
best
among
them,
it
was
not
long
before
Katarina
demanded
her
first
assignment.
The
task
they
gave
her
was
aggravatingly
simple:
assassinate
a
low-ranking
Demacian
officer.
As
she
set
to
her
work
infiltrating
the
enemy
camp,
Katarina
discovered
an
opportunity
too
tantalizing
to
pass
by
–
the
arrival
of
a
Demacian
General.
Stalking
him
to
his
tent,
she
quietly
dispatched
his
guards
and
slit
his
throat.
Pleased
with
her
impressive
kill,
she
disappeared
into
the
night.
Katarina's
elation
faded
the
next
day
when
her
original
objective,
the
Demacian
officer,
led
his
forces
to
ambush
unprepared
Noxian
soldiers.
Though
the
Noxians
fought
valiantly,
they
suffered
heavy
casualties.
Furious
at
her
mistake,
Katarina
set
off
to
complete
her
original
task.
Returning
to
the
camp,
she
spied
her
now
heavily
guarded
target
and
realized
a
stealthy
kill
was
no
longer
possible.
Drawing
her
blades,
Katarina
swore
the
officer
would
die,
no
matter
the
cost.
She
leapt
into
battle,
unleashing
a
whirlwind
of
steel.
One
by
one
blades
flashed
and
guards
fell,
each
strike
bringing
her
one
step
closer
to
the
officer.
A
final
thrown
dagger
restored
her
honor.
Bloody
and
bruised,
Katarina
barely
escaped
the
Demacian
forces,
and
returned
to
Noxus
a
changed
woman.
The
scar
she
earned
that
night
now
serves
as
a
constant
reminder
that
she
must
never
let
passion
interfere
with
duty.
"Never
question
my
loyalty.
You
will
never
know
what
I
endure
for
it."
―
Katarina
As
a
militaristic
state,
it
would
perhaps
come
as
no
surprise
that
the
primary
responsibilities
of
Noxian
women
are
raising
strong
children
and
providing
succor
for
husbands
who
walk
the
path
of
soldiery.
There
are
some,
however,
for
whom
nurture
is
not
nature,
and
Katarina
is
just
such
a
creature.
Born
the
daughter
of
the
feared
Noxian
General
Du
Couteau,
the
girl
was
always
more
interested
in
her
father's
knives
than
in
the
dresses,
jewelry,
and
other
trifles
that
her
sister
spent
so
much
time
fussing
over.
A
childhood
dispute
soon
unveiled
her
uncanny
knack
for
bloodshed,
and
her
father,
ever
the
opportunist,
happily
fostered
her
killer
instincts.
After
training
under
the
tutelage
of
the
finest
assassins
the
mighty
city-state
had
to
offer,
Katarina
first
cut
her
teeth
performing
assassinations
in
the
Ionian
War.
There,
her
ruthless
mastery
of
the
knife
and
dagger
combined
with
her
sadistic
temperament
to
earn
her
the
title
Sinister
Blade,
a
moniker
that
would
follow
her
for
the
remainder
of
her
career.
She
is
most
famous,
however,
for
her
exploits
in
the
campaigns
against
Demacia
,
especially
those
surrounding
her
engagements
with
the
nation's
champion,
Garen
;
a
rivalry
which
began
when
she
recovered
the
remains
of
Sion
from
a
vanguard
under
his
protection.
With
the
demand
for
warfare
somewhat
arrested
by
the
tenuous
peace
settling
over
Valoran
,
Katarina
sought
the
allure
of
violence
in
its
last
remaining
haven:
The
League
of
Legends
.
Some
might
say
it
was
an
inevitability
that
Katarina's
chosen
path
would
draw
her
to
become
a
champion
of
the
League,
continuing
to
enforce
the
will
of
Noxus
and
bring
prestige
of
war
to
her
noble
family.
There,
she
continues
to
perform
her
bloody
work
-
esteemed
and
reviled,
feared
and
adored.
"The
Sinister
Blade
of
Noxus
is
like
a
black
widow
-
beautiful,
but
deadly."
―
Garen,
the
Might
of
Demacia
,
following
a
skirmish
in
the
field
This
draft
bio
written
by
RiotRaven
on
the
PBE
but
was
updated
after
community
feedback.
Born
to
Noxian
privilege,
Katarina
trained
in
the
ways
of
the
knife
from
the
time
she
was
a
child.
Now
that
fiery,
willful
child
has
grown
into
a
beautiful
and
deadly
woman.
Katarina's
intense
passion
for
life
is
tempered
by
a
sense
of
duty
and
loyalty
to
her
family.
That
same
passion
proves
a
double-edged
sword
when
her
heart
and
her
responsibilities
are
at
odds.
As
the
free-spirited
daughter
of
a
prominent
Noxian
general,
the
young
Katarina
was
given
the
best
of
everything.
Naturally
gifted
in
combat,
she
found
herself
drawn
to
blades.
Much
to
her
family's
pride,
she
trained
under
the
deadliest
assassins
in
the
Noxian
military.
It
wasn't
long
before
Katarina's
instructors
deemed
her
worthy
of
a
trial
by
fire
–
to
kill
a
prominent
Demacian
soldier.
Creeping
through
the
darkened
military
camp,
Katarina
was
overwhelmed
by
her
passion
to
prove
herself.
When
the
army's
General
strayed
across
her
path,
unguarded,
she
quietly
slit
his
throat.
Katarina
disappeared
into
the
night,
pleased
with
her
impressive
kill.
Her
elation
was
soon
crushed,
as
the
next
day
her
original
target
–
the
prominent
soldier
who
was
the
true
military
genius
–
led
his
forces
to
ambush
unprepared
Noxian
soldiers.
Katarina
flung
herself
into
the
fray
to
correct
her
mistake,
earning
a
scar
over
her
left
eye
as
a
permanent
reminder.
Even
though
she
finally
completed
her
task,
her
family's
reputation
was
damaged.
Since
that
day,
Katarina
vowed
to
never
let
passion
prevent
her
from
bringing
glory
to
both
Noxus
and
her
family.
Reconciling
her
desires
with
her
duty
proves
to
be
a
constant
challenge.
To
the
world,
Katarina
is
a
symbol
of
Noxian
patriotism,
though
there
is
more
to
the
red-haired
assassin
than
meets
the
eye.
"Never
question
my
loyalty.
You
will
never
know
what
I
endure
for
it."

Relaunch:
Katarina,
the
Sinister
Blade
Announcement
made
by
NeeksNaman
:
[1]
This
patch
,
we’ll
be
overhauling
one
of
our
classic
champions:
Katarina,
the
Sinister
Blade.
Although
Katarina's
manaless,
cooldown-based
abilities
put
a
unique
spin
on
her
gameplay,
she's
historically
faced
a
number
of
challenges
in
the
very
early
game
and
in
team
fight
situations.
In
this
update,
we’ve
made
a
few
changes
to
her
kit
aimed
at
addressing
these
difficulties,
while
retaining
the
core
elements
that
make
playing
this
Noxian
femme
fatale
a
fun
and
satisfying
experience.
We
also
gave
her
a
complete
visual
upgrade,
including
a
new
model,
animations
and
spell
effects
on
all
of
her
abilities!
Katarina's
New
Abilities
Voracity
(Passive):
Champion
kills
or
assists
reduce
Death
Lotus'
cooldown
and
refresh
your
basic
abilities.
Bouncing
Blades:
Katarina
throws
a
dagger
that
bounces
from
enemy
to
enemy,
dealing
magic
damage
and
marking
them.
Striking
a
marked
target
with
an
ability
or
basic
attack
will
consume
the
mark
to
deal
additional
magic
damage.
Sinister
Steel:
Katarina
whirls
her
daggers
around
her,
dealing
magic
damage
to
all
enemies
in
the
area.
If
she
hits
an
enemy
champion,
Katarina
gains
Movement
Speed
for
a
short
duration.
Shunpo:
Katarina
instantly
moves
to
her
target's
location
and
takes
reduced
damage
from
enemies
for
a
short
duration.
If
the
target
is
an
enemy,
she
deals
damage.
Death
Lotus
(Ultimate):
Katarina
becomes
a
flurry
of
blades,
throwing
daggers
with
unrivaled
speed
at
up
to
three
nearby
champions.
Daggers
deal
magic
damage
and
reduce
incoming
healing
on
targets
hit.

The
first
problem
that
Katarina
players
often
faced
was
weak
performance
very
early
on,
primarily
related
to
the
steep
damage
curve
of
her
core
damage
ability,
Bouncing
Blades.
While
Bouncing
Blades
scales
dramatically
as
it
levels
up,
early
on
it
ricochets
only
a
few
times,
dealing
relatively
low
damage.
This
forces
Katarina
players
to
play
conservatively
early
in
the
laning
phase,
encouraging
passive
play
until
Bouncing
Blades
can
be
used
to
harass
effectively.
To
address
this
disparity,
we
normalized
the
damage
inflicted
by
Bouncing
Blades
and
made
it
bounce
the
same
number
of
times
at
every
level
of
the
skill.
In
addition,
each
ricochet
will
now
select
the
nearest
available
target
instead
of
bouncing
randomly.
This
change
should
both
facilitate
interesting
counter-play
for
opponents
and
open
up
new
harassment
opportunities
for
advanced
Katarina
players
who
are
able
to
predict
where
their
daggers
are
going
to
bounce.
In
addition
to
her
early
game
difficulties,
Katarina's
reliance
on
the
massive
damage
potential
of
Death
Lotus
has
always
made
her
a
challenging
champion
to
balance.
A
fully
channeled
ultimate
could
quickly
reduce
a
team
to
ashes,
but
a
well-timed
interrupt
from
a
canny
defender
could
quickly
transform
Katarina
from
a
maelstrom
of
death
into
an
easy
kill.
For
this
reason,
we
decided
to
move
the
healing
debuff
from
Killer
Instincts
onto
Death
Lotus
and
decrease
the
channel
time
slightly.
This
reigned
in
the
overall
damage
numbers
slightly,
replacing
some
of
this
raw
punishment
with
a
bit
of
utility
gave
us
the
opportunity
to
make
remainder
of
Katarina's
kit
more
dangerous.
To
accomplish
this,
we
swapped
Killer
Instincts
for
a
spammable,
area-of-effect
attack
that
grants
Katarina
a
brief
speed
boost
when
it
lands.
This
new
ability,
dubbed
Sinister
Steel,
gives
Katarina
superior
mobility
and
allows
her
to
continue
laying
down
damage
on
multiple
targets
during
a
team
fight
if
Death
Lotus
is
interrupted
by
a
stun
or
knockback.
For
a
little
added
kick,
Bouncing
Blades
will
now
apply
a
debuff
that
is
consumed
to
deal
bonus
damage
when
Katarina
strikes
the
target
with
an
attack
or
ability.
These
changes
should
give
Katarina
the
extra
damage
she
needs
to
play
aggressively
right
out
the
gates
and
the
flexibility
necessary
to
keep
her
damage
potential
high
once
the
team
fights
start.
This
brand
new
take
on
Katarina,
the
Sinister
Blade,
will
be
baring
her
blades
in
an
upcoming
patch.
We
hope
you’re
ready!
