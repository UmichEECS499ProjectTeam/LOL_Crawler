Trivia
Fiora
was
designed
by
Volty
.
Fiora
is
voiced
by
Karen
Strassman
,
who
also
voices
Cassiopeia
,
Shyvana
,
Zyra
,
and
Elise
.
Fiora's
sword
fighting
style
is
based
on
fencing
,
and
her
character
concept
is
inspired
by
an
unspecified
historical
French
fencer
,
possibly
Julie
D'Aubigny.
[1]
[2]
Fiora
also
has
a
caricatural
French
accent.
The
name
Fiora
derives
from
"Fiore",
the
Italian
word
for
"Flower",
which
may
be
a
reference
to
Fiore
Dei
Liberi,
an
Italian
fencing
master.
"Fioretto"
is
also
Italian
for
one
of
the
three
fencing
disciplines,
namely
the
Foil.
Fiora's
dance
is
a
reference
to
Fred
Astaire's
dance
in
the
movie
Blue
Skies
,
with
the
song
Puttin'
on
the
Ritz
.
A
side-by-side
comparison
can
be
seen
here
.
Fiora's
taunt
animation
is
derived
from
the
"salute"
in
honor
duel
tradition
(retained
in
sports
fencing
today);
where
opponents
would
raise
their
swords
to
each
other
at
the
beginning
and
conclusion
of
a
duel,
bout
or
sparring
session.
Pictures
on
her
Duelist
and
Blade
Waltz
are
not
her
classic
skin,
but
instead
her
Nightraven
skin.
Her
ultimate
is
comparable
to
that
of
Yurnero,
the
Juggernaut
from
DotA
,
which
also
pays
homage
to
Final
Fantasy
VII
main
protagonist
Cloud
Strife's
Ability
'Omnislash'.
All
three
consist
of
dancing
across
the
battlefield
slashing
at
random
targets.
Cloud's
moves
can
be
seen
here
(FF7)
and
here
(CGI
Movie).
Fiora's
Burst
of
Speed
is
very
similar
to
the
Assassin
move
of
the
same
name
in
Diablo
II
,
with
almost
identical
particles
and
effects.
Quotes
Fiora's
quote
"prepare
to
die"
is
likely
a
reference
to
Inigo
Montoya
from
the
movie
The
Princess
Bride
.
His
full
quote:
"Hello.
My
name
is
Inigo
Montoya.
You
killed
my
father.
Prepare
to
die."
Fiora's
second
taunt
"I
like
you.
I
hate
to
kill
you"
is
also
a
likely
reference
to
Inigo
Montoya.
His
quote:
"You
seem
a
decent
fellow.
I
hate
to
kill
you."
During
Fiora's
jokes,
she
draws
Teemo's
face
in
the
air.
Relations
Fiora
is
rivals
with
Jax
and
Lux,
Lux
because
of
her
Crownguard
heritage
as
well
as
being
too
optimistic
for
her.
And
Jax
due
to
him
being
one
of
the
finest
fighters
known
in
Runeterra
with
his
unmatched
mastery
of
weapons.
Skins
Royal
Guard
Fiora
is
likely
a
reference
to
the
Musketeers
of
the
Guard
,
a
fighting
company
of
the
French
monarchy.
Royal
Guard
Fiora's
splash
art
is
the
only
one
in
which
she
is
holding
the
blades
in
a
left-handed
fashion,
with
the
rapier
in
her
left-hand
and
a
parrying
dagger
(main-gauche)
in
her
right,
though
the
character
model
for
this
skin
still
has
her
holding
the
rapier
in
her
right-hand.
In
Nightraven
Fiora's
skin,
the
rapier's
hilt
is
based
on
the
Italian
"Swept
Hilt"
design.
Though
all
of
Fiora's
splash
arts
show
her
with
a
parrying
dagger
in
her
off-hand,
none
of
her
character
models
actually
have
her
holding
the
dagger.
In
her
original
animation
for
Riposte
,
Fiora
was
supposed
to
use
her
main-gauche
to
parry
the
oncoming
enemy
attack.
This
animation
was
removed
due
to
it
commonly
having
timing
issues.
Before
the
announcing
of
the
skin
names,
the
Royal
Guard
skin
was
nicknamed
the
Musketeer
skin
and
the
Nightraven
was
nicknamed
the
Zorro
skin
by
the
community.
The
Nightraven
skin
had
a
different
character
model
before
the
final
design
and
was
nicknamed
the
Armoured
skin.
In
the
old
character
model,
the
cape
was
on
the
opposite
shoulder
and
Fiora
had
a
neck
guard.
Headmistress
Fiora
is
a
reference
to
the
cliché
most
commonly
occurring
in
American
sitcoms
in
which
a
teacher
would
end
up
being
hugely
attractive
and
would
be
a
flirty
icon
to
either
students
or
parents
or
other
staff.
It
was
a
skin
recommended
by
the
community
and
was
released
for
Harrowing
2012
.
