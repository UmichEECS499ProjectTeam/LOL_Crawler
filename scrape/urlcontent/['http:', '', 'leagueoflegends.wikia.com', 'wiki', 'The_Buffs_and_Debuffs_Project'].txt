Buffs
In
this
section
appear
the
buffs
that
appear
by

a

You
can
add
information
about
whether
it
appears
on
yourself,
an
ally
or
an
enemy;
and
whether
its
a
buff
or
debuff
to
the
target.
You
must
add
what
ability
cause
it
and
if
it
has
a
counter
(like
Relentless
Assault
).
You
don't
have
to
information
about
how
it
is
obtained
or
how
much
it
lasts,
as
this
can
be
inferred
by

the
champion's
page.
Try
to
choose
a
champion
and
add
every
single
buff
related
to
it.

any
doubts
you
have
on
