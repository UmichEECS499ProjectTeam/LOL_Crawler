Grez
The
Lizard
Lord
was
a
neutral
monster
in
League
of
Legends
described
in
game
as
"A
melee
monster
with
large
amounts
of
health.
Killing
this
foe
grants
a
slowing
attack
that
deals
damage
over
time.".
It
used
to
spawn
on
Twisted
Treeline
,
in
the
center
of
the
map
with
no
other
monsters
around
it.
When
killed,
Grez
granted
his
killer
the
Blessing
of
the
Lizard
Elder
buff,
where
every
hit
deals
10-44
(10
at
level

increasing
by
2
damage
for
every
level
gained)
bonus
true
damage
twice
and
slows
enemies

for
melee
or
5/10/15%
for
ranged
attacks)
for
3
seconds.
