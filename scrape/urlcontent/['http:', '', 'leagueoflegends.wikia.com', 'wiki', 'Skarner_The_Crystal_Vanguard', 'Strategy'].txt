Skill

Skarner
excels
at
chasing
down
difficult
targets
with
his
unique,
utility-based
kit,
while
providing
sustainability
in
both
damage
and
health.
These
skills
are
best
used
as
a
jungler
for
effective
ganks.
Energize
is
a
powerful
passive
effect
that
allows
Skarner
to
reduce
the
cooldown
of
all
his
abilities
simply
by
auto-attacking
enemies.
This
passive
synergizes
strongly
with
attack
speed
items
such
as
Wit's
End
.
The
faster
Skarner
can
attack,
the
faster
his
abilities
will
become
available
again.
Don't
be
afraid
to
clear
jungle
camps
at
a
slower
pace
by
foregoing
the
use
of
Crystal
Slash
for
Crystalline
Exoskeleton
in
order
to
make
use
of
Energize
to
reduce
the
cooldown
of
Skarner's
Impale
,
his
ultimate
ability.
Skarner's
Crystal
Slash
provides
a
constant
source
of
hybrid
damage
in
an
area
around
him
as
well
as
a
stacking
personal
attack
speed
buff.
In
order
for
Crystal
Slash
to
apply
its
bonus
magic
damage
you
must
first
be
'charged'
by
hitting
an
enemy
with
this
ability
at
least
once.
When
ganking,
charge
Crystal
Slash
off
an
enemy
minion
while
on
your
way
to
enemy
targets
to
maximize
your
damage
output.
Crystal
Slash
is
Skarner's
bread
and
butter
when
jungling.
Simply
cast
it
whenever
available
to
quickly
clear
minion
camps
between
objectives
and
ganks.
The
purchase
of
a
Sheen
is
a
powerful
item
thanks
to
the
ability
to
repeatedly
proc
its
passive
effect
with
Crystal
Slash
.
Crystalline
Exoskeleton
provides
Skarner
with
a
shield,
allowing
him
to
soak
up
more
damage
in
all
situations,
and
giving
him
increased
mobility
and
melee
DPS
while
it
holds.
Activate
Crystalline
Exoskeleton
when
ganking
to
quickly
close
the
gap
towards
your
targets.
Be
cautious
not
to
cast
it
too
early
-
if
the
effect
runs
out
before
you
reach
your
target,
they
may
be
easily
able
to
escape.
Using
Crystalline
Exoskeleton
during
fights
in
melee
range
will
give
Skarner
a
noticeable
advantage
over
his
enemy
should
they
be
fighting
back.
Crystalline
Exoskeleton
has
great
synergy
with
Energize
.
By
auto-attacking
faster,
Skarner
can
reduce
his
cooldowns
even
quicker
than
without.
Keep
in
mind
that
Skarner's
movement
and
attack
speed
bonuses
will
only
persist
for
as
long
as
the
shield
remains.
If
the
shield
is
broken
before
the
duration
ends,
the
bonuses
will
still
be
lost.
For
these
reasons,
use
the
additional
mobility
the
shield
provides
to
avoid
skill
shots
or
spells
that
may
break
the
shield.
Fracture
is
Skarner's
only
true
ranged
ability
that
strikes
in
a
line,
dealing
damage
to
all
enemies
it
hits.
It
will
also
apply
a
debuff
on
the
targets,
slowing
them
by
a
percentage.
Casting
Fracture
into
a
quick
strike
of
Crystal
Slash
is
a
popular
and
effective
means
to
keep
your
target
in
range.
Skarner's
Impale
is
his
trademark
ability,
suppressing
an
enemy
target
while
allowing
Skarner
to
freely
move
them
around.
Impale
has
unmatched
utility
when
ganking,
engaging,
disengaging,
or
saving
targets.
Using
Impale
during
a
gank
will
allow
you
to
pull
your
victim
further
away
from
their
turret,
giving
your
friendly
laner
more
time
to
engage
them,
and
yourself
more
space
to
slow
and
damage
them
over.
Casting
Flash
or
using
Talisman
of
Ascension
into
an
Impale
is
a
powerful
way
to
grab
key
enemy
targets
and
pull
them
into
your
team
for
a
quick
kill
during
team
fights.
When
falling
back,
grabbing
strong
enemy
initiators
such
as
Amumu
or
Galio
early
and
pulling
them
further
away
from
your
team
will
put
them
out
of
position
and
make
their
strong
ultimates
ineffective,
saving
them
from
a
hard
engagement.
Skarner
can
easily
pull
away
dangerous
targets
from
a
friendly
carry
using
Impale
,
then
slowing
them
with
Fracture
after
the
link
is
broken.
During
Impale
,
you
will
be
unable
to
cast
Fracture
or
Flash
.
Crystal
Slash
,
Crystalline
Exoskeleton
,
and
other
Summoner
Spells
will
still
remain
available.
Remember
to
cast
Crystal
Slash
before
and
after
using
Impale
to
apply
a
slow
effect
immediately
upon
it
ending,
ensuring
your
victim
cannot
quickly
or
easily
escape
afterwards.
Using
Crystalline
Exoskeleton
will
allow
you
to
pull
your
victim
further
back
than
otherwise.
Impale
drags
the
opponent
directly
behind
Skarner
.
You
can
turn
around
just
before
its
duration
ends
to
flip
the
enemy
to
the
other
side
of
his
character
model,
getting
that
little
bit
more
distance
before
the
enemy
is
released.
Impale
is
uniquely
powerful
compared
to
other
suppression
spells
such
as
Warwick's
Infinite
Duress
and
Malzahar's
Nether
Grasp
,
in
that
it
cannot
be
canceled
by
outside
sources
such
as
stuns
and
silences,
as
it
has
no
channel
time.
It
can
still,
however,
be
broken
by
the
purchase
and
use
of
a
Quicksilver
Sash
by
the
victim.
Be
wary
not
to
spam
all
of
your
spells
as
soon
as
available,
or
you
will
risk
putting
yourself
out
of
mana
quickly
and
before
you
need
it
most.
Save
the
casts
of
Crystal
Slash
for
when
the
attack
speed
buff
ends
to
refresh
it
efficiently.
When
clearing
minions,
cast
it
once
every
five
seconds
to
maintain
its
bonus
magic
damage.
Avoid
using
Crystalline
Exoskeleton
when
not
receiving
damage.
Activating
it
when
an
enemy
turns
to
fight
you
will
give
you
an
immediate
advantage
in
damage
and
tankiness.
Build
usage
Getting
an
item
that
grants
attack
speed
will
help
his
Energize
passive
reduce
cooldowns
faster.
Skarner's
short
cooldowns
and
great
scaling
with
attack
speed
,
attack
damage
,
and
ability
power
make
him
a
perfect
candidate
for
taking
advantage
of
the
cost
effectiveness
of
Guinsoo's
Rageblade
.
Any
of
the
on-hit
effect
items
like
Nashor's
Tooth
or
Wit's
End
are
good
choices
for
attack
speed
items
for
Skarner
.
A
Trinity
Force
is
an
exceptionally
strong
item
for
Skarner
,
Sheen
gives
his
abilities
more
damage
and
gives
him
more
mana
,
Zeal
increases
his
already
strong
chasing
power
by
giving
movement
speed
and
the
attack
speed
works
well
with
his
passive,
Phage
gives
more
chasing
power,
damage
and
provides
some
extra
health
.
The
Sheen
effect
can
be
procced
almost
every
single
time
due
to
his
Energize
passive
reducing
the
cooldowns
of
his
skills
and
the
ability
to
spam
Crystal
Slash
.
Skarner
has
the
highest
attack
damage
at
level
18
and
a
short
cooldown
on
his
Crystal
Slash
and
cooldown
reduction
with
his
Energize
passive,
making
him
probably
the
best
champion
to
make
use
of
Trinity
Force's
passive.
Although
innately
a
hybrid
champion,
Skarner
has
more
abilities
that
scale
with
ability
power
and
pretty
high
ability
power
ratios
when
compared
to
attack
damage
ratios.
Items
that
grant
ability
power
might
be
more
useful.
Also
there
are
more
ability
power
items
that
give
him
what
he
needs
and
synergize
with
Skarner's
unique
kit
than
attack
damage
items
.
Building
Nashor's
Tooth
on
Skarner
gives
him
many
useful
stats.
Its
combination
of
large
cooldown
reduction
and
attack
speed
bonuses
to
proc
his
Energize
passive
gives
him
incredible
ability
to
spam
his
skills.
The
ability
power
is
useful
due
to
his
decent
AP
ratios.
Consider
buying
an
early
Chalice
of
Harmony
if
you
find
Skarner's
mana
regeneration
to
be
problematic.
Because
of
its
unique
combination
of
stats,
Athene's
Unholy
Grail
is
a
not
a
bad
but
situational
and
late
game
item
choice
for
him.
Skarner
has
decent
ability
power
ratios,
can
benefit
from
magic
resistance
,
and
cooldown
reduction
with
his
Energize
passive
can
help
keep
his
abilities
constantly
available.
Lich
Bane
may
be
a
better
item
than
Trinity
Force
in
builds
with
high
amounts
of
ability
power
.
Liandry's
Torment
not
only
gives
useful
stats,
but
its
passive
will
deal
extra
damage
from
Fracture's
slow,
and
it
synergizes
with
his
low
cooldown
AoE
spells.
The
Hextech
Gunblade
is
a
good
item
as
it
gives
a
lot
of
survivability
that
Skarner
needs
in
spell
vamp
and
life
steal
and
more
attack
damage
and
ability
power
for
his
abilities.
Getting
a
Manamune
will
help
with
mana
problems,
but
does
not
grant
much
late
game
utility.
However,
consider
getting
Tear
of
the
Goddess
or
this
if
you
plan
on
spending
a
lot
of
time
activating
abilities
(constantly
jungling
past
lvl
~9).
Combining
Muramana
with
attack
speed
items
tends
to
increase
his
overall
damage
more
so
than
buying
straight
attack
damage
items
(for
example,
infinity
edge).
Building
Spirit
Stone
later
into
Spirit
of
the
Ancient
Golem
provides
a
good
amount
of
health,
health
regeneration
and
allows
you
to
purchase
Boots
of
Swiftness
without
having
to
abandon
Tenacity.
As
Skarner
needs
to
be
very
close
to
his
target
to
do
damage,
any
build
should
look
upon
survivability
items
with
either
health
,
armor
or
magic
resistance
.
Guardian
Angel
and
Aegis
of
the
Legion
are
good
cheap
choices.
If
one
is
looking
for
magic
resistance
and
ability
power
for
Skarner
,
Abyssal
Scepter
is
a
good
pick.
A
Sunfire
Cape
can
be
bought
to
inflict
extra
damage
with
Impale
.
Randuin's
Omen
is
a
strong
item
if
the
enemy
is
kiting
you,
as
it
slows
their
movement
speed
if
they
attack
you.
Randuin's
Omen
doesn't
grant
Skarner
anything
offensively
while
Hextech
Gunblade
and
Bilgewater
Cutlass
also
have
great
slowing
effects
that
are
actives.

Countering
Skarner's
ability
cooldowns
are
very
short
because
of
his
Energize
.
Take
care
when
engaging
him
when
you
think
his
spells
are
on
cooldown.
This
also
makes
immobilizing
effects
much
more
devastating
as
it
ruins
his
CD
reduction.
Skarner's
Crystalline
Exoskeleton
movement
speed
boost
will
persist
only
if
the
shield
is
unbroken,
destroying
his
shield
will
make
the
movement
speed
boost
disappear.
Buy
a
Quicksilver
Sash
to
end
the
suppression
from
Skarner's
Impale
.
Champions
such
as
Alistar
,
Olaf
,
and
Gangplank
also
counter
his
ultimate.
Be
careful
when
turret
diving
a
low
health
Skarner
.
He
can
use
his
Impale
and
drag
you
around
the
turret.
Some
champions
with
a
knockback
ability
(e.g.
Singed's
Fling
or
Alistar's
Headbutt
)
can
help
an
ally
that
is
dragged
by
Skarner's
Impale
.
Use
this
to
make
sure
Skarner
doesn't
drag
them
too
far.
