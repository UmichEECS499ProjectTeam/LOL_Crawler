Trivia
Graves
was
designed
by
FeralPony
.
His
real
name
is
Malcolm
Graves,
as
indicated
by
Twisted
Fate
's
special
taunt
.
Graves
is
voiced
by
Kyle
Hebert
,
Who
also
voices
Ezreal
and
Jarvan
IV
.
Graves
is
an
answer
for
all
the
forum
threads
calling
for
a
"manly"
ranged
carry.
Graves'
concept
is
greatly
inspired
from
the
American
Wild
West
and
the
Western
genre.
His
passive,
True
Grit
,
is
a
reference
to
a
book
and
two
movie
adaptations
(One
in
1969
and
the
other
in
2010
)
by
the
same
name.
Graves
was
mentioned
in
the
Journal
of
Justice:
Issue
29
,
where
he
reportedly
escaped
from
a
secret
prison
owned
by
CEO
Dr.
Priggs,
who
is
later
seen
held
at
gunpoint
in
Graves'
teaser.
Graves'
ex-partner,
Twisted
Fate,
sold
Graves
out
to
Dr.
Priggs
in
exchange
for
entry
into
the
experiment
that
gave
Twisted
Fate
the
ability
to
use
magic.
Graves
named
his
shotgun
"Destiny",
which
is
the
name
of
Twisted
Fate's
ultimate
.
Graves'
jokes
are
related
to
gallows
humor
,
or
humor
that
involve
being
funny
in
the
face
of,
and
in
response
to,
a
perfectly
hopeless
situation.
Graves'
dance
references
from
the
cowboy
dance
during
a
country
show.
A
direct
side-by-side
comparison
can
be
seen
here
.
Graves
is
the
second-to-last
champion
to
have
a
League
Judgement;
the
feature
was
discontinued
after
his
release,
but
Varus
received
a
Judgement
as
part
of
his
promotional
material
by
Penny
Arcade.
When
Graves
is
about
to
crit,
his
weapon
has
extra
recoil
making
his
gun
shoot
up
into
the
air
out
of
his
left
hand.
The
poncho
Graves
wears
in
his
classic
version
is
likely
a
reference
to
the
"Man
with
no
name";
an
iconic
movie
hero
appearing
in
a
trilogy
of
classic
spaghetti
westerns
("The
Good,
the
Bad
and
the
Ugly"
being
the
most
notable).
Graves'
gun
can
be
seen
in
the
video
for
the
Mac
Version
launch
for
League
of
Legends.
Quotes
If
an
enemy
Nocturne
is
hit
by
his
Smokescreen
,
Graves
will
say
"I've
got
your
darkness."
or
"Who's
in
the
dark
now?"
.
Graves'
quote
"I
ain't
got
time
to
bleed."
is
a
direct
reference
to
the
movie
Predator
[1]
.
The
quote
"
Knock,
knock.
"
when
Graves
fires
a
Smokescreen
is
also
a
reference
Predator
[2]
.
Graves'
quote
"Dead
man
walkin."
is
a
reference
to
the
prison
slang
used
for
a
prisoner's
last
walk
to
the
execution
chamber.
Graves'
quote
"Feelin'
lucky?"
is
probably
a
homage
to
Clint
Eastwood,
the
actor
who
portrayed
the
aforementioned
hero.
The
line
"Do
you
feel
lucky,
punk?
Well
do
ya?"
is
Clint
Eastwood's
most
famous
line.
In
Polish
client,
after
using
Smokescreen
,
he
say
"Ciemność
widzę"
(I
see
darkness),
which
is
reference
to
"Seksmisja"
from
1983.
Also
his
joke
"Zawsze
sikasz
przez
zapięty
rozporek?"
(You
always
pee
with
slit
closed?)
is
from
movie
Kiler.
The
interesting
thing
is,
both
quotes
are
said
by
Jerzy
Stuhr.
Also
his
quote
"W
imię
zasad"
(In
the
name
of
the
rules)
and
"Co
Ty
wiesz
o
zabijaniu?"
(What
do
you
know
about
killing
people?)
is
a
reference
to
Franz
Maurer
from
the
movie
Psy
from
1992.
Both
quotes
are
known
to
be
said
by
Bogusław
Linda.
Another
quote
in
the
Polish
client
is
"Wyrwałem
chwasta"
(
"I
pulled
out
the
weed"
meaning
he
killed
someone
for
being
bad)
is
a
reference
to
the
sequel
of
Psy
said
by
unnamed
character
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
movie.

Twisted
Fate
's
face

them.
Hired
Gun
Graves
skin

a
bear
paw
on
his

which
can
be
a
possible
reference
to

It
also
seems
to
be
a
reference
to
the
game
