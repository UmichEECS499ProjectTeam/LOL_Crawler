Trivia
Heart
of
Gold
paid
for
itself
after
27
minutes
and
30
seconds.
If
it
was
sold,
it
paid
for
itself
after
13
minutes
and
46
seconds.
It
was
the
most
expensive
of
all
gold-generating
items.
The
item's
appearance
as
a
turtle
shell
is
a
reference
to
an
obscure
myth
whereby
gold
or
some
assorted
treasure
can
be
obtained
by
breaking
or
prying
open
the
turtle's
shell.
The
item
was
removed
because
it
allowed
non-support
characters
access
to
free
extra
gold,
as
it
gave
health
and
built
into
items
that
bruisers
could
use
well.
The
Relic
Shield
added
in
Season
4
is
very
similar
to
this
item.
