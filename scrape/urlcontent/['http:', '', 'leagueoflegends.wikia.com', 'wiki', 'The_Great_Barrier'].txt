The
Great
Barrier
is
a
mountain
range
stretching
from
east
to
west
across
Valoran
,
dividing
the
continent
into
two
large
pieces.
Its
most
famous
peak
is
Mount
Targon
,
home
to
Pantheon
,
Leona
,
and
Diana
,
and
the
most
well-known
pass
through
it
is
Mogron
Pass
.
It
is
known
as
the
Great
Barrier
because
it
divides
Valoran
between
north
and
south.
North
of
the
Great
Barrier
stands
most
of
Valoran's
city-states,
while
most
of
what
lies
south
of
the
Great
Barrier
is
wasteland
and
wild
places
with
occasional
ruins
from
Rune
Wars
past.
There
are
many
Minotaur
tribes
that
live
along
the
Great
Barrier,
including
the
one
from
which
Alistar
hails.
