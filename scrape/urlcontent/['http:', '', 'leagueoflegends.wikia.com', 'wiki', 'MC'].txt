The
Magma
Chamber
is
a
2v2
Field
of
Justice
,
played
for
the
first
time
to
showcase
All-Stars
at
the
All-Star
Showdown
in
Shanghai,
China
[1]
.
It
is
based
on
an
old
concept
for
a
5v5
map,
first
announced
on
September
16th
2010
[2]
,
that
was
reworked
into
Dominion
[3]
,
since
then,
it
has
been
cancelled.

of
Magma
Chamber
(concept)
Deep
within
the
obsidian
mountain
from
which
the
Institute
of
War
is
sculpted
lies
the
League’s
most
intense
Field
of
Justice
to
date:
the
Magma
Chamber
.
Before
the
time
of
the
League,
the
Chamber
was
the
heart
of
a
powerful,
but
now
dormant,
volcano.
Ancient
magma
flows
cut
out
a
gigantic
cavernous
room
that
the
League
has
reshaped
for
its
own
purposes.
This
battle
arena
was
built
specifically
to
address
the
increasing
number
of
disputes
between
Demacia
and
Noxus
.
It
is
one
of
the
largest
Fields
of
Justice
found
anywhere
on
Valoran
.
To
that
end,
teleporting
platforms
provide
champions
with
the
ability
to
rapidly
relocate
to
strategic
points
in
the
arena.
The
magic-infused
stone
and
cooled
magma
that
dominates
the
structure
of
the
arena
will
force
champions
to
work
together
more
closely
in
pushing
toward
the
enemy’s
nexus
.
It
will
be
harder
for
a
champion
to
rely
on
their
summoner
to
traverse
hazards
and
obstacles.
The
League
is
preparing
this
Field
of
Justice
to
be
the
premier,
a
slew
of
new
monsters
and
minions
await
champions
in
what
will
surely
be
their
greatest
challenge
yet.

Gameplay
Possible
layout
of
lanes,
monster
camps
and
structures.
The
map
was
optimized
for
5v5
play,
similar
to
the
original
Summoner's
Rift
map,
but
was
intended
to
have
a
different
feel
and
strategic
approach.
Unlike
Summoner’s
Rift,
which
focuses
on
larger
team
fights
in
the
mid
and
late
game,
Magma
Chamber
emphasized
smaller,
more
tactical
fights,
map
awareness
and
victory
in
specific
lanes.
Features
Biggest
of
the
Classic
mode
maps
with
longer
lanes
.
New
monsters
with
different
buffs
.
New
gamestyle
towards
smaller
1v1
and
2v2
fights.
Static
teleportation
pads
for
easier
map
traversing.
Less
gankability.
