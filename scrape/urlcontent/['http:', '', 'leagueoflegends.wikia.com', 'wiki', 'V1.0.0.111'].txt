PVP.net
v1.29.23
Created
a
new
UI
flow
for
joining
games
of
all
types.
Updated
the
Friend
List
UI.
Runes
are
now
stacked
in
the
Summoner
profile.
Co-op
vs.
AI
Announcement
This
mode
was
stated
to
be
released
a
few
days
after
this
patch
went
live,
but
it
was
actually
released
on
March
10th,
several
days
after
the
next
patch.
This
mode
pits
a
team
of
all
human
players
against
a
team
of
all
AI
bots
on
Summoner's
Rift.
This
mode
is
supported
by
matchmaking,
and
allows
summoners
to
join
the
queue
solo
or
with
friends.
Summoners
may
choose
between
two
AI
bot
difficulty
settings:
Beginner
or
Intermediate.
IP
and
XP
rewards
are
earned,
and
adjusted
based
on
summoner
level
and
difficulty
setting.
The
following
bots
are
enabled
for
Co-op
vs.
AI:
Annie
Ashe
Cho'Gath
Miss
Fortune
Nunu
Renekton
Ryze
Shen
Soraka
Taric
Trundle
Warwick
XP
&
IP
Rate
Changes
We
have
completely
overhauled
the
IP
and
XP
system
in
order
to
make
it
more
fair.
Our
intention
was
to
leave
the
overall
XP
and
IP
gained
by
players
unchanged.
Previously,
IP
and
XP
were
awarded
for
winning
or
losing
a
game.
Now,
they
are
granted
based
on
how
long
the
game
was,
and
whether
you
won
or
lost.
In
a
long
game,
you
will
make
significantly
more
XP
and
IP
than
before.
However,
in
a
very
short
game,
you
will
make
less
IP
and
XP.
We
found
it
frustrating
to
be
stuck
in
an
hour
long
games,
and
then
get
what
was
effectively
30
minutes
of
IP
reward.
When
calculating
the
number
of
minutes
the
game
took,
we
only
award
for
actual
game
time.
However,
we
give
all
games
a
small
fixed
bonus
reward,
which
is
to
give
you
credit
for
time
in
queue
and
champion
selection.
Other
details:
We
have
also
tweaked
the
formulas
so
that
new
players
get
larger
quantities
of
IP
in
their
first
10
or
so
levels
so
that
they
can
unlock
their
first
Champions
more
quickly.
First
Win
of
the
Day
remains
unchanged
–
it
is
still
a
flat
bonus
you
will
receive
when
you
are
eligible.
We
removed
the
no-leave-streak
bonus
and
increased
the
IP
rewards
in
general
to
compensate.
The
reason
we
did
this
is
because
we
felt
that
with
the
new
LeaverBuster
system,
this
was
no
longer
necessary.

V1.0.0.111
Champions
Maokai,
the
Twisted
Treant
(
Original
Stats
)
Arcane
Smash
:
Maokai
slams
the
ground,
the
force
of
which
knocks
nearby
enemies
back
and
sends
an
arcane
shockwave
forward,
damaging
and
slowing
his
enemies.
Twisted
Advance
:
Maokai
dissolves
into
a
cloud
of
arcane
energies.
He
regrows
near
a
target
enemy,
dealing
damage
and
rooting
it
in
place.
Sapling
Toss
:
Maokai
hurls
a
sapling,
dealing
damage
on
impact.
The
sapling
becomes
implanted
in
the
ground,
warding
a
nearby
area.
When
enemies
approach,
the
sapling
attacks,
exploding
in
an
arcane
blast
that
damages
enemies.
Vengeful
Maelstrom
(Ultimate):
Maokai
shields
his
allies
by
drawing
power
from
hostile
spells
and
attacks,
reducing
non-tower
damage
done
to
allied
champions
in
the
area.
Maokai
can
prolong
the
effect
as
long
as
he
has
mana
to
spend
on
it.
When
the
effect
ends,
Maokai
unleashes
the
absorbed
energy
to
deal
damage
to
enemies
within
the
vortex.
Sap
Magic
(Innate):
Each
time
a
champion
near
Maokai
casts
a
spell,
he
gains
a
charge
of
Magical
Sap.
When
he
has
5
charges,
Maokai's
next
melee
attack
drains
energy
from
his
target,
healing
him
for
a
percentage
of
his
maximum
health.
Akali
Fixed
a
bug
where
the
sound
of
Mark
of
the
Assassin
could
persist
after
her
target
died.

damage
increased
to

per
second
reduced
to
8
from
10
at
all

It
now
has
a
new
particle
to
match
the
area
of
effect.
Anivia
Glacial
Storm
:
Initial
mana
cost
increased
to
100/150/200
from
25/35/45.
Mana

per
second
reduced
to
40/50/60
from
50/70/90.
Slow

reduced
to
1
second
from
2.5.

Armor
and
magic
resistance
modifier
changed
to
-40
/
-25
/
-10
/
+5
/
+20
from
-40
/
-20
/

.
It
now
always
shows
the
passive
in
the
passive
slot,
and
an
additional
buff
in
the
buff
bar
with
the
current
status
(ready,
active,

properly
assigns
assist
markers
to
allies

spell
shields
and

a

would

seconds
from
1.3
seconds.
Grand
Skyfall
now
has
a
small
area
near
the
center
that

full
damage
(previously
it
was
impossible
to
deal
full
damage
to
any
target).
Rammus
Powerball
speed
reduced
by
about
15%.
Renekton

Summoners!
We’re
taking
a
short
break
from
the
regularly
scheduled
Patch
Preview
video
series,
but
we
will
definitely
be
resuming
the
series
with
some
improvements
in
the
near
future!
Still,
we
wanted
to
give
you
a
preview
of
what
the
upcoming
patch
will
bring
to
League
of
Legends.
It’s
important
to
note
that
this
preview
doesn’t
reflect
all
of
the
changes
coming
with
this
update,
but
it
does
address
the
larger
items.
Survivability
and
Items
For
this
patch,
we’re
taking
a
look
at
survivability
items
that
provide
a
ton
of
cooldown
reduction.
Due
to
the
higher
base
damages
of
bruiser-style
characters,
this
combination
of
CDR
and
damage
mitigation
was
particularly
powerful.
We
ultimately
found
that
many
items
had
excessively
inexpensive
CDR.
With
this
in
mind,
we
took
a
swipe
at
Spirit
Visage,
Frozen
Heart,
Glacial
Shroud
and
Soul
Shroud
to
bring
these
values
more
in
line.
This
isn’t
the
only
change
to
tanky
DPS
that
we
have
in
mind,
and
you
can
expect
more
comprehensive
adjustments
for
a
future
patch.
Champions
Changes
Vladimir
remains
a
problematic
champion
who
--
while
not
explicitly
overpowered
--
nullifies
a
lot
of
meaningful
interactions
between
players
and
tends
to
snowball
more
heavily
than
others
due
to
the
gold
value
multiplier
of
his
passive.
We
reduced
this
value,
along
with
making
Sanguine
Pool
a
little
less
of
a
“get-out-of-gank-free”
card,
while
retaining
its
anti-focus-fire
mechanic.
This
included
some
long-awaited
bug-fixes
to
Sanguine
Pool,
which
should
affect
his
pre-level
6
tower
diving.
Also,
while
we’d
done
some
smaller
nerfs
to
Rammus
over
the
last
couple
patches,
we
decided
to
hit
the
speed
on
powerball
by
15%
in
order
to
make
his
chase/CC
combination
a
little
bit
less
of
a
sure
thing.
We’ll
be
keeping
an
eye
on
this
change
over
the
course
of
the
patch,
and
evaluating
it
to
see
if
this
has
the
intended
impact.
Anivia’s
lane
harass
was
proving
too
easy
to
pull
off
for
too
high
of
a
reward.
To
address
this,
we
increased
the
mana
cost
of
pulsing
(quickly
activating
and
deactivating)
Glacial
Storm
and
lessening
the
slow
duration.
This
will
reward
leaving
it
down
longer
a
little
more,
but
make
her
R-to-E
lane
harassment
less
of
a
free-be.
Ryze:
A
Legend
Reborn
Finally,
we
took
time
to
give
Ryze
a
needed
overhaul,
updating
his
design
to
make
his
gameplay
more
unique.
Ryze
has
always
had
a
ton
of
burst
damage
potential,
along
with
a
repeatable,
single-target.
However
even
with
a
very
powerful
ultimate
and
a
substantial
amount
of
AoE
damage
he
wasn’t
reliable
enough
as
a
champion.
Players
didn’t
have
an
incentive
to
select
Ryze
when
alternatives
such
as
Annie
have
a
stronger
upfront
burst.
With
Ryze
we
decided
to
attempt
a
new
type
of
champion
design:
a
ranged,
caster-carry.
We
worked
to
turn
him
into
a
champion
that
dished
out
sustained
DPS
and
has
a
powercurve
similar
to
a
standard
ranged
physical
carry.
In
essence,
Ryze
would
become
the
Ashe
of
magic.
In
order
to
achieve
this,
we
started
by
dropping
the
base
damage
of
Ryze’s
spells
across
the
board.
To
compensate,
we
added
scaling
along
a
stat
that
increases
with
each
level
(in
this
case
mana),
since
champions
don’t
gain
ability
power
with
level.
Next,
we
reduced
his
cooldowns
significantly,
turning
him
into
a
sort
of
spell
machine
gun.
Finally,
we
increased
the
range
on
his
abilities
in
order
to
give
him
better
options
for
kiting
strategy.
Ultimately,
we
wanted
to
create
a
character
that
would
thrill
those
players
looking
for
a
high
skill-cap
champion
with
an
active,
fast-paced
play
style.
See
you
next
time!
