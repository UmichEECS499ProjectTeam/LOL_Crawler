With
each
arrow
she
fires
from
her
ancient
ice-enchanted
bow,
Ashe
proves
she
is
a
master
archer.
She
chooses
each
target
carefully,
waits
for
the
right
moment,
and
then
strikes
with
power
and
precision.
It
is
with
this
same
vision
and
focus
that
she
pursues
her
goal
of
uniting
the
tribes
of
the
Freljord
and
forging
them
into
a
mighty
nation.
As
a
child,
Ashe
was
always
a
dreamer.
She
marveled
at
the
colossal,
abandoned
fortresses
of
her
ancestors,
and
spent
hours
by
the
fire
listening
to
tales
of
the
Freljord's
fabled
champions.
Most
of
all
she
loved
the
legend
of
Avarosa,
the
renowned
Queen
of
the
once
magnificent
and
united
Freljord.
Though
her
mother
chided
her
foolishness,
Ashe
swore
one
day
she
would
join
the
scattered
and
warlike
tribes
of
the
tundra.
She
knew
in
her
heart
that
if
her
people
would
stand
together
once
more,
they
would
reach
greatness
again.
When
Ashe
was
only
fifteen,
her
mother
was
killed
while
commanding
the
tribe
on
a
brash
raid.
Suddenly
thrust
into
the
role
of
leader,
Ashe
made
the
difficult
decision
to
follow
her
childhood
vision
instead
of
seeking
the
revenge
she
craved.
She
spoke
passionately
against
her
tribe's
demand
for
retribution,
declaring
the
time
had
come
to
put
blood
feuds
aside
and
broker
a
lasting
peace.
Some
of
her
warriors
questioned
her
fitness
to
rule
and
soon
hatched
a
treasonous
plot
to
kill
the
young
leader.
The
assassins
struck
while
Ashe
was
on
a
routine
hunt,
but
their
plan
was
interrupted
by
the
warning
cry
of
a
great
hawk.
Ashe
looked
back
to
see
her
tribesmen
approaching
with
swords
drawn.
Outnumbered
and
overwhelmed,
Ashe
ran
for
hours.
She
found
herself
deep
in
uncharted
territory,
her
weapon
lost
in
the
chase.
When
she
heard
another
cry
from
the
hawk,
Ashe
put
her
faith
in
the
strange
creature
and
followed
it
to
a
clearing.
There
she
found
the
bird
perched
on
a
pile
of
stones
-
an
ancient
Freljord
burial
cairn.
With
a
last
glance
at
her,
the
hawk
screeched
and
flew
away.
Approaching
the
mound,
Ashe
felt
her
breath
turn
to
frost
and
an
unnatural
cold
chill
her
to
the
bone.
The
stone
at
the
top
of
the
cairn
was
marked
with
a
single
rune:
Avarosa.
The
assassins
burst
into
the
clearing.
Ashe
lifted
the
runestone
from
the
cairn
to
defend
herself,
revealing
something
hidden
underneath:
an
ornate
bow
carved
from
ice.
She
grasped
it,
crying
out
in
pain
as
frost
formed
on
her
fingers,
and
tore
the
bow
from
its
resting
place.
Cold
flowed
from
the
enchanted
weapon
into
Ashe,
awakening
a
tremendous
power
that
had
always
lived
within
her.
Ashe
turned
to
face
the
assassins.
She
drew
the
bow,
and
by
sheer
instinct,
willed
arrows
of
pure
ice
to
form
from
the
cold,
crisp
air.
With
a
single
frozen
volley,
she
ended
the
insurrection.
Carefully
replacing
the
cairn
stone,
she
gave
thanks
to
Avarosa
for
her
gift,
and
returned
home.
Ashe's
tribe
immediately
recognized
the
legendary
weapon
in
the
archer's
hand
as
a
blessing
from
the
ancient
Freljord
queen
herself.
With
Avarosa's
bow
and
her
vision
of
peaceful
unification,
Ashe's
tribe
soon
swelled,
becoming
the
largest
in
the
Freljord.
Now
known
as
the
Avarosan,
they
stand
together
with
the
belief
that
a
united
Freljord
will
once
again
become
a
great
nation.
"One
tribe,
one
people,
one
Freljord."
―
Ashe
One
of
the
perennial
favorites
of
summoners
in
the
League
of
Legends
is
the
Freljordian
beauty
known
as
Ashe.
She
is
a
direct
descendant
of
Avarosa
-
one
of
three
legendary
sisters
who
each
claimed
dominion
over
the
scattered
tribes
dwelling
in
the
icy
tundra
of
northern
Valoran
.
Ashe
mirrors
her
ancestor's
unparalleled
mastery
of
the
bow,
earning
her
the
title
of
"The
Frost
Archer"
the
way
Avarosa
did
during
her
era.
Ashe
is
a
literal
Princess
amongst
her
people,
though
she
prefers
to
be
addressed
by
outsiders
as
her
tribal
title
rather
than
any
form
of
royal
moniker.
There
are
those
in
Freljord,
however,
that
would
prefer
to
address
Ashe
as
the
late
Frost
Archer;
the
other
two
tribes
that
are
descendants
from
the
Three
Sisters
are
historically
sworn
enemies
of
Ashe
and
her
people.
Having
survived
more
than
one
assassination
attempt
in
her
life,
Ashe
is
always
aware
of
her
surroundings
regardless
of
where
she
is.
Ashe
originally
came
to
the
Institute
of
War
in
service
of
the
League
summoners
,
seeking
enough
influence
and
favor
to
finally
bring
peace
to
her
realm
-
one
that
has
endured
civil
strife
since
Avarosa
and
the
Time
of
the
Three
Sisters.
With
countless
victories
under
her
belt,
she
has
started
to
put
the
influence
she
has
earned
in
the
League
to
use.
Rumors
abound
that
Ashe
has
begun
to
associate
herself
with
fellow
champion
Tryndamere
outside
of
the
Fields
of
Justice.
While
she
denies
such
talk
as
frivolous,
all
eyes
will
remain
on
Ashe
now
that
her
success
in
the
League
may
finally
allow
her
to
restore
lasting
peace
to
her
people.
"It's
a
good
idea
to
spread
out.
Ashe
can
hit
five
birds
with
one
arrow."
―
Tryndamere
"It
is
our
duty
to
speak
of
unity,
here
among
the
ruins
of
our
past.
Now
our
people
stand
divided,
torn
apart
by
ancient
hatreds.
Brothers
and
sisters,
our
enemy
is
not
our
neighbor.
Our
enemy
is
a
land
without
law
and
a
long
winter's
night.
It
is
hunger,
poverty,
desperation
and
chaos.
Look
around
you,
these
monuments
from
a
bygone
age,
each
older
and
grander
than
anything
wrought
by
our
hands.
These
are
the
works
of
a
united
Freljord,
a
fractured
land
that
we
can
repair.
From
these
ruins,
we
can
raise
a
great
nation.
We
are
the
people
of
the
Freljord,
and
this
land
belongs
to
us
all."

Battle
On
The
Tundra
Main
article:
Freljord
The
Freljord
is
home
to
many
vicious
ice
storms,
but
none
compare
to
the
Gelid
Vortex
-
a
swirling,
icy
maelstrom
which
circles
the
northern
hemisphere.
Ashe
was
leading
a
squadron
of
elite
archers,
her
closest
companions,
when
they
found
themselves
caught
in
this
wintery
nightmare
at
the
end
of
a
week-long
standoff
with
a
warring
tribe.
When
she
came
to,
Ashe
was
surrounded
by
the
tattered
corpses
of
friends
and
enemies
alike.
Only
divine
providence
had
spared
her
from
the
whirling
shards
of
ice,
and
her
hair
had
turned
the
color
of
the
arctic
tundra.
Ashe
never
again
wore
the
traditional
Freljord
White
Garments
of
Victory.
