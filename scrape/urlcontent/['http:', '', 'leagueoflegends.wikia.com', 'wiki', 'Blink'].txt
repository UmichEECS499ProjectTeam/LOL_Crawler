You
can
help
the
League
of
Legends
Wiki
by
casting
Wild
Growth
on
it
so
it
isn't
as
small
as
a
yordle.
These
abilities
target
a
point
or
unit
and
instantaneously
teleport
the
champion
to
the
target
location,
usually
causing
an
effect
afterwards.
These
are
unique
from
the
dash
abilities
because
they
avoid
all
hazards
between
the
points
and
are
therefore
not
affected
by
them.
For
example,
Ahri
gets
stunned
when
using
Spirit
Rush
through
Veigar's
Event
Horizon
but
Kassadin
can
Riftwalk
past
with
impunity.
Jumping
over
walls
is
possible
with
blinks.
However,
when
targetting
inside
environments
i.e.
trees
and
walls,
location-targeted
blinks
will
move
the
champion
to
the
closest
available
area
instead,
which
may
result
in
a
successful
maneuver
or
a
waste
of
an
ability.
This
gives
many
champions
a
valuable
advantage.
