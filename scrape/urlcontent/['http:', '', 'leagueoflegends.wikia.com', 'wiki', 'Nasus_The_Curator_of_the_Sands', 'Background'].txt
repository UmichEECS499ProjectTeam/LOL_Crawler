The
enigmatic
creature
known
as
Nasus
came
to
the
League
from
a
faraway
world,
and
served
as
part
of
a
vast
and
learned
desert
empire.
There
he
was
a
respected
and
enlightened
individual,
having
been
made
the
Keeper
of
the
Great
Library.
However,
he
was
also
part
of
a
race
of
animalistic
creatures
that
served
as
the
rulers
and
protectors
of
the
people.
Unfortunately,
there
were
others
of
his
kind
that
believed
they
were
more
than
protectors.
They
were
under
the
egotistical
delusion
that
they
had
ascended
to
become
gods.
War
on
Nasus's
world
was
never
more
than
a
breath
away,
as
these
deluded
others
sought
to
enslave
the
people
and
establish
a
totalitarian
sovereignty.
In
the
midst
of
a
heated
battle,
just
as
Nasus
was
about
to
slay
his
treacherous
brother
Renekton
,
he
was
pulled
through
the
cosmos
to
a
summoning
circle
in
Runeterra
.
At
first
angered
that
he
had
been
taken
just
as
he
was
about
to
cripple
the
enemies
of
his
people,
Nasus'
advanced
intellect
won
out
when
he
heard
the
pleas
for
mercy
from
the
summoners
.
He
learned
that
Runeterra
was
also
filled
with
its
own
brand
of
injustice.
This
danger
was
no
less
threatening
than
what
he
had
fought
against
at
home,
and
champions
were
needed
to
protect
the
people
of
this
world.
Heeding
the
call,
Nasus
chose
to
take
his
place
in
the
League
of
Legends,
knowing
that
his
brothers
and
sisters
would
carry
on
the
fight
back
home.
These
days,
he
is
the
Curator
of
the
Sands,
feeling
most
at
home
in
the
crumbling
ruins
of
the
Shurima
Desert
.
However,
recent
disturbing
news
has
reached
the
Keeper's
ears
-
rumors
that
perhaps
his
brother
had
not
in
fact
been
left
behind.
If
this
were
the
case,
the
destruction
of
Renekton
would
quickly
become
Nasus'
main
priority,
before
this
world
to
faces
the
threats
of
his
brother's
forked-tongue
and
endless
ambition.
"The
Curator
of
the
Sands,
though
contemplative,
is
not
to
be
trifled
with."
The
enigmatic
creature
known

Nasus

just
as
Nasus

about
to
slay
his
treacherous

Renekton
,
he
was
summoned
to
Runeterra
.
It
didn't
take
much
to
convince
him
that
Champions
were
needed
to
fight
against
the
injustice
here
and
he
took
up
a
place
in
the
League
of
Legends.
These
days,
he
is
the
Keeper
of
the
Sands,
feeling
most

in

of

Nasus,
the
Curator
of

Announcement
made
by
RiotWenceslaus
:
[1]
As
the
scholar-warrior
raises
his
halberd,
the
sun
glints
off
the
blade
just
before
the
Siphoning
Strike
comes
crashing
down.
Nasus
stands
guardian
anew,
the
sand
shaken
from
his
armor,
his
visual
update
complete.
Each
of
his
abilities
is
accompanied
by
new
animations
and
particles,
completely
updating
the
vision
of
Nasus.
Fury
of
the
Sands
is
accompanied
by
a
ferocious
roar,
intimidating
particles
and
a
darkened
emblem
of
his
homeland.
All
of
the
Curator's
skins
have
been
studiously
renewed
as
well.
His
spirit
aflame
and
renewed,
Nasus
casts
a
withering
pall
over
his
enemies,
ensuring
that
the
cycle
of
life
and
death
continues.

Here
falls
the
shadow
of
despair.A
dark
symbol
sears
the
ground
beneath
his
victim,
burning
everything
within.
Infernal
Nasus
is
on
the
hunt.
Dark,
shadowy
hands
encircle
his
quarry,
choking
their
movement
as
if
immersed
in
sludge.
There
is
no
escape.
"Here
falls
the
shadow
of
despair."
―
Infernal
Nasus
He
stands
above
his
prey,
a
legend
come
alive
and
growls,
"I
am
death."
Infernal
Nasus’s
pauldrons
break
free
with
exultant
howls
as
flames
ignite
the
fury
of
the
sands.
Death
would
be
preferable
to
what
comes
next.
"This
is
the
way
your
world
ends."

With

a
unique
second
form
during
his
ultimate,
Infernal
Nasus
is
the
new,
darker
legendary
skin
for
the
Curator
of
the
Sands.
From
a
dark,
twisted
vision
of
the
world,
Infernal
Nasus
howls
with
feral
power.
Siphoning
Strike
echoes
with
a
malevolent
glow
upon
his
halberd,
while
Wither
summons
shadows
to
clutch
and
grasp
his
quarry.
When
he
calls
forth
Spirit
Fire
the
ground
blazes
with
black
flame.
With
his
prey
already
cowering,
his
rage
ignites
the
Fury
of
the
Sands.
Infernal
Nasus
towers
over
his
foe,
three
maws
spouting
fire.
His
passing
leaves
nothing
but
dust.
