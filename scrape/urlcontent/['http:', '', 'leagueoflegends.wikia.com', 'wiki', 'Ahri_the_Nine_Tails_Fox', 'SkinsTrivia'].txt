Trivia
Ahri
is
inspired
by
the
Nine-tailed
fox
-
a
mythological
being
originating
from
East
Asia,
and
has
become
a
recurring
creature
in
modern
fantasy.
Ahri
was
designed
by
Ezreal
,
although
Coronach
helped
him
develop
her
kit.
[3]
There
were
several
different
names
for
the
Nine-Tailed
Fox
throughout
development:
Ezreal
himself
referred
to
the
Nine-Tails
as
Gumiho
(구미호).
[4]
The
more
common
name
Kumiho
is
a
direct
reference
to
the
Nine-tailed
fox
from
Korean
mythology
.
A
player
found
a
poll
for
her
name
on
the
Riot
Korea
webpage,
[5]
which
gave
6
different
options
to
vote
for:
Danbi
(단비)
(meaning
Saviour
or
Saving
Rain
)
Nabi
(나비)
(meaning
Butterfly
)
Ruri
(루리)
(meaning
Dazzle
)
Ari
(아리)
(meaning
Graceful
or
Elegant
)
Chorong
(초롱)
(meaning
Glittering
)
Dasom
(다솜)
(meaning
Loving
).
Ahri
is
voiced
by
Laura
Post.
Ahri
was
simultaneously
released
(on
all
servers)
with
the
launch
of
the
Korean
servers.
Ahri's
dance
is
based
on
the
choreography
for
the
song
Run
Devil
Run
by
Girls'
Generation
(소녀시대;
So
Nyeo
Shi
Dae/SNSD),
an
extremely
popular
Korean
girl
group.
A
side-by-side
comparison
can
be
seen
here
.
Interestingly
enough,
this
girl
group
consists
out
of
nine
members,
which
could
be
a
reference
to
Ahri's
title
(the
Nine-Tailed
Fox).
Essence
Theft
,
previously
shared
its
name
with
Nasus'
passive
-
Soul
Eater
.
The
name
was
changed
in
a
minor
patch
shortly
after
her
release.
In
the
Champion
Spotlight,
Phreak
refers
to
her
passive
as
"Soul
Eater".
Ahri's
final
design
has
fox
ears,
whereas
her
original
design
did
not.
Her
clothes
were
also
changed.
Her
title
on
the
League
of
Legends
site
is
displayed
as
"the
9
Tails
Fox",
[6]
while
in-game
and
spotlight
are
both
"the
Nine-Tailed
Fox".
The
latter
title
is
grammatically
correct.
This
has
been
fixed
on
the
website.
Skins
Ahri's
hairstyle
in
her
main
skin
is
a
fish
tailed
braid.
She
shares
this
trait
with
Lissandra
.
Dynasty
Ahri
is
wearing
modernized
Hanbok
(traditional
Korean
clothing).
Additionally,
this
skin
changes
her
dance
to
a
traditional
Korean
dance.
Foxfire
Ahri
is
a
reference
to
the
Mozilla
Firefox
browser
as
she
bears
the
same
color
scheme
of
the
browser's
icon
in
her
splash
art
background.
Foxfire
Ahri
shares
the
internet
browser
theme
with
Explorer
Ezreal
,
Chrome
Rammus
,
and
Safari
Caitlyn
.
Popstar
Ahri
is
a
reference
to
the
Korean
Pop
group,
Girls'
Generation
.
Her
outfit,
splash
art
background,
dance,
and
recall
animations
bear
similarity
to
their
2009
single,
"Genie".
The
skin
was
announced
on
November
5th,
2013,
which
coincided
with
Girls'
Generation
's
release
of
their
single,
"My
Oh
My".
A
side-by-side
comparison
can
be
seen
here
.
This
is
Ahri's
first
splash
art
in
which
her
Orb
of
Deception
is
not
displayed.
Relations
Some
sources
hint
Ahri
having
a
friendship
with
Wukong
.
This
is
confirmed
by
the
League
of
Legends
website.
