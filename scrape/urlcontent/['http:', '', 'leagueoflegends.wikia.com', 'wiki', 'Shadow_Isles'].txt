Lore
The
Twisted
Treeline
Little
is
known
about
the
mysterious
Shadow
Isles.
An
eternally
thick,
unnatural
fog
blankets
the
islands
from
the
view
of
outsiders.
It
is
thought
that
the
islands
are
home
to
countless
forms
of
undead,
though
no
one
seems
eager
to
perform
the
exploration
necessary
to
find
out
the
truth.
A
year
after
the
League
was
established,
summoners
were
sent
to
explore
a
small
portion
of
the
isle
and
later,
established
the
Twisted
Treeline
.
Most
of
the
Shadow
Isles'
history
comes
from
the
two
mysterious
altars
of
the
Twisted
Treeline,
that
says
fragments
of
their
history
to
its
capturers
and
from
the
League
records
of
the
Shadow
Isles'
champions.
Creatures
of
the
Shadow
Elise
in
the
spider
god's
cavern
In
the
Isles,
there
are
many
shades
of
death,
and
each
is
embraced
rather
than
feared
or
reviled.
One
can
only
ascend
from
one
state
to
the
next
with
the
magical
aid
of
a
skilled
professional.
Yorick,
the
Gravedigger
,
is
one
individual
who
serves
this
role.
He
acts
as
a
ferryman
for
the
Isles'
undead
denizens,
helping
them
climb
death's
many-tiered
ladder.
Another
being
is
the
feared
lich,
Karthus,
the
Deathsinger
.
Evelynn,
the
Widowmaker
,
is
also
a
creature
believed
to
have
originated
from
the
Shadow
Isles.
It
is
clear
upon
first
meeting
her,
and
surviving,
that
she
is
not
quite
human.
Some
theorize
that
she
was
cursed
with
a
mild
form
of
fantastical
vampirism
as
a
child.
Supporters
of
this
theory
contend
that
her
ability
to
sap
the
very
life
essence
of
her
opponents
on
(and
off)
the
Fields
of
Justice
,
while
still
being
able
to
tolerate
direct
sunlight,
would
account
for
this
belief.
Another
popular
theory
is
that
she
abused
the
use
of
magic
as
a
child,
morphing
her
into
the
hungering
beast
her
opponents
see
on
the
battlefield.
Elise,
the
Spider
Queen
is
a
another
being
that
worships
the
Spider
God,
Vilemaw
[1]
,
that
made
its
den
in
a
cave
in
the
Shadow
Isles.
Every
year
she
would
return
to
the
Isles
with
a
select
few
of
her
disciples
and
travel
to
her
spider's
den,
transform
into
her
true,
hybrid
form
and
feed
her
followers
to
it.
Afterwards
she
would
extract
the
venom
of
the
spider
and
drink
it
to
retain
her
youth.
She
would
again
return
to
Valoran
in
her
human
form
to
preach
of
her
deity
and
take
them
again
to
its
lair
by
the
end
of
the
year.
Thresh,
the
Chain
Warden
is
yet
another
creature
with
ties
to
the
Isles.
Legends
speak
of
a
prison
warden
with
a
fondness
for
torture,
whose
preferred
tools
were
chains.
It's
not
surprising
that
such
a
monster's
spirit
would
come
back,
armed
with
the
chains.
His
sole
purpose
is
finding
worthy
souls,
breaking
the
minds
and
bodies
of
their
hosts,
and
then
carrying
them
back
to
the
Shadow
Isles,
where
an
unknown
(but
most
likely
terrible)
fate
awaits
them.

"The
Shadow
Isles.
.
.
They
say
they
don't
exist.
Mythical
islands
haunted
by
ghosts
and
spectres.
Tales
to
frighten
children.
But
I
know
better.
I
have
been
there.
When
I
first
set
foot
there
I
immediately
knew
something
was
wrong
with
that
place.
My
skin
crawled
and
in
the
pit
of
my
stomach
I
felt
a
terrible
revulsion.
Life
didn't
belong
there.
But
I
also
knew...
somehow,
deep
inside
I
knew
that
the
islands
welcomed
me.
They
wanted
me.
"As
I
wandered
deeper
I
saw
death
all
around
me.
Ghostly
trees,
grass
and
flowers
engulfed
me
in
their
horrifying
radiance.
It
was
so
quiet
and
so
beautiful.
I
passed
my
hand
through
a
spectral
leaf
fluttering
in
the
wind;
but
there
was
no
wind.
That
was
when
I
understood
that
death
was
another
world
and
I
was
at
its
door.
"Then
I
heard
the
song;
the
spider's
song.
My
companion
cried
out
in
terror
and
fell
to
his
knees.
I
embraced
him.
I
told
him
he
had
nothing
to
fear.
He
was
going
to
a
better
place.
I
will
take
them
all
to
a
better
place."
―
Elise
On
the
Shadow
Isles,
there
is
a
saying,
"Death
is
but
a
new
beginning."
"As
the
fog
parted
and
I
first
beheld
the
Shadow
Isles,
I
sensed
immediately
that
something
was
amiss.
From
the
mysteriously
placid
waters
of
the
bay
to
the
dead
calm
of
the
night
air,
an
eerie
stillness
gripped
the
place
–
even
the
sea
and
sky.
Even
as
I
made
ready
to
go
ashore,
the
crew
begged
me
to
return
at
once
to
the
mainland."
―
Elise,
the
Spider
Queen
"Despite
its
size,
the
immense
forest
loomed
like
a
sepulcher
around
us,
and
the
dank
air
and
unnatural
stillness
bred
increasing
feelings
of
paranoia
and
dread.
My
companion
begged
me
to
turn
back,
but
some
primal
yearning
spurred
me
onward,
deeper
into
the
gloom."
―
Elise,
the
Spider
Queen
The
quote
of
the
western
altar
,
"This
place
was
once...
so
beautiful."
,
suggests
that
the
Shadow
Isles,
and
all
its
inhabitants,
were
transformed
by
the
Rune
Wars
or
by
some
other
catastrophic
event.
The
altars
on
the
Twisted
Treeline
suggest
:
The
quote
of
the
western
altar
;
"I
serve
you,
because
I
must,
Mordekaiser."
;
and
the
eastern
altar
"I
serve
you
gladly,
Mordekaiser."
,
Mordekaiser
holds
some
rank
in
the
Shadow
Isles,
further
evidenced
by
his
old
lore
which
stated
that
he
was
an
undead
general.
The
quote
of
the
Western
altar
;
"Mordekaiser
is
not
to
be
trusted
Hecarim!"
,
taking
in
count
that
Hecarim
fights
for
the
Shadow
Isles,
Mordekaiser
actual
goals
aren't
linked
to
the
Isles,
but
to
his
personal
benefits.
The
quote
of
the
Western
altar
;
"Are
you
also
a
prisoner
Mordekaiser"
,
likely
means
that
Mordekaiser's
affiliation
to
the
Shadow
Isles
is
forced,
and
he
fights
this
by
following
his
personal
objectives,
not
of
the
Isles.
Apart
from
the
altars,
the
quote
(from
his
old
lore)
"The
common
perception
is
that
the
encompassing
armor
protects
him,
I
fear
that
–
for
the
fragile
time
being
–
it
actually
protects
us."
,
somewhat
confirms
the
Western
Altar
quote,
as
his
armor
might
be
his
prison.
The
quote
of
the
western
altar
;
"Remember
who
you
once
were,
Hecarim."
,
suggests
that
Hecarim
was
once
human,
and
lived
on
the
pre-cataclysmic
Shadow
Isles.
Hecarim
marches
across
Valoran
in
the
name
of
the
Shadow
Isles.
The
quote
of
the
western
altar
;
"For
the
King!"
,
suggests
that
there
is
a
leader
of
the
isles.
The
Twisted
Treeline
was
the
last
living
forest
of
Zaun
but
was
retconned
to
be
a
location
in
the
Shadows
Isles.
There
is
a
popular
theory
that
the
Champions
of
the
Shadow
Isles
represent
the
seven
deadly
sins.

A

At

as
