This
linear
missile
path
indicator
is
a
distinctive
feature
of
nearly
all
skillshots.
A
skillshot
is
a
type
of
champion
ability
that
casts
a
projectile
that
originates
from
a
point
of
cast,
typically
the
casting
champion
,
as
opposed
to
directly
targeting
a
unit.
Circular
area
of
effect
abilities
are
not
considered
skillshots.
Types
of
skillshots
By
targeting
reticle
Among
the
skillshots
in
the
game,
the
majority
of
them
can
be
classified
as
either
Linear
or
Conic.
Linear
skillshots
fire
in
a
straight
line
from
the
casting
champion
while
Conic
skillshots
are
attached
to
the
champion
itself,
and
hit
enemies
in
front
of
the
champion.
Lesser
distributed
among
champions
are
Vector
and
Curved
skillshots.
Vector
skillshots
are
fired
by
clicking
a
point
on
the
map
and
dragging
the
mouse
cursor
over
a
targeted
area.
Curved
skillshots
fire
in
a
curved
arc
from
the
casting
champion.
Currently,
Diana
possesses
the
only
curved
skillshot
in
League
of
Legends
while
Viktor
and
Rumble
are
the
only
champions
with
a
vector
skillshot.
Examples:
Linear
skillshots
:
Blitzcrank's
Rocket
Grab
,
Ezreal's
Mystic
Shot
,
Xerath's
Arcanopulse
Conic
skillshots
:
Heimerdinger's
Hextech
Micro-Rockets
,
Kha'Zix's
Evolved
Spike
Racks
Vector
skillshots
:
Rumble's
The
Equalizer
,
Viktor's
Death
Ray
Curved
skillshots
:
Diana's
Crescent
Strike
Other
classifications
A
skillshot
may
be
considered
a
Colliding
skillshot
if
it
stops
and
affects
only
the
first
target
in
its
path,
a
Pass-through
skillshot
if
it
continues
on
its
trajectory
regardless
of
the
targets
it
passes
through
(Some
colliding
skillshots
have
secondary
area
of
effects
that
occur
once
they
hit
a
target.),
or
a
Boomerang
skillshot
if
when
thrown
it
will
go
a
distance
and
return
back
to
the
champion.
A
Boomerang
skillshot
is
a
skillshot
that
when
fired
it
goes
out
a
certain
distance
and
comes
back
dealing
damage
again.
An
exception
to
this
rule
is
Draven's
Whirling
Death
because
once
it
hits
an
enemy
champion
Draven's
Whirling
Death
will
go
a
bit
farther
and
return
to
Draven
dealing
damage
to
all
enemies
on
its
way
back.
All
current
Boomerang
skillshots
all
reset
their
damage
on
their
way
back,
for
instance
Sivir's
Boomerang
Blade
will
deal
10%
less
damage
to
each
taget
it
hits
after
the
first
enemy
it
hits
on
its
way
out
to
a
cap
of
40%
less
damage.
After
it
rebounds
it
resets
its
damage
and
comes
back.
For
example
an
enemy
behind
5
minions
will
take
40%
reduced
damage
from
Sivir's
Boomerang
Blade
however
when
it
comes
back
around
they
will
take
full
damage.
If
an
enemy
stands
at
full
range
of
the
Boomerang
skillshot's
range
they
will
take
damage
from
it
coming
out
and
returning.
