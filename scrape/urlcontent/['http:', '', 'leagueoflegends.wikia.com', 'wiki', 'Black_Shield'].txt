Ability
Details
Black
Shield
is
an
ally-targeted
single
target
ability.
Additional
Information:
Black
Shield
has
no
cast
time
and
does
not
interrupt
Morgana's
previous
orders.
Black
Shield
is
distinct
from
spell
shields
and
does
not
outright
negate
entire
spells.
If
an
ability
applies
separate
debuffs
for
a
disable
and
a
non-disable
effect,
the
non-disable
effect
will
still
be
applied.
For
example,
the
slow
from
Karthus's
Wall
of
Pain
will
be
negated,
but
the
magic
resistance
reduction
will
not.
Black
Shield's
disable
immunity
is
applied
before
any
damage
is
absorbed.
If
a
spell
applies
crowd
control
yet
also
has
sufficient
power
to
break
the
shield
at
the
same
time,
the
spell's
effects
are
still
negated.
Black
Shield's
magic
damage
shield
will
take
priority
over
normal
shields
and
magic
damage
is
always
applied
to
it
first.
When
used
with
Hexdrinker's
Lifeline
,
the
most
recent
shield
applied
takes
priority.
Black
Shield
does
not
prevent
self-inflicted
disables
such
as
the
silence
from
Rumble's
Junkyard
Titan
or
the
slow
from
Vi's
Vault
Breaker
.
Soul

Range:

Active:
Morgana
latches
chains
of
energy
onto
nearby
enemy
champions
for
3
seconds,
dealing
initial
magic
damage
to
them
after
a
brief
delay
of
0.
5
seconds
and
reducing
their
movement
speed
by
20%
if
the
target(s)
stay
within
1050
range.
If
the
target(s)
does
not
break
the
tether
after
3
seconds,
they
are
dealt
the
same
amount
of
magic
damage
again
and
they
are
also
stunned
for
1.
5
seconds.

Ability
Details
Soul
Shackles
is
a
point
blank
auto-targeted
ability.
Applies
spell
effects
as
an
area
of
effect
ability.
Spell
vamp
is
reduced
to
one-third
effectiveness.
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
will
apply
a
15%
slow.
Magic
damage
will
be
mitigated
by
Black
Shield
and
Lifeline
.
Spell
shields
will
block
the
application
of
the
tether.
They
will
not
block
the
stun
and
damage
from
a
tether
already
applied.
Additional
Information:
If
Soul
Shackles
only
hits
a
single
enemy,
Morgana
will
intermediately
try
to
chase
them
unless
she
is
already
moving
on
the
opposite
direction
to
them.
Morgana
will
not
automatically
chase
if
she
does
not
have
sight
of
her
target
upon
activation
of
the
ability.
Soul
Shackles
can
hit
nearby
stealthed
champions,
but
does
not
grant
sight
of
any
sort.
The
visual
effect
of
the
tether
will
additionally
not
follow
the
target's
movements
as
long
as
they
remain
stealthed.
Soul
Shackles
is
not
a
channeled
ability.
As
such,
crowd
control
will
not
stop
its
effects
and
will
persist
throughout
the
untargetability
of
Zhonya's
Hourglass
.
Soul
Shackles'
effects
will
persist
through
pseudo-death
states
such
as
the
revival
of
Guardian
Angel
and
Zilean's
Chrono
Shift
.
