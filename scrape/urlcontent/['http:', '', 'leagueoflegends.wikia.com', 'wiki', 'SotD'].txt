is
only
gold
efficient—albeit
extremely
so—while
its
active
is
in
effect.
Notes
Attack
damage
-based
champions,
especially
assassins
and
carries
,
can
use
Sword
of
the
Divine
as
a
powerful
situational
steroid.
While
Garen's
Judgment
will
benefit
from
the
100%
critical
strike
chance,
each
critical
strike
will
not
count
toward
the
3-critical-strike
limit.
On
the
contrary,
Parrrley
will
consume
one
of
the
strikes.
As
such,
the
critical
strike
counter
is
consumed
on-hit
rather
than
on-critical-strike.
Even
though
you
cannot
critically
strike
structures,
it
won't
allow
you
to
retain
the
bonus
attack
speed
for
the
full
duration,
it
will
go
off
after
the
third
strike.
Lucian
's
ultimate,
The
Culling
,
will
ignore
the
bonus
attack
speed
from
Sword
of
the
Divine
.
This
is
a
special
case,
"to
prevent
abuse",
and
is
intended
by
Riot.
It,
along
with
Vayne's
Silver
Bolts
and
Runaan's
Hurricane
,
are
the
only
champion-oriented
special
cases
coded
into
items.
