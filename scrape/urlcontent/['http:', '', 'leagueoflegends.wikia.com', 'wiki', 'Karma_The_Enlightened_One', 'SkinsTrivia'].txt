Trivia
Traditional
Karma
is
voiced
by
Danielle
McRae
.
According
to
the
voice
actress,
she
fused
accents
of
Storm
from
X-Men
and
Gaia
from
Captain
Planet
to
create
Traditional
Karma's
voice.
All
of
Karma's
abilities,
except
for
her
first
skill,
have
both
an
offensive
and
a
defensive
component,
accentuating
the
dualism
of
her
character.
The
black
and
white
robes
of
her
Traditional
skin
display
this
as
well,
exhibiting
her
black
and
white
side.
This
being
a
reference
to
Yin
and
Yang
.
Karma
is
one
of
five
champions
to
have
more
than
4
skills,
the
other
being
Nidalee
,
Jayce
,
Elise
and
Lee
Sin
.
Karma,
after
her
rework,
was
the
fifth
champion
to
have
more
than
4
skills.
Karma
is
the
first
champion
to
feature
an
art
spotlight
even
before
her
official
arrival.
The
name
Karma
and
the
title
"The
Enlightened
One"
are
related
to
Buddha
,
which
is
Sanskrit
for
"enlightened
one".
The
doctrine
of
karma
,
the
effects
good
or
bad
actions
have
on
a
person,
is
prominent
in
Buddhist,
Hindu,
Jain
and
Sikh
beliefs.
Apart
from
the
changes
made
to
her
overall
voice
the
3
quotes
she
said
when
activating
her
ultimate,
Mantra
remain
the
same
as
in
her
old
voiceover
and
on
her
Traditional
Skin
Karma
is
possibly
based
off
Indian
backgrounds
because
her
ultimate
Mantra
is
also
a
naturally
occurring
force
that
means
"creation
of
the
mind"
in
the
Indian
beliefs.
Also
her
name
"
Karma
"
literally
means
"what
goes
around
comes
around"
(similar
to
Yin
and
Yang
in
Chinese)
in
Indian
language.
Karma
used
to
be
the
only
champion
whose
three
main
abilities
had
six
ranks
and
who
lacked
an
upgradable
ultimate
skill.
Karma's
old
passive
was
a
rework
of
Ryze's
old
passive,
Desperate
Power
.
Karma's
old
auto-attack
range
(425)
was
the
shortest
of
all
champions
classified
as
ranged.
She
shared
this
trait
with
Urgot
and
Morgana
.
Traditional
Karma
keeps
her
old
voice
over
after
her
rework,
while
her
Classic,
Sun
Goddess,
and
Sakura
skins
have
her
new
voice
over.
Karma
is
the
first
champion
to
have
both
redesign
and
relaunch
after
their
release.
The
first
champion
to
technically
have
a
redesign
was
Lee
Sin
however,
this
was
before
his
launch
and
release.
Karma
is
the
fourth
champion
to
feature
two
champion
spotlights
due
to
significant
changes
to
her
kit
and
aesthetics,
the
others
being
Ezreal
,
Lee
Sin
and
Sivir
.
Quotes
Traditional
Karma's
quotes,
"Onward
always"
,
"To
conquer
oneself
is
to
conquer
all"
,
"Peace
begins
within"
and
"I
interrupted
my
meditation
for
this?"
,
all
have
connection
to
Buddhist
beliefs.
Traditional
Karma's
joke
"Guess
what's
about
to
hit
the
fan"
is
a
reference
to
the
saying
"the
sh*t
hits
the
fan"
meaning
that
something
is
about
to
change
radically,
like
a
situation
escalating.
It
is
also
a
pun
on
the
fact
that
she
wields
fans
as
weapons.
Karma
shares
a
quote
with
Syndra
:
"By
force
of
will"
.
Karma's
joke
is
a
double
entendre
.
It
refers
to
the
fact
where
her
kit
makes
it
rather
easy
to
catch
up
to
an
opponent.
The
other
is
about
karma
,
where
your
deeds
will
always
be
done
to
you
in
due
time.
Karma's
quote
"I
have
seen
two
paths,
and
made
another
between"
is
likely
a
reference
to
the
Buddhist
belief
of
the
"Middle
Way".
Karma
uses
a
quote
(
"If
you
desire
peace,
you
must
prepare
for
war!")
based
on
a
latin
saying
"Si
vis
pacem,
para
bellum",
which
means
"If
you
want
peace,
prepare
for
war".
This
also
refers
to
her
Background.
Skins
When
dancing,
Karma
uses
a
pair
of
fans
except
for
her
classic
skin.
This
is
a
tribute
to
her
original
model
where
she
used
fans
as
her
main
weapon.
Karma
is
the
second
Ionian
female,
after
Irelia
,
whose
clothing
includes
Ionia's
"Mantle
of
Decorum",
a
large
metallic
circular
decoration
floating
behind
her
head.
It
is
Ionia's
highest
decoration.
Karma's
Mantle
of
Decorum
is
the
symbol
of
Ionia.
It
can
also
be
seen
in
the
background
of
Traditional
Karma
'
s
splash
art
and
as
Sakura
Karma's
Mantle
of
Decorum.
Sakura
Karma
depicts
her
in
a
Japanese
geisha
theme.
Sakura
is
the
Japanese
term
for
ornamental
cherry
blossom
trees
and
their
blossoms.
It
is
an
omen
of
good
fortune
and
emblem
of
love.
The
symbol
repeated
on
the
fans
of
the
splash
art
is
the
symbol
of
the
Pax
Cultura
.
Sun
Goddess
Karma
presents
her
in
a
Mesoamerica
n
theme.
Relationships
Karma
is
an
Elder
of
Ionia
,
along
with
Irelia
.
Being
an
elder,
she
is
in
conflict
with
Syndra
.
She
is
a
close
friend
of
Soraka
and
Lee
Sin
.
