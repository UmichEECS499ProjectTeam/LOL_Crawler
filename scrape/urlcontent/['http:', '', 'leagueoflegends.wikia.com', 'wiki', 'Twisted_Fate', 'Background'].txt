Champion
Although
born
to
poor
gypsy
parents,
the
champion
known
as
Twisted
Fate
was
able
to
gamble
his
way
to
prosperity
as
a
card
shark
in
the
seedy
underground
gambling
circuits
of
Demacia
and
Noxus
.
No
matter
how
close
the
authorities
came
to
catching
him,
the
rogue
always
found
a
way
to
slip
through
their
fingers.
Despite
his
good
fortune,
he
was
never
able
to
win
that
which
he
truly
desired
-
the
ability
to
control
magic.
When
Twisted
Fate
learned
of
an
experiment
being
conducted
in
Zaun
that
might
help
him
with
his
wish,
he
did
the
only
thing
a
gambler
of
his
worth
could
do
-
he
went
all
in
and
volunteered
for
the
experiment.
Conducted
by
the
infamous
Dr.
Xavier
Rath,
Twisted
Fate
was
told
that
the
wager
for
such
participation
might
be
steep.
He
might
change
forever,
or
nothing
might
happen,
or
he
might
die
horribly.
Pain,
however,
was
likely
a
part
of
the
deal
no
matter
the
outcome.
These
were
hardly
the
worst
odds
the
gambler
had
faced;
his
hopes
raised,
Twisted
Fate
underwent
the
experiment,
enduring
what
he
must
for
a
chance
at
his
dream.
Then,
it
ended
-
with
seemingly
no
effect
whatsoever.
The
gypsy
rogue
flew
into
a
murderous
rage,
but,
before
he
could
strike
down
the
team,
he
suddenly
teleported
himself
miles
away.
With
a
sly
grin,
he
realized
his
luck
had
won
out
yet
again.
He
now
brings
his
luck
and
rakish
charm
to
the
Institute
of
War
,
where
he
is
the
champion
of
choice
for
many
-
especially
the
gambling
kind.
To
this
day,
Twisted
Fate
has
avoided
his
inevitable
reunion
with
Dr.
Rath.
The
Card
Master
knows,
however,
that
a
confrontation
is
coming.
"While
the
future
may
be
mysterious
and
unknown
to
most,
Twisted
Fate
is
certain
that
his
future
lies
within
the
cards."
The
banks
of
the
Serpentine
River
are
home
to
a
smattering
of
gypsy
communities.
On
any
given
day,
you
can
see
a
flotilla
of
paddleboats
migrating
up
and
down
the
rushing
waters.
Though
their
homes
are
constantly
on
the
move,
their
communities
are
very
stable.
The
Serpentine
gypsies
live
and
die
by
a
single
code:
If
you
are
my
friend,
you
are
my
family.
If
you
are
my
foe,
you
have
made
enemies
of
us
all.
The
most
famous
of
these
gypsies
is
a
man
known
only
as
Twisted
Fate.
In
cards,
no
matter
what
hand
he
is
dealt,
he
always
finds
a
way
to
come
out
on
top.
But
it
isn't
just
his
luck
that
makes
him
so
famous.
Just
ask
anyone
who
has
accused
him
of
cheating.
They'll
tell
you
he
can
kill
a
man
dead
at
twenty
paces—with
nothing
more
than
a
playing
card.
