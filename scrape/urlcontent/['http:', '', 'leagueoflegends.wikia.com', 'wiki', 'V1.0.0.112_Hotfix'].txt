Hotfix
A
hotfix
for

patch
went
live
on
the
9th
of
March,
with
the
aim
of
reducing
the
current
minions
pushing
power
[1]
.
The
hotfix

the
following
changes:
Minions:
Cannon

now
spawn
every
2
waves
after
35
minutes
instead
of
20.
Cannon
minions
and

reduce

damage
by
50%
(down
from
65%).
Minions
now
deal
50%
more
damage
to
turrets,
down
from
60%.
After
the
hotfix,
the
minions
changes
introduced
in
this
patch
are
the
following:
Minions:
Minions
now
deal
50%
more
damage
to
turrets
(up
from
40%).
Melee
minion
magic
resist
now
increases
1.25
per
3
minutes
(up
from
0.5).
Ranged
minion
armor
now
increases
1.25
per
3
minutes
(up
from
0.5).
Cannon
minion
armor
and
magic
resist
now
increase
3
per
3
minutes
(up
from
2).
After
35
minutes,
cannon

waves
(up
from
every
3
waves).
Fixed
a
tooltip
bug
"This
unit
receive..."
with
cannon
minions
and
super
minions.
Undocumented
Changes
General
Change
to
slow
stacking.
The
most
potent
slow
you
put
on
a
target
always
slows
for
the
amount
stated
(full
effect).
Slows
beyond
the
highest
%
slow
still
stack
multiplicatively
but
are
cut
in
half.
Previously,
diminishing
returns
for
slows
kicked
in
at
a
certain
number,
which
meant
that
the
first
slow
applied
may
have
been
hitting
diminishing
returns
and
slowing
for
less
than
intended.
In
general
single
slows
will
be
as
strong
or
stronger
than
before
and
multiple
slows
should
be
weaker
than
before.
