Vayne,

Night
Hunter
is
a
champion
in
League
of
Legends
.
[1]
Abilities
Night
Hunter
Range:
2000
Vayne
gains
30
movement
speed
when
moving
towards
a
visible
enemy
champion.
Ability
Details
Night
Hunter
is
a
passive
ability
that
activates
whenever
Vayne
is
facing
a
visible
enemy
champion,
granting
her
a
flat
amount
of
additional
movement
speed
.
Additional
Information:
Vayne
does
not
need
to
be
moving
to
gain
the
movement
speed
bonus.
This
can
affect
the
strength
of
movement
speed
buffs
or
debuffs.
Enemy
champions
that
are
not
visible
to
Vayne
(through
Fog
of
War
,
brush
,
or
stealth
)
will
not
activate
Night
Hunter.
PENDING
FOR
TEST
Night
Hunter's
bonus
movement
speed
persists
for
a
short
duration
after
Vayne
loses
sight
of
an
enemy.

Vayne
quickly
rolls
toward
the
cursor's
location,
causing
her
next
basic
attack
within
6
seconds
to
deal
bonus
damage.
This
ability
resets
the
autoattack
timer
on
cast.

Ability
Details
Tumble
is
a
cursor
targeted
linear
dash
and
autoattack
modifier
ability.
The
triggering
attack
will
apply
other
on-hit
effects
and
can
critically
strike
as
normal.
Like
most
onhit
physical
damage,
the
bonus
damage
from
Tumble
will
apply
life
steal
.
Critical
strikes
do
not
interact
with
Tumble's
bonus
damage.
The
enhanced
attack
does
not
trigger
against
structures.
Probable
Bug:
The
triggering
attack
will
deal
damage
and
apply
on-hit
efects
through
blind.
PENDING
FOR
TEST
Tumble's
bonus
damage
interaction
with
dodge
,
block
and
parry
has
yet
to
be
tested.
Spell
shields
will
not
block
the
empowered
autoattack.
Additional
Information:
Tumble
resets
Vayne's
attack
timer
on
cast.
However,
due
to
the
cast
time
of
the
ability,
this
can
potentially
result
in
an
actual
decrease
in
DPS
if
Vayne
has
sufficient
attack
speed.
Tumble's
cooldown
will
not
start
until
after
the
autoattack
modifier
is
used
or
expires
after
6
seconds.
Tumble
cannot
move
Vayne
over
impassible
terrain,
but
it
does
allow
her
to
pass
through
minions
and
monsters.
Temporary
terrain
such
as
Crystallize
and
Cataclysm
can
be
moved
over
if
Tumble
can
completely
pass
over
it.
Tumble
can
be
used
to
dodge
Ashe's
Enchanted
Crystal
Arrow
.
Not
only
can
she
avoid
it
by
diving
to
the
side,
but
also
by
diving
towards
it.
This
most
often
results
in
Vayne
being
slowed,
not
stunned,
and
only
taking
the
arrow's
AoE
damage.
If
timed
perfectly,
the
Enchanted
Crystal
Arrow
will
completely
pass
through
Vayne.
Silver
Bolts
Passive:
Consecutive
attacks
and
abilities
mark
Vayne's
target
with
silver
rings.
The
third
consecutive
attack
or
spell
against
the
same
target
will
consume
the
rings,
dealing
true
damage
equal
to
a
flat
amount
plus
a
percentage
of
the
target's
maximum
health
(capped
at
200
against
monsters).
The
rings
are
removed
if
Vayne
attacks
a
different
target
or
doesn't
attack
for
3
seconds.

Ability
Details
Silver
Bolts
is
a
passive
ability
that
grants
Vayne
an
on-hit
effect
.
Vayne's
autoattacks
and
Condemn
ability
apply
a
debuff
on
the
target
unit
for
3
seconds.
Does
not
apply
spell
effects
.
True
damage
ignores
all
forms
of
damage
reduction,
except
invulnerability
.
Spell
shields
will
not
block
the
damage.
Additional
Information:
If
Vayne
autoattacks
or
uses
Condemn
on
a
different
enemy
unit
than
her
previous
target,
all
Silver
Bolt
stacks
are
removed.
Silver
Bolts
is
the
only
onhit
effect
specifically
coded
to
not
function
with
Runaan's
Hurricane
,
as
it
can
only
be
applied
to
one
target
at
a
time,
and
otherwise
Vayne
would
be
unable
to
trigger
the
ability
at
all
when
hitting
multiple
targets.

Ability
Details
Condemn
is
a
single
targeted
ability
that
fires
a
crossbow
bolt
at
a
target
enemy
unit,
dealing
physical
damage
on
impact
and
knocking
them
back
a
set
distance
over
0.5
seconds.
Applies
spell
effects
as
a
single
target
ability.
Spell
vamp
is
fully
applied.
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
will
apply
a
35%
slow.
Spell
shields
will
block
the
ability.
Additional
Information:
Using
Condemn
on
champions
that
apply
suppression
such
as
Warwick
or
Malzahar
is
inconsistent.
It
has
been
seen
on
occasion
to
completely
interrupt
the
suppression,
however
there
have
been
instances
where
the
enemy
is
simply
moved
but
the
suppression
continues,
even
if
he
was
moved
out
of
the
ability's
range
(e.g.
Warwick
using
Infinite
Duress
outside
of
melee
range).
Unlike
most
abilities,
Condemn
uses
a
similar
mechanic
to
basic
attacks
when
conducting
range
calculations
-
it
takes
into
account
the
hitboxes
of
the
target
unit.
For
most
champions
this
means
an
additional
range
of
about
100
units
(more
pronounced
for
larger
units)
and
ensures
that
Vayne
can
always
Condemn
if
she
is
capable
of
basic
attacking
a
target.
Condemn
only
takes
into
account
natural
impassable
terrain
for
the
purposes
of
its
stun
-
it
will
ignore
player-created
terrain
such
as
Anivia's
Crystallize
,
Jarvan
IV's
Cataclysm
and
Trundle's
Pillar
of
Filth
and
will
simply
push
targets
through
them
when
used.

Ability
Details
Final
Hour
is
a
self-buff
ability.
Additional
Information:
Final
Hour
has
no
cast
time
and
does
not
interrupt
Vayne's
previous
orders.
Stealth
is
entered
immediately
upon
beginning
Tumble's
dash.
Any
action
other
than
movement
will
bring
Vayne
out
of
stealth.
Vayne's
animations
and
her
autoattack
projectiles
change
slightly
while
Final
Hour
is
active.
