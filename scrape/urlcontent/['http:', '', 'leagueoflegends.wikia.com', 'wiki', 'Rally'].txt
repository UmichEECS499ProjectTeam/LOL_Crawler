Example
Rally
was
a
summoner
spell
that
was
removed
in
patch
V1.0.0.129
.
It

by
10-35
for
15
seconds.

Strategy
Rally
could
be
used
to
temporarily
increase
the
damage
output
of
your
nearby
team
members,
as
well
as
provide
an
extra
target
to
grab
attention
from
turrets
.
Notes
It
could
be
targeted
by
targeted
dash
abilities
such
as
Lee
Sin's
Safeguard
.
It
could
be
pushed
out
of
place
by
knockup
and
knockback
abilities
.
It
affected
all
allied
units
such
as
minions
and
Heimerdinger's
H-28G
Evolution
Turret
.
Trivia
Unlike
wards
it
could
not
be
placed
in
a
selected
location,
but
it
would
be
summoned
directly
in
front
of
the
direction
your
champion
is
facing.
