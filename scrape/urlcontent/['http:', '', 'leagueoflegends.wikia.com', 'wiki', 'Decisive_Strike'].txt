Ability
Details
Decisive
Strike
is
a
self-
buff
,
on-hit
effect
ability.
The
triggering
attack
will
apply
other
on-hit
effects
and
can
critically
strike
as
normal.
As
with
most
on-hit
physical
damage,
the
bonus
damage
from
Decisive
Strike
will
apply
life
steal
.
Critical
strikes
will
not
interact
with
Decisive
Strike's
base
damage
or
bonus
40%
AD
ratio.
The
bonus
damage
will
affect
structures.
The
entire
damage
will
go
through
dodge
.
The
entire
damage
will
be
mitigated
if
Garen's
attack
is
blocked
or
parried
.
Decisive
Strike's
empowerment
will
be
consumed
if
the
attack
misses
.
In
all
3
cases
listed
above
the
target
will
still
be
silenced.
Spell
shields
will
block
the
enhanced
autoattack.
Additional
Information:
Decisive
Strike
has
no
cast
time
and
does
not
interrupt
Garen's
previous
orders.
Decisive
Strike
will
reset
Garen's
attack
timer
on
cast.
Decisive
Strike's
on-hit
effect
and
movement
speed
buff
are
independent.
Using
the
enhanced
autoattack
will
not
remove
the
movement
speed
buff.

for

Ability
Details
Courage
is
a
self-
buff
that
passively
also
provides
a
buff
.
Additional
Information:
Courage
has
no
cast
time
and
does
not
interrupt
Garen's
previous
orders.
Courage's
passive
benefits
are
not
lost
while
the
ability
is
on
cooldown.
Courage's
passive
bonuses
are
calculated
after
armor
and
magic
resistance
reductions
are
taken
into
account.
If
the
value
of
bonus
resistance
is
inferior
to
the
amount
reduced,
Garen
will
be
considered
as
having
no
bonus
resistances
and
will
therefore
not
get
any
resistances
from
Courage's
passive.
Courage's
damage
reduction
does
not
affect
true
damage
.

Ability
Details
Judgment
is
a
point
blank
area
of
effect
ability.
Applies
spell
effects
as
an
area
of
effect
ability.
Spell
vamp
is
reduced
to
one-third
effectiveness.
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
will
apply
a
15%
slow.
Spell
shields
will
not
block
the
ability.
Additional
Information:
While
Judgment
is
active,
Garen
cannot
use
basic
attacks,
but
may
still
move
and
use
his
other
champion
abilities,
summoner
spells
and
item
actives.
Although
Garen
will
benefit
from
Decisive
Strike's
slow
removal
and
movement
speed
boost,
he
cannot
apply
its
autoattack
modifier
since
Garen
cannot
attack
while
Judgment
is
active.
Garen
may
cast
Demacian
Justice
while
Judgment
is
active
-
however,
he
will
cancel
the
ability
to
do
so.
Judgment
is
not
a
channeled
ability.
As
such,
crowd
control
will
not
stop
its
effects.
Silences
will,
however,
prevent
Garen
from
deactivating
the
ability
early.
Judgment
can
critically
strike
,
but
only
the
AD
ratio
damage
portion
of
the
ability
will
be
affected
by
a
crit.
Judgment
is
subject
to
a
flat
critical
strike
damage
penalty
of
50%
for
a
total
critical
strike
ratio
of
150%
(normally
200%).
An
Infinity
Edge
,
for
example,
would
increase
this
to
200%
(normally
250%).
Although
Judgment
lasts
for
3
seconds,
the
first
tick
of
damage
occurs
as
soon
as
the
ability
is
cast,
with
5
more
ticks
of
damage
occuring
every
half
second
afterward.
As
a
result,
the
last
0.5
seconds
of
the
ability
deals
no
damage.
If
other
sources
of
anti-collision
(such
as
Ghost
or
Phantom
Dancer
)
are
affecting
Garen
as
he
uses
Judgment,
they
will
override
its
unit
collision
and
will
no
longer
cause
him
to
be
slowed
when
pathing
through
units.
