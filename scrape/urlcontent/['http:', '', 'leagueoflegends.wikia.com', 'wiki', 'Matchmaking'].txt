Matchmaking
is
the
existing
automated
process
in
League
of
Legends
that
matches
a
player
to
and
against
other
players
in
games.

Details
The
system
estimates
how
good
a
player
is
based
on
whom
the
player
beats
and
to
whom
the
player
loses.
It
tries
to
make
matches
where
it
thinks
a
player
has
a
50/50
chance
of
winning.
It
knows
pre-made
teams
are
an
advantage,
so
it
gives
pre-made
teams
tougher
opponents
than
if
each
player
had
queued
alone
(or
other
premades
of
a
similar
total
skill
level).
Riot
Games
uses
some
formulas
in
an
attempt
to
make
the
pre-made
teams
vs
solo
players
matching
fair.
The
basic
concept
is
that
the
system
over
time
understands
how
strong
of
a
player
you
are,
and
attempts
to
place
you
in
games
with
people
of
the
same
strength.
As
much
as
possible,
the
game
tries
to
create
matches
that
are
a
coin
flip
between
players
who
are
about
the
same
skill.
The
basic
priorities
of
the
system
are,
in
order
of
importance:
Protecting
new
players
from
experienced
ones.
Fairness
&
creating
competitive
matches.
Finding
a
match
at
all.
The
longer
you
wait,
the
more
important
this
priority
is.
There
are
three
steps
on
that
the
matchmaking
system
follows:
1:
Determine
the
player's
strength
If
solo
queued,
it’s
just
based
on
personal
rating
(i.e.
ranked
team
rating
for
ranked
team,
normal
games
rating
for
normal
games).
If
it's
a
pre-made
team,
the
rating
is
the
average
of
the
team
members,
along
with
an
increase
based
on
the
type
of
pre-made
to
make
sure
that
the
team
gets
tougher
opponents,
because
being
a
pre-made
is
an
advantage.
2:
Determine
eligible
opponents
Initially,
the
system
will
only
match
you
with
very
similar
players
based
on
the
rating
you
have
been
assigned.
Eventually,
it
gives
you
less
ideal
matches
because
it
doesn't
want
you
to
be
in
line
forever.
New
players
get
special
protection
to
increase
the
likelihood
of
being
matched
with
and
against
other
new
players.
3:
Find
a
match
Eventually,
the
system
finds
a
match
that
is
deemed
"fair"
for
everyone
involved,
and
puts
the
players
into
a
game.
The
system
then
tries
to
balance
the
team
to
make
two
teams
with
50%
odds
of
winning.
In
our
mid-beta
pool,
which
has
very
few
players
relative
to
what
is
in
release,
the
majority
of
games
created
by
the
system
had
teams
predicted
to
be
extremely
fair
(no
team
with
odds
greater
than
55%
to
win).
We
expect
that
in
release,
that
98%+
of
the
time
we
will
see
games
where
no
team
is
thought
by
the
system
to
have
a
higher
than
55%
chance
to
win.
This
is
because
adding
a
small
amount
of
players
to
the
system
dramatically
improves
the
quality
of
matches
made,
and
we
expect
a
lot
more
people
to
be
playing
at
release
than
in
closed
beta...
Elo
System
The
Matchmaking
System
works
along
with
a
modified
version
of
the
Elo
system.
The
basic
gist
of
the
Elo
system
is
that
it
uses
math
to
compare
two
player
ratings
to
guess
the
game
result
–
like,
"Player
A
will
win
vs
Player
B
75%
of
the
time".
From
there,
the
game
is
played.
If
a
player
wins,
the
player
gain
points.
On
the
contrary,
if
the
player
loses,
he
loses
points.
If
the
win
was
"unexpected"
(i.e.
the
system
expects
you
to
lose),
the
points
you
gain
are
larger.
[1]
The
system
was
modified
for
team
use,
and
basically,
the
concept
is
that
a
player
gets
a
team
Elo
based
on
whoever
is
on
the
team,
and
if
the
player
wins,
it
is
assumed
that
everyone
on
the
team
was
“better”
than
the
guess,
and
gains
points.
There
are
some
problems
with
this,
but
it
generally
works
out,
especially
if
people
use
pre-mades
a
little
bit.
The
System
do
a
few
little
things
to
nudge
the
Elo
rating
in
the
right
direction
when
you
start
out
so
that
people
get
where
they
need
to
get
faster.
Various
proprietary
methods
to
identify
players
that
are
significantly
more
skilled
than
a
new
player,
and
boot
their
rating
up
a
bunch
behind
the
scenes
when
we
notice
this.
Gaining
levels
boosts
a
player's
Elo
rating
a
lot.
This
further
helps
separate
level
30
summoners
from
low
level
summoners.
Additionally,
newer
players
gain
and
lose
points
more
rapidly
so
that
they
are
able
to
play
in
their
skill
level
faster.
Over
time,
this
means
that
good
players
end
up
high
rated
because
they
do
better
than
the
system
expects,
until
the
system
is
guessing
correctly
how
often
they
will
win.
