Revive
Effect
Instantly
revives
your

which
decays

seconds.

Example
Revive
is
a
self-targeting
Summoner
spell
that
instantly
respawns
a
dead
champion
at
their
home
base
and
gives
them
a
large
speed
boost
that
slowly
decays
over
a
set
duration.
Accordingly,
this
spell
is
usable
only
while
the
summoner's
champion
is
dead.
Revive
can
be
used
in
all
game
modes
with
the
exception
of
Howling
Abyss
.

Strategy
When
game
pressures
become
tense,
Revive's
sudden
burst
of
recovery
from
the
grave
can
turn
the
tide
of
battle
in
all
but
hopeless
situations.
Similarly,
this
spike
of
champion
presence
can
be
used
to
seize
an
opportunity
that
might
otherwise
be
out
of
reach.
Revive's
speed
boost
allows
players
to
quickly
intercept
any
objective
close
to
their
home
base,
including
an
ongoing
fight.
This
effect
is
even
more
prominent
on
smaller
maps
like
Twisted
Treeline
,
where
even
objectives
on
the
opposing
side
of
the
map
become
easy
to
approach.
Indeed,
Revive's
long-distance
mobility
as
a
summoner
spell
is
rivaled
only
by
Summoner
Teleport
.
The
bonus
health
granted
from
Revive's
companion
mastery,
Summoner's
Insight
,
brings
added
weight
to
a
champion's
return,
especially
when
coupled
with
champion
roles
that
benefit
particularly
from
health,
e.g.
fighters,
tanks,
and
aggressive
assassins.
In
later
game
phases,
longer
death
timers
increase
the
impact
of
Revive
even
further.
For
example,
if
a
late-game
team
fight
ends
with
multiple
players
on
both
sides
slain,
a
revived
champion
can
attack
objectives
that
the
opposing
team,
now
suffering
from
death
recovery,
can
not
defend
or
counterattack
against.
Notes
Revive
synergizes
well
with
champions
that
have
an
'on-death'
effect
such
as
Karthus
and
Kog'Maw
.
Note
that
a
champion
under
the
effect
of
an
on-death
ability
is
considered
alive
until
the
ability
ends;
only
after
entering
into
death
does
Revive
become
usable.
Other
movement
speed
and
mobility
effects
can
be
combined
with
Revive
,
allowing
players
to
traverse
even
greater
distances
with
breakneck
speed
and
initiative.
The
boots
enchantment
Homeguard
pairs
exceedingly
well
with
Revive
,
as
a
revived
player
will
almost
always
trigger
Homeguard's
otherwise
uncommon
condition
-
being
at
the
summoner's
platform.
Trivia
Revive
was
removed
from
the
Ultra
Rapid
Fire
special
April
Fools
game
mode
in
2014.
At
9
minutes,
Revive
has
the
longest
cooldown
of
any
spell
or
ability
in
League
of
Legends.
This
cooldown
is
one
of
the
longest
timed
effects
in
the
entirety
of
the
game,
second
only
to
Baron
Nashor's
initial
spawn
timer
of
15
minutes
on
Summoner's
Rift.
