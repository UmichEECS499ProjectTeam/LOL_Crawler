Ability
Details
Death
Ray
is
a
vector-targeted,
linear,
pass-through
skill
shot
.
Applies
spell
effects
as
an
area
of
effect
ability.
Spell
vamp
is
reduced
to
one-third
effectiveness.
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
will
apply
a
15%

Magic
damage
will
be

.
Spell
shields
will
block
the
ability.
Additional
Information:
The
damage
over
time
can
be
removed
with
Quicksilver
.
Death
Ray
has
no
cast
time
and
Viktor
may
freely
act
while
the
ray
is
travelling.
Sight
is
granted
in
a
medium
area
around
the
beam
while
it
travels.
Although
this
vision
will
not
go
through
bushes
or
across
walls,
it
will
reveal
all
champions
within
its
radius
even
if
they
are
hiding
in
a
bush
or
are
across
a
wall.
There
is
a
known
graphical
bug
in
which
the
beam
visual-effect
is
stuck
on
the
place
in
which
it
was
originally
cast,
but
the
damaging
part
of
the
ability
performs
normally,
damaging
units
in
the
intended
location.
If
Viktor
dies
while
he
is
firing
the
beam
it
will
become
interrupted
and
deal
damage
up
to
the
location
where
it
was
in
the
moment
Viktor
died.
The
augmented
damage
over
time
is
unaffected
by
this
if
it
has
already
been
applied.

firing
lightning
bolts
at
every
nearby
enemy
every
second.
While
the
storm
is
active
Viktor
can
re-activate
Chaos
Storm
to
move

Ability
Details
Chaos
Storm
is
a
ground
targeted
area
of
effect
ability
that
damages
and
silences
.
It
then
becomes
a
controllable
entity
that
deals
area
of
effect
damage.
Applies
spell
effects
as
an
area
of
effect
ability.
Spell
vamp
is
reduced
to
one-third
effectiveness.
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
will
apply
a
15%
slow.
Magic
damage
will
be
mitigated
by
Black
Shield
and
Lifeline
.
Spell
shields
will
block
the
activation
of
the
ability
or
an
individual
lightning
bolt.
Additional
Information:
Chaos
Storm
can
be
controlled
by
Alt
+
Right-Click
or
by
pressing
the
R
button
(
default
hotkeys
).
It
can
be
commanded
to
move
toward
locations
or
enemy
champions
(
it
will
continue
to
follow
the
chosen
enemy
champion
unless
commanded
otherwise
).
If
Viktor
is
affected
by
hard-CC
he
cannot
issue
new
commands
to
the
storm.
If
the
champion
the
storm
is
currently
following
enters
stealth
,
the
storm
will
continue
to
follow
them,
effectively
giving
away
their
position.
The
storm
grants
sight
around
its
position
for
the
full
duration.
Including
the
initial
damage,
Chaos
Storm
deals
8
instance
of
damage.
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
will
apply
a
15%
slow
on
each
instance
of
damage
dealt.
Chaos
Storm
remains
active
and
continues
to
deal
damage
if
Viktor
dies
before
the
storm
ends.
When
Viktor
dies,
the
storm
immediately
stops
moving
and
cannot
be
subsequently
redirected.
Probable
Bug:
If
Chaos
Storm
is
summoned
in
a
brush
where
the
enemy
has
no
vision,
it
will
remain
invisible
to
the
enemy
team
for
its
duration
even
if
it
is
redirected
out
of
the
bush.
This
may
be
a
bug.
Aside
from
when
the
bug
occurs,
the
Chaos
Storm
will
be
visible
to
enemies
for
its
duration
even
if
it
enters
a
brush
or
the
fog
of
war.
