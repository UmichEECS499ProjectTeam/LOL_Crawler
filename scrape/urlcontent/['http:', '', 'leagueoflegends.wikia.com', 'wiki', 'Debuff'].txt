A
debuff
is
the
inverse
of
a
buff
.
It
is
an
effect
that
hampers
the
target
in
some
way
for
a
duration.
Among
other
effects,
debuffs
usually
lower
attributes,
hinder
the
effectiveness
of
the
target's
actions,
or
cause
damage
over
time
.
Similarly
with
buff
,
certain
debuffs
are
stackable:
repeated
application
on
the
same
target
will
cause
a
stacking
effect
of
increased
effectiveness.
Non-stackable
debuffs
will
only
be
refreshed
by
repeated
application.
All
debuffs
are
temporary,
and
will
not
persist
after
the
affected
target's
death.
There
are
currently
3
sources
of
debuffs:
champion
abilities,
summoner
spells
,
and
item
effects.
