Lore
Ravaged
by
Rune
Wars
long
past,
the
Shurima
was
wrecked
by
chaotic
magical
storms
leaving
a
harsh
desolate
desert.
The
region
is
known
for
its
hot
climate
where
many
have
been
known
to
go
mad
beneath
the
glare
of
the
Shurima
sun.
Besides
humans,
Armordillos
are
one
of
the
few
known
creatures
that
are
capable
of
surviving
on
its
difficult
terrain.
Culture
Shurima
was
once
a
great
and
mighty
civilization.
The
denizens
of
the
kingdom
skillfully
crafted
enormous
sandstone
walls
and
statues
that
rose
from
the
floor
to
the
ceiling.
The
regal
figures
clasped
scepters
to
their
chests,
and
their
eyes,
plated
in
gold,
would
gaze
eternally
down
upon
those
below
them.
The
kingdom's
most
renowned
structure
was
the
Temple
of
the
Falcon,
where
all
the
mages
of
Shurima
practiced
their
craft.
Young
magicians
would
spar
beneath
their
Magic
ancestors.
They
threw
fire
and
ice
and
twisted
magic
into
the
shapes
of
blades,
honing
the
arcane
into
weaponry.
Such
was
the
charge
of
mages:
the
greatest
masters
of
magic
would
stand
victorious
over
Shurima's
conquered
foes.
For
their
lessons,
the
mages
were
taught
that
magic
was
chaotic,
and
without
a
mage's
guiding
hand,
the
arcane
would
bring
destruction
to
everything
around
them.
As
eons
passed,
the
great
kingdom
of
Shurima
rose
and
fell.
Ruins
were
all
that
remain.
It
is
within
these
crumbling
structures
that
the
enigmatic
creature
Nasus,
the
Curator
of
the
Sands
,
feels
most
at
home.
Not
much
is
known
about
the
present
day
denizens
of
the
Shurima
Desert.
For
centuries
the
inhabitants
have
given
birth
to
many
Seers
who
were
blessed
with
the
gift
of
foresight.
Currently,
the
Seer
that
is
said
to
have
the
most
power
and
potential
is
Malzahar,
the
Prophet
of
the
Void
.
The
Floating
Pyramids
Large
pyramids
can
be
found
floating
in
the
sky
above
the
Shurima
Desert.
The
origins
of
these
structures
is
steeped
in
mystery
and
entering
them
is
said
to
be
extremely
dangerous.
However,
there
are
those
who
believe
that
the
pyramids
house
untold
treasures.
Whether
for
profit,
knowledge,
or
simply
for
the
thrill,
many
adventurers
make
the
attempt
to
discover
the
pyramids'
secrets.
While
exploring
one
of
these
pyramids
the
adventurer
Ezreal,
the
Prodigal
Explorer
,
uncovered
an
ancient
artifact
-
an
amulet
of
inestimable
power.
He
barely
managed
to
extract
it
from
its
sandy
abode
due
to
its
sheer
magnitude
(it
was
made
for
a
being
easily
twice
Ezreal's
size).
After
fervent
investigation,
he
found
that
the
amulet
allowed
the
wielder
to
control
and
shape
magical
energy
-
provided
there
was
a
source
of
magic
nearby.
This
has
permitted
Ezreal
to
tap
into
his
latent
magical
abilities
with
minimal
effort.
For
some
unknown
reason
the
amulet
was
highly
attuned
to
summoning
magic.
The
yordle
known
as
Amumu,
the
Sad
Mummy
,
awoke
alone
inside
another
of
these
pyramids.
How
he
came
to
be
there
remains
unknown...
especially
to
Amumu
himself.
He
was
entwined
in
mummy
wrappings
and
he
could
not
feel
his
heart
beat.
Though
most
assuredly
undead,
he
harbored
none
of
the
evil
characteristics
typical
of
undead
beings.
Furthermore,
he
felt
a
deep
sadness
that
he
could
not
entirely
explain;
he
knew
he
missed
his
parents,
though
he
could
not
remember
who
they
were.
Dropping
to
his
knees,
Amumu
wept
into
his
bandages.
No
matter
what
he
did,
it
seemed
he
could
never
stop
his
tears
or
sadness.
Eventually
he
stood
up,
determined
to
wander
the
world
to
discover
his
past.
History
The
Xerath
Calamity
In
the
ancient
civilization
of
Shurima,
an
ambitious
mage
practiced
magic
with
undying
passion.
He
believed
that
with
enough
magical
power,
he
could
gaze
into
the
heart
of
Runeterra
to
know
the
secrets
of
history
and
the
universe
beyond.
Such
magic
was
beyond
the
limitations
of
a
mortal
body,
but
he
obsessively
pursued
a
path
to
infinite
power
nonetheless.
With
every
breakthrough
he
grew
more
and
more
powerful,
yet
not
without
consequence.
His
increasing
arcane
abilities
wrought
havoc
on
his
physical
form.
Desperate,
he
undertook
a
dangerous
ritual
to
transcend
his
dying
body.
The
outcome
would
be
immortality
or
self-destruction.
Violent
magic
unleashed
during
the
ritual
caused
devastation
throughout
Shurima,
but
when
the
dust
settled,
Xerath,
the
Magus
Ascendant
,
emerged
as
a
being
of
pure
arcane
energy.
Free
of
flesh
and
bone,
Xerath
held
nearly
infinite
power
at
his
command.
However,
in
the
wake
of
his
chaotic
ritual,
the
mages
of
Shurima
feared
his
careless
disregard
for
life
would
bring
ruin
to
the
kingdom.
After
a
terrible
struggle
they
subdued
Xerath,
but
they
could
not
destroy
his
ascended
form.
Instead
they
trapped
him
within
an
enchanted
sarcophagus
and
sealed
him
in
an
underground
tomb.
As
eons
passed,
the
Shurima
civilization
rose
and
fell,
and
Xerath's
imprisonment
was
lost
to
memory.
The
Amulet
Discovered
Ezreal,
the
Prodigal
Explorer
Piltover's
Grandmaster
Explorer,
Ezreal
,
discovered
a
powerful
relic.
An
amulet
of
immeasurable
power,
it
was
clear
that
it
was
made
for
a
being
that
was
easily
twice
his
own
size.
It
had
the
incredible
ability
to
grant
it's
wielder
the
ability
to
control
magic,
provided
that
there
be
a
source
of
power
nearby.
The
Return
of
Xerath
Xerath,
the
Magus
Ascendant
For
centuries,
Xerath's
vast
power
tore
away
at
the
sarcophagus
and
weakened
its
spell.
Finally,
he
willed
forth
a
burst
of
magic
that
shattered
his
prison,
but
its
core
remained,
containing
Xerath
and
his
power
within
its
broken
pieces.
Seeking
to
rid
himself
of
this
burden,
he
was
drawn
to
the
magic
of
Valoran
's
nexuses
and
found
he
could
absorb
their
power.
Yet
the
nexuses
had
gatekeepers:
mages
known
as
summoners
.
Xerath
knew
his
key
to
true
freedom
from
his
prison
lay
in
gaining
their
trust,
and
he
offered
his
power
to
the
League
of
Legends
.
