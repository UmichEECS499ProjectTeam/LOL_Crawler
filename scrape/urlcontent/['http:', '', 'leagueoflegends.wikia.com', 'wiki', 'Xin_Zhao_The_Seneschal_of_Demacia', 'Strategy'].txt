Battle
Cry's
passive
heals
Xin
Zhao
every
three
attacks,
allowing
him
to
sustain
himself
in
lane
for
a
while
by
autoattacking
minion
waves
and
turrets
.
Doing
so
for
extended
periods
however
will
push
your
lane,
so
watch
out
for
gank
attempts.
You
can
reduce
Crescent
Sweep's
cooldown
faster
by
spamming
Three
Talon
Strike
.
However
do
take
care
of
the
mana
cost
early
game,
as
you
can
easily
run
out
of
mana
for
a
fight
by
continuously
spamming
Three
Talon
Strike
too
much.
Three
Talon
Strike
resets
the
attack
timer,
so
getting
one
basic
attack
off,
then
using
the
ability
will
yield
a
greater
DPS.
The
attack
speed
granted
by
Battle
Cry
is
great
for
taking
down
turrets
and
minion
waves,
whilst
also
being
extremely
effective
while
jungling.
One
should
always
have
at
least
one
point
in
Battle
Cry
early
for
the
health
restoration
and
attack
speed
.
Audacious
Charge
does
magic
damage
and
slows
enemies
surrounding
the
target;
you
can
use
that
to
your
advantage
by
charging
a
nearby
enemy
in
order
to
slow
another
just
outside
its
range.
This
ability
will
also
pop
Banshee's
Veil
(or
similar
spell
shields)
on
any
of
the
affected
targets
which
is
extremely
useful
if
your
team
has
an
incoming
area
of
effect
disable.
Bear
in
mind
that
if
you
use
this
tactic
to
jump
to
a
priority
target
with
Banshee's
Veil
,
you
will
want
to
auto-attack
them
at
least
once
before
using
Crescent
Sweep
in
order
to
apply
the
Challenge
debuff
so
that
they
aren't
knocked
away
from
you.
Try
using
Crescent
Sweep
where
it
will
hit
the
most
enemy
champions
.
It
will
not
only
deal
more
damage,
but
greatly
increase
the
armor
and
magic
resistance
bonus.
Xin
Zhao
is
a
great
initiator.
Lunge
at
a
target
with
Audacious
Charge
and
use
Crescent
Sweep
to
do
the
most
damage
possible.
If
you
can
cast
it
while
in
the
midst
of
the
enemy
team,
it
will
also
grant
Xin
Zhao
a
large
amount
of
armor
and
magic
resistance
to
survive
in
the
fray.
To
further
increase
the
effectiveness
of
the
initiation,
try
and
aim
your
attacks
specifically
at
a
high
value
target
such
as
the
opposing
carry
before
using
Crescent
Sweep
as
this
will
cause
them
to
be
Challenged
,
reducing
their
armor
,
separating
them
from
their
teammates
and
marking
them
for
your
allies.
Xin
Zhao
is
an
formidable
ambush
ganker.
Battle
Cry
and
Three
Talon
Strike
make
it
very
hard
to
immediately
escape
from
him
and
deals
high
initial
damage,
and
Audacious
Charge
makes
it
so
that
even
targets
with
escapes
can
be
chased
effectively.
Xin
Zhao
is
very
good
at
tower
diving
enemy
champions
who
are
low
on
health
,
even
at
low
levels;
a
combination
of
Crescent
Sweep
,
Three
Talon
Strike
and
Battle
Cry
can
grant
you
enough
defense
to
survive
the
tower
hits
and
damage
to
quickly
slay
your
opponent.
Audacious
Charge
slows
the
enemy
enough
to
be
able
to
land
your
Three
Talon
Strike
with
almost
complete
success
if
they
have
no
blink
or
dash
ability,
guaranteeing
the
knock
up.
Xin
Zhao
is
a
good
jungler
with
Battle
Cry
's
passive
effect
and
a
great
ganker
with
Audacious
Charge
and
Three
Talon
Strike
after
finishing
his
jungle
route.
The
best
time
to
gank
is
when
the
enemy
champion
has
recently
used
all
their
escape
summoner
spells
such
as
Ghost
and
Flash
(or
abilities
such
as
Arcane
Shift
or
Rocket
Jump
).
It
is
best
not
to
use
all
your
crowd
control
at
once,
time
each
of
your
crowd
control
abilities
with
your
ally
allowing
an
easy
kill
when
your
enemy
gets
out
of
melee
range
you
can
then
Audacious
Charge
to
ensure
your
kill.
Crescent
Sweep
can
assist
in
ganks
by
knocking
enemies
back
towards
your
allies,
but
be
sure
that
you
are
both
in
front
of
them
and
do
not
currently
have
your
target
Challenged
before
you
do
so.
Using
Audacious
Charge
on
a
minion
near
the
target
enemy
champion
will
prevent
them
from
being
Challenged
,
so
that
using
Crescent
Sweep
will
knock
them
back.
Audacious
Charge
can
be
used
to
escape
ganks
on
some
occasions
by
targeting
a
minion
or
a
champion
along
your
escape
route.
Combined
with
Flash
,
this
can
allow
Xin
Zhao
to
escape
most
unfavorable
fights.
Use
it
on
an
enemy
across
a
wall
for
a
clean
escape
(eg:
throw
ward
across
small
golems
wall,
then
dash
to
golems,
whne
they
flash
in
or
come
around,
flash
is
still
available
for
use)
Crescent
Sweep
can
be
used
to
knock
enemies
away
from
you
when
trying
to
escape.
When
attempting
a
retreat,
ensure
that
your
pursuer
has
not
been
Challenged
first
before
using
Crescent
Sweep
as
otherwise
it
will
have
no
effect
on
them.
Battle
Cry's
and
Three
Talon
Strike
can
kill
a
tower
very
quickly
in
late
game,
as
long
as
there
are
enough
minions
around
to
keep
it
from
targeting
Xin
Zhao
.
However,
if
building
AP,
Xin
Zhao's
heal
lets
him
sustain
from
tower
attacks
even
without
minions
around
him.
Build
usage
Xin
Zhao
is
a
natural
fighter
with
a
strong
reliance
on
autoattacks
and
an
excellent
attack
speed
steroid;
consequently,
items
that
grant
attack
damage
such
as
The
Bloodthirster
work
well
with
him.
Attack
speed
items
like
Phantom
Dancer
allows
Xin
Zhao
to
heal
from
the
passive
on
Battle
Cry
more
often,
increasing
his
survivability,
and
triggers
the
knock-up
from
Three
Talon
Strike
more
quickly.
If
you're
in
need
of
some
Magic
Resistance,
Wit's
End
is
a
very
good
item
for
him.
Items
that
offer
attack
damage
and
attack
speed
together
are
excellent
choices
for
Xin
Zhao
.
The
Black
Cleaver's
passive
armor
reduction
along
with
Challenge
can
grant
Xin
Zhao
massive
armor
shredding
power
against
squishy
targets.
Last
Whisper
also
works
well
with
his
innate
if
the
enemy
team
has
stacked
a
lot
of
armor
.
Note
that
armor
reduction
from
his
Challenge
passive
applies
before
armor
penetration
calculations
are
taken
into
account.
Trinity
Force
is
an
especially
useful
item
to
Xin
Zhao
.
The
attack
damage
of
the
item
increases
his
overall
DPS,
the
ability
power
increases
the
healing
from
Battle
Cry's
passive,
and
he
benefits
well
from
the
attack
speed
,
movement
speed
and
Phage
procs.
His
high
base
attack
damage
mean
he
can
also
proc
Sheen
for
massive
damage.
Purchasing
BotRK
,
Trinity
Force
,
and
Zephyr
at
the
same
time,
along
with
Battle
Cry's
active,
will
grant
enough
attack
speed
to
almost
reach
the
2.5
cap.
Randuin's
Omen
allows
Xin
Zhao
to
be
more
tanky.
Using
Crescent
Sweep
at
the
start
of
a
fight
will
increase
your
armor
and
magic
resistance
,
which
can
increase
the
duration
of
Randuin's
Omen's
active.
Frozen
Mallet
is
an
excellent
health
item
for
Xin
Zhao
,
and
the
40%
slow
is
extremely
helpful
in
preventing
your
target
from
kiting
you.
Getting
Atma's
Impaler
with
Frozen
Mallet
will
provide
considerable
additional
attack
damage
and
some
critical
strike
chance
which
has
excellent
synergy
with
Xin
Zhao
's
naturally
high
attack
speed
.
Cooldown
reduction
and
attack
speed
items
are
doubly
effective
on
Xin
Zhao
due
to
the
flat
CDR
on
Three
Talon
Strike
.
This
means
that
items
like
The
Brutalizer
and
Zeal
synergize
well
with
him.
Ravenous
Hydra
is
a
great
item
to
increase
survivability,
as
the
damage
and
health
steal
can
be
enough
to
keep
Xin
Zhao
alive
during
heated
fights,
especially
if
there
are
enough
minions
around
for
him
to
feed
on.

Countering
Xin
Zhao
is
very
vulnerable
to
kiting
when
his
Audacious
Charge
is
on
cooldown.
Try
to
CC
Xin
Zhao
when
he
is
attacking
you
or
your
ally,
The
crowd
control
effect
can
turn
the
tide
of
the
battle
to
your
allies
favor.
Build
armor
items
to
mitigate
his
damage
as
Xin
Zhao
mainly
deals
physical
damage.
When
engaging
Xin
Zhao
,
Try
to
split
with
your
allies
to
reduce
the
armor
and
magic
resistance
he
will
get
from
his
Crescent
Sweep
.
Keep
in
mind,
while
Challenged
you
can
not
get
knocked
back
from
Crescent
Sweep
.
This
makes
him
less
effective
1v1
after
he
used
Three
Talon
Strike
Frozen
Heart
is
a
great
counter
to
Xin
Zhao
since
it
reduces
damage
through
armor,
and
reduces
his
attack
speed,
which
is
central
to
his
damage
output.
Thornmail
is
a
great
alternative,
however
do
remember
that
he
can
heal
himself
through
the
damage
if
he
has
Life
steal
.
Avoid
stacking
health
without
armor
as
Crescent
Sweep
deals
physical
damage
based
on
your
current
health.
Stay
with
your
allies
when
fighting
Xin
Zhao,
he
can
only
knock
up
one
target
at
a
time.
