Trivia
Garen
was
designed
by
Geeves
.
Garen
is
voiced
by
Jamieson
Price
.
Garen
is
one
of
the
three
playable
champions
in
the
League
of
Legends
Proving
Grounds
tutorial,
alongside
Ashe
and
Ryze
.
Garen's
old
dance
is
a
choreography
by
N'Sync
in
the
music
video
for
"Bye
Bye
Bye".
A
side
by
side
comparison
can
be
seen
here.
Garen's
new
dance
is
a
reference
to
Johnny
Bravo
's
"Monkey
Dance".
A
side
by
side
comparison
can
be
seen
here
.
It
could
also
be
a
reference
to
Peter
Griffin
's
"
Bird
is
the
Word
".
Contrary
to
popular
belief,
Garen
yells
"Demacia!"
when
using
Courage
and
not
during
Judgment
or
Demacian
Justice
.
This
is
due
to
many
players
using
the
two
abilities
together
often
in
tandem.
The
phrase
"Spin
To
Win!"
originated
from
how
easily
some
kills
were
obtained
with
Judgment
.
The
most
famous
video
about
it
is
an
animation
of
Garen
spinning
his
sword
to
Ievan
Polkka
by
Loituma
.
When
using
Judgment
,
the
buff
is
described
as
"Garen
is
spinning
to
win."
This
is
now
used
as
a
term
to
refer
all
champions'
spinning
abilities,
such
as
Jax's
Counter
Strike
,
Katarina's
Death
Lotus
,
Rammus's
Powerball
,
Tryndamere's
Spinning
Slash
,
and
Wukong's
Cyclone
.
Coincidentally,
much
of
Garen's
kit
is
a
possible
basis
for
Wukong
,
mainly
due
to
both
characters
having:
A
"Q"
ability
that
scales
over
100%
in
attack
damage
as
an
attack
booster
with
an
extra
effect
(
Decisive
Strike
silences
with
a
movement
speed
boost
while
Wukong's
Crushing
Blow
reduces
armor
by
30%).
A
passive
ability
that
increases
their
defensive
stats
(with
Garen's
being
a
normal
ability
with
not
only
percentage
defensive
boosts,
but
also
with
a
damage
reduction
active
while
Wukong's
only
being
a
standard
passive
with
flat
defense
boosts.)
Point-and-click
spells;
Garen's
can
only
target
one
champion
with
it
and
acts
as
his
ult;
Wukong's
can
hit
two
extra
targets
in
range,
moves
him
to
said
target(s)
and
acts
as
a
normal
ability
instead.
Wukong's
Cyclone
and
Judgment
involve
a
very
similar
spinning
animation
and
the
way
their
hits
are
racked
up
and
how
they
can
involve
bonus
movement
speed
during
cast
time
and
cancellation.
A
number
of
certain
item
actives
and
summoner
spells
can
even
be
used
during
their
cast
times.
The
only
differences
here
are
that
Judgment
is
a
normal
ability
with
a
chance
to
critically
strike
per
hit
and
does
lower
damage
to
minions,
while
also
being
interruptible
with
Demacian
Justice
.
Cyclone
is
an
ult
itself
that
knocks
up
and
can
only
be
interrupted
on
command
instead
of
with
another
ability.
His
ultimate
is
mentioned
in
a
famous
Diablo
II:
Lord
of
Destruction
mod,
Median
XL,
in
a
form
of
a
sacred
unique
long
sword.
The
weapon
is
called
Demacian
Justice.
Garen
is
currently
the
only
champion
to
have
his
IP
price
reduced
twice.
Garen
pre-visual
update
was
one
of
the
few
champions
to
have
three
different
auto
attack
animations.
After
his
Visual
Update,
Garen
has
become
the
champion
with
the
highest
amount
of
jokes,
with
a
total
of
six,
surpassing
Vi
(who
previously
held
the
highest
amount
with
five)
and
Swain
and
Lux
(both
of
them
having
four).
Garen
is
one
of
the
8
champions
who
do
not
have
a
single
skill
that
scales
off
ability
power;
along
with
Darius
,
Draven
,
Olaf
,
Riven
,
Talon
,
Vayne
and
Zed
.
Quotes
Garen's
joke
and
his
taunt
were
changed
from
the
Test
Realm
to
Release.
The
previous
joke
was
"I
know
you're
in
that
bush!"
Garen's
old
joke
was
a
reference
to
the
Men's
Wearhouse
commercials,
which
always
end
with
the
line,
"You're
gonna
like
the
way
you
look.
I
Garen-tee
it.
Get
it?"
Garen
shares
a
quote
with
Irelia
:
"Forge
Onward."
Garen
shares
a
quote
with
Hecarim
:
"Break
their
ranks!"
Skins
In
Garen's
basic
skin
art
he
wears
a
full
glove
on
his
left
hand
and
no
glove
on
his
right,
while
on
his
ingame
model
he
wears
fingerless
gloves
on
both
hands.
In
his
Dreadknight
and
Rugged
skin
arts
he
is
holding
his
sword
in
his
left
hand,
but
in-game
he
holds
it
in
his
right
hand.
Dreadknight
Garen
is
most
likely
a
reference
to
the
class
Death
Knight
from
World
of
Warcraft
.
His
gear
closely
resembles
their
gear
and
he
has
the
typical
Death
Knight's
glowing
blue
eyes.
Rugged
Garen
was
originally
called
"Vagabond
Garen"
,
and
may
be
based
on
Geralt
from
the
book
and
game
series,
The
Witcher
.
Several
of
Garen's
skins
appear
to
be
references
to
factions
from
the
Warhammer
40,000
series
Sanguine
Garen
is
possibly
a
homage
to
the
Blood
Angels
of
which
their
primarch
(leader)
is
Sanguinius
.
Commando
Garen
is
a
reference
to
the
Imperial
Guard
.
Steel
Legion
Garen
skin
is
a
reference
to
the
Grey
Knights
,
and
he
shares
this
skin
with
Lux
.
The
weight
of
the
skin
is
enough
to
make
him
not
able
to
somersault
forward
during
his
Decisive
Strike
,
instead
making
him
leap
straight
up.
After
the
visual
upgrade,
this
is
true
for
all
the
skins.
Relations
Garen
and
Katarina
first
fought
during
a
war
between
Demacia
and
Noxus
.
Garen
has
fought
with
her
ever
since,
whenever
the
opportunity
presents
itself.
Garen
and
Katarina
were
the
ones
who
stopped
the
inter-city
brawl
in
Kalamanda
.
According
to
Blitzcrank's
"Fleshling
Compatibility
Service,"
a
dating
service
made
by
Blitzcrank,
Katarina
and
Garen
make
a
perfect
couple,
but
are
not
officially
together.
Fans
have
since
been
joking
about
their
relationship.
When
he
jokes
a
nearby
enemy
Katarina,
he's
trying
to
impress
her
with
how
many
push-ups
he
can
do.
In
the
other
joke
he
has
a
flirty
tone
in
his
voice.
During
a
Creative
Design
AMA
about
Katarina
,
when
asked
about
the
relationship
between
herself
and
Garen,
RiotRaven
stated
that
they
aren't
quite
rivals,
yet
have
"
a
romantic
connection,
from
times
gone
by.
"
The
sixth
issue
of
the
Journal
of
Justice
states
Garen's
family
name
is
Crownguard,
and
every
member
of
his
family
has
joined
the
Demacian
armed
forces.
His
father
and
mother,
Marcus
and
Lilia,
are
officials
of
the
legislative
Demacian
Council.
His
younger
sister
Lux
joined
the
military
when
she
was
thirteen.
Garen
is
a
childhood
companion
of
Jarvan
IV
,
the
crown
prince
of
Demacia.
When
Jarvan
was
captured
by
Noxian
forces,
Garen
led
his
Dauntless
Vanguard
through
enemy
lines
and
rescued
Jarvan
before
he
could
be
executed.
He
bisected
Urgot,
The
Headman's
Pride
in
the
process.
Garen
once
protected
Katarina
when
she
came
to
Demacia
to
protest
about
High
Councilor
Heywan
Relivash's
conspiracy
in
Kalamanda
along
with
Jarvan
IV
.
