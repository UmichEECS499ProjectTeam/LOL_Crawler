Trivia
Talon
was
designed
by
Hephastopheles
.
[1]
Talon's
champion
title
was
first
"The
Blade
Rogue",
and
later
"The
Shadow's
Blade".
When
he
was
released
his
champion
title
got
changed
again
to
"The
Blade's
Shadow".
It
is
unknown
exactly
why
his
title
was
changed
to
"The
Blade's
Shadow".
The
title
may
relate
to
his
service
under
General
Du
Couteau.
In
French
"Couteau"
means
"knife",
indicating
that
General
Du
Couteau
was
the
"Blade"
while
Talon
was
the
"Shadow".
Talon's
original
placeholder
name
was
Bertrand.
The
bird-like
creature
perched
on
the
fallen
sword
in
the
Sneak
Peek
bears
a
striking
resemblance
to
Beatrice,
Swain
's
raven,
hinting
that
Talon's
past
may
be
interlaced
with
Swain's
in
some
way.
Similarly,
the
black
roses
surrounding
the
fallen
sword
in
the
Sneak
Peek
likely
represent
the
Black
Rose,
an
organization
of
which
LeBlanc
is
the
leader.
Both
champions
are
elements
of
Noxus's
elite.
Talon
is
voiced
by
Travis
Willingham
.
Travis
Willingham
and
Laura
Bailey
(voices
of
Talon
and
Akali
respectively)
are
a
married
couple.
Talon's
dance
is
inspired
by
"Billie
Jean"
and
includes
Michael
Jackson's
moonwalk
and
crotch
grab.
His
passive
refers
to
"
mercy
killing
",
the
act
of
killing
quickly
to
end
a
dying
person's
agony.
Talon's
design
elements,
background
and
appearance
are
all
reminiscent
of
the
main
characters
of
the
Assassin's
Creed
video
game
series
as
well
as
Thief
The
Dark
Project.
Talon
is
one
of
the
8
champions
who
do
not
have
a
single
skill
that
scales
off
ability
power;
along
with
Darius
,
Draven
,
Garen
,
Olaf
,
Riven
,
Vayne
and
Zed
.

Couteau
family.
Crimson
Elite
Talon
is
part
of
Noxus's
Crimson
Elite
theme,
meant
to
be
the
Noxian
counterpart
to
the
Demacian
Commando
skins.
So
far,
the
only
other
Crimson
Elite
member
is
Riven
,
though
she
may
have
left
the
unit
as
she
is
a
Noxian
exile.
Talon
shares
Crimson
Elite
theme
with
Riven
.
In
the
Chinese
client,
his
Crimson
Elite
Talon
is
renamed
"Nemesis
Talon"
and
his
Renegade
Talon
to
"Street
Talon".
Dragonblade
Talon
appears
to
be
referencing
Strider
Hiryu
from
the
Strider/Marvel
vs
Capcom
series.
Talon
shares
Dragonblade
theme
with
Riven
.
Relations
Talon
is
part
of
the
"Crimson
Elite"
alongside
possible
former
member
Riven
.
Talon
was
once
spared
by
General
Du
Couteau
and
in
turn
became
his
ally
alongside
with
Katarina
.
Talon
was
taken
in
by
the
Du
Couteau
family
and
she
regards
Talon
as
a
colleague
and,
in
some
ways,
a
little
brother.
However,
she
also
treats
him
like
an
emotional
punching
bag
from
time
to
time.
Cassiopeia
doesn't
share
those
feelings.
She
sees
him
as
an
outsider
and
treats
him
that
way.
Talon
and
Quinn
are
rivals.
As
revealed
in
Talon's
League
Judgement,
Talon
used
to
have
a
friend
and
partner
in
crime
back
when
he
was
a
young
thief
on
the
streets
of
Noxus.
His
name
was
Kavyn
and
the
two
lived
together
in
an
unused
pipe
in
the
sewers.
The
two
of
them
often
teamed
up
to
steal
food
and
other
things
from
merchants
on
the
streets,
however
Kavyn
was
very
unreliable
and
often
caused
Talon
to
nearly
get
caught.
One
day,
after
another
failure
due
to
Kavyn's
incompetence,
Kavyn
gave
Talon
some
daggers,
which
Talon
promptly
used
to
kill
Kavyn.
