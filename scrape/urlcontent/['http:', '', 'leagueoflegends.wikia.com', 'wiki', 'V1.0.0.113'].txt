League
of
Legends
V1.0.0.113
Champions
Nocturne,
the
Eternal
Nightmare
(
Original
Stats
)
Duskbringer
:
Nocturne
throws
a
shadow
blade
which
deals
damage,
leaves
a
Dusk
Trail,
and
causes
champions
to
leave
a
Dusk
Trail.
While
on
the
trail,
Nocturne
ignores
unit
collision
and
has
increased
Movement
Speed
and
Attack
Damage.
Shroud
of
Darkness
:
Nocturne
empowers
his
blades,
passively
gaining
attack
speed.
Activating
Shroud
of
Darkness
allows
Nocturne
to
fade
into
the
shadows,
creating
a
magical
barrier
which
blocks
a
single
enemy
spell
and
doubles
his
passive
attack
speed
if
successful.
Unspeakable
Horror
:
Nocturne
plants
a
nightmare
into
his
target's
mind,
dealing
damage
each
second
and
fearing
the
target
if
they
do
not
get
out
of
range
by
the
end
of
the
duration.
Paranoia
(Ultimate):
Nocturne
reduces
the
sight
radius
of
all
enemy
champions
and
removes
their
ally
vision
in
the
process.
He
can
then
launch
himself
at
a
nearby
enemy
champion.
Umbra
Blades
(Innate):
Every
10
seconds,
Nocturne's
next
attack
strikes
surrounding
enemies
for
physical
damage
and
heals
himself
for
each
target
hit.
Nocturne's
physical
attacks
reduce
this
cooldown
by
1
second.
Akali
