Bag
of
Tea
was
a
consumable
item
in
League
of
Legends
.
Trivia
The
effect
of
the
item
is
probably
a
reference
to
tea-bagging,
a
gesture
of
disrespect
found
in
video
gaming,
particularly
in
first
person
shooters.
Tea-bagging
is
done
by
crouching
repeatedly
on
a
dead
opponent's
corpse,
the
performer's
genitals
acting
as
some
form
of
'tea
bag',
usually
performed
after
scoring
the
kill,
as
an
additional
insult
to
injury,
hence
why
the
item
can
only
be
used
after
scoring
a
kill.
The
icon
is
probably
also
a
reference
to
the
male
testes,
due
to
the
resemblance
of
the
two
tea-bag.
