Agitated
If
Vi
or
Jinx
perform
one
of
their
special
taunts
toward
Caitlyn
,
Caitlyn
receives
the
debuff
"Agitated".
This
debuff
lasts
until
Caitlyn
damages
the
source
or
dies.
Vi
-
"Agitated:
How
agitating."
Jinx
-
"Agitated:
And
you
thought
Vi
was
obnoxious."
Catch
me
if
you
can!
Whenever
Jinx
is
on
an
opposing
team
to
Caitlyn
and/or
Vi
,
they
each
gain
a
debuff
titled,
"Catch
me
if
you
can!".
Jinx's
debuff
states
"Cait
and
Vi
are
chasing
you.
How
fun!
Cops
Outsmarted:"
followed
by
her
total
number
of
Caitlyn/Vi
kills/assists.
Caitlyn
and
Vi's
debuff
states
"Jinx
is
causing
chaos
again.
How
obnoxious...
Criminals
Apprehended:"
followed
by
their
Jinx
kills/assists.
Additionally,
Jinx
gains
1
bonus
gold
for
each
cop
she
outsmarts;
and
Caitlyn
and
Vi
gain
1
bonus
gold
for
each
criminal
they
apprehend.
Assists
count.
Damnation
Nunu
and
Willump
will
drop
one
soul
each
,
for
a
total
of
two
souls!
[1]
While
similar,
Sejuani
and
Bristle
only
drop
one
soul
between
them.
This
had
led
to
a
joke
among
the
community
that
Sejuani
has
ginger
hair
in
reference
to
the
internet
meme
that
gingers
have
no
soul.
[2]
Good
Enough
To
Eat
When
Chum
the
Waters
scores
the
killing
blow
on
a
small
champion,
Chompers
will
eat
the
body
-
hiding
the
corpse
that
champion
would
usually
leave
on
the
ground.
[3]
This
has
been
confirmed
to
affect:
Annie
,
Amumu
,
an
enemy
Fizz
,
Kennen
,
Lulu
,
Poppy
,
Tristana
,
Veigar
and
Ziggs
.
However,
it
does
not
seem
to
affect
Heimerdinger
or
Teemo
.
Inverse
Ninja
Strength
Ninjas
are
more
effective
when
they
work
alone.
For
every
Ninja
on
your
team
beyond
yourself,
you
lose
1
health.
[4]
Akali
Kennen
Shen
Zed
This
is
only
true
for
champions
who
have
the
"This
unit
is
a
flippin'
ninja!"
cosmetic
buff.
Other
champions
with
ninja
skins,
such
as
Ninja
Rammus
,
do
not
count.
On
The
Prowl
Nidalee
features
a
hidden
passive
that
grants
her
the
power
of
a
"
cougar
".
Nearby
allied
champions
gain
+5
experience
every
5
seconds
if
they
are
a
lower
level
than
Nidalee.
[5]
Piltover's
Finest
If
Caitlyn
and
Vi
are
on
the
same
team,
they
each
receive
the
cosmetic
buff
On
The
Case
:
"Piltover's
Finest."
Whenever
they
work
together
to
score
a
kill,
they
will
each
receive
1
bonus
gold.
They
also
share
a
selection
of
special
taunts
.

no
requirement
to

buff
other

In

nature:
[6]
When

by

grows
slightly,
as

could
keep
an
armored
