The
Tutorial
is
a
type
of
game
in
which
the
player
is
guided
to
learn
the
basis
and
more
complex
concepts
of
the
League
of
Legends
gameplay.
The
player
is
set
with
bots
as
allies
and
enemies
instead
of
other
players.

The
Howling

old
Proving

Screen
New
Proving
Grounds
Loading
Screen
You
are
guided
through
the
most
basic
elements
of
League
of
Legends.
Ashe
was
pre-selected
as
your
Champion
,
in
a
one-lane
map,
with
Heal
and
Revive
as
your
summoner
spells.
You
face
Trundle
.
An
ally
is
also
in
the
map,
Nunu
but
he
only
demonstrates
that
you
can't
face
a
turret
without
any
team
minions
.
You
finish
the
tutorial
when
the
Nexus
is
destroyed.
The
only
purchaseable
item
in
the
tutorial
is
Thornmail
.
In
the
tutorial
you
cannot
die.
If
you
start
getting
attacked
a
lot,
the
level
starts
reducing
the
amount
of
damage
you
take
until
it
gets
to
0.
Sometime
around
December,
2010,
the
loading
screen
was
changed.
This
most
likely
happened
when
the
Battle
Training
came
out.
Proving
Grounds
was
later
replaced
by
the
Howling
Abyss
and
Master
Yi
was
replaced
by
Trundle
as
well.
This
tutorial
teaches
the
very
basics
of
the
game,
such
as
Not
running
into
a
turret
without
minions
Summoner
spells
Abilities
Battle
Training

In
November
2010,
it
was
announced
that
Riot
had
been
working
on
a
new
comprehensive
tutorial.
This
tutorial
would
explain
the
elements
of
the
game
in
a
much
more
in-depth
way,
allowing
the
player
to
learn
while
they
play.
It
sets
a
series
of
simple
quests
on
Summoner's
Rift
for
the
player
to
complete,
from
buying
items
to
killing
neutral
camps.
[1]
On
this
tutorial
the
player
is
taken
through
various
steps
of
the
champion
selecting
process,
which
the
player
may
choose
from
three
champions:
Ashe
,
Garen
,
and
Ryze
.
The
player
is
then
placed
with
4
bots
in
the
blue
team
(these
bots
are
always
the
same:
Master
Yi
goes
top,
Soraka
goes
mid,
while
Shen
and
Sivir
go
bot),
while
the
enemy
bots
are
Malphite
,
Sivir
,
Nasus
,
Annie
,
and
Master
Yi
.
Throughout
the
tutorial,
the
player
learns
concepts
such
as:
Map
awareness
Last
hitting
Ultimates
&
Passives
(
Innates
)
Jungle
monsters
Lane
names
(top,
mid,
bot)
Basics
about
turrets
(aggro
pertaining
to
champions
and
minions)
How
to
win
Additionally,
the
player
is
given
quests
which
are
unique
to
the
Battle
Training
and
are
not
seen
in
normal
games.
These
quests
include
clearing
monster
camps,
killing
minions,
destroying
all
turrets
in
a
lane,
and
destroying
inhibitors.
The
player
earns
additional
gold
from
completing
these
quests.
In
the
Battle
Training,
turrets
have
lower
health
than
in
normal
games.
The
outer
turrets
have
the
same
amount
of
health
as
turrets
in
a
typical
game,
but
the
deeper
one
goes
into
enemy
teritory,
the
progressively
lower
turret
health
becomes,
down
to
525
on
the
nexus
turrets.
The
health
totals
of
the
inhibitors
and
the
nexus
are
unchanged.
The
tutorial
gives
your
champion
15
bonus
attack
damage
,
30
bonus
ability
power
,
25
bonus
armor
,
and
31
bonus
magic
resist
in
addition
to
runes
and
masteries.
If
you
lose
the
Battle
Training,
the
game
will
end,
but
there
will
be
no
Continue
Button,
making
it
impossible
to
close
the
game
by
internal
means.
