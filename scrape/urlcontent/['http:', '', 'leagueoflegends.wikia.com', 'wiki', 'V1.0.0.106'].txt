Notes
from
the
design
team
This
patch
is
focused
upon
the
following
main
issues:
Area
of
Effect
damage
and
disable
spells
being
too
powerful.
Area
of
Effect
is
taking
a
pretty
large
hit
this
patch,
especially
to
the
damage
on
Galio's
Idol
of
Durand
,
Morgana's
Soul
Shackles
and
Vladimir's
Hemoplague
.
After
seeing
its
effect
on
the
game
over
a
longer
period
of
time,
we’ve
found
something
more
akin
to
Annie's
Summon:
Tibbers
is
a
proper
mix
of
area
size,
damage,
and
disable.
We
have
several
area-effect
skills
in
the
game
that
have
power
creeped
past
this
and
we’re
looking
to
bring
this
back
to
acceptable
levels.
Twitch's
Spray
and
Pray
is
a
big
factor
in
this.
We
are
considering
bigger
changes
for
that
ability.
Strong
supports
are
able
to
protect
powerful
ranged
carries
too
well,
cancelling
their
fragility
too
easily.
We’re
starting
with
a
duration
nerf
to
Morgana's
Black
Shield
and
Janna's
Eye
Of
The
Storm
to
reward
better
timing
of
the
spell
reactively
and
to
raise
the
skill
ceiling
a
bit
on
these
spells.
If
this
proves
too
little,
we’ll
provide
additional
nerfs
in
the
upcoming
patch.
Ranged
carries,
holistically,
are
too
safe
considering
their
damage
output.
While
we
predict
bigger
changes
will
be
required,
our
first
adjustments
are
to
lower
the
movement
speeds
of
ranged
carry-style
champions
to
provide
more
of
a
tradeoff,
and
nerf
Blessing
of
the
Lizard
Elder
when
used
on
ranged
champions.
We’d
like
to
keep
ranged
carries
“safer”
than
melee,
but
start
to
provide
more
tradeoffs
to
both
give
melee
a
place
in
the
game
and
differentiate
the
roles
of
melee
and
ranged
characters.

Troll
(

Stats
