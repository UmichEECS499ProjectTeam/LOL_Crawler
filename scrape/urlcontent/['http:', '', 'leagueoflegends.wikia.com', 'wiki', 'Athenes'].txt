Explanation
The
unique
passives
on
Athene's
Unholy
Grail
and
Chalice
of
Harmony
are
commonly
misunderstood.
They
will
increase
mana
regeneration
from
all
sources
based
on
how
much
mana
the
champion
is
missing.
If
your
champion
has
0
mana,
they
are
missing
100%
of
their
mana
and
therefore
their
mana
regeneration
is
increased
by
100%
(i.e.
the
regeneration
is
doubled).
The
actual
amount
of
additional
regeneration
is
based
on
the
amount
of
base
mana
regeneration.
This
is
demonstrated
with
the
following
situations:
A
champion
has
8
Mp5
and
is
currently
at
25%
mana
(missing
75%).
Chalice
will
increase
regen
by
75%
to
yield
14
Mp5
(passive
provides
6
additional
Mp5).
A
champion
has
8
Mp5
and
is
currently
at
50%
mana
(missing
50%).
Chalice
will
increase
regen
by
50%
to
yield
12
Mp5
(passive
provides
4
additional
MP5).
A
champion
has
20
Mp5
and
is
currently
at
75%
mana
(missing
25%).
Chalice
will
increase
regen
by
25%
to
yield
25
Mp5
(passive
provides
5
additional
Mp5).
A
champion
has
10
Mp5
and
is
currently
at
75%
mana
(missing
25%).
Chalice
will
increase
regen
by
25%
to
yield
12.
5
Mp5
(passive
provides
2.
5
additional
Mp5).
With
greater
base
mana
regeneration,
the
unique
passive
on
these
items
is
more
effective.
Ironically,
with
more
mana
regeneration,
they
become
less
necessary,
unless
one
needs
it
badly.
However,
the
more
mana
you
have,
the
more
time
this
item
has
to
be
useful,
as
it
will
grant
you
increased
mana
regeneration
for
a
longer
time.
Development
Announcement
made
by
ByronicHero
:
[1]
In
the
Darius
Patch,
we’ll
also
be
rolling
out
a
new
upgrade
option
to
the
classic
Magic
Resistance
item
Chalice
of
Harmony.
To
help
keep
Chalice
a
viable
item
choice
late
into
the
game,
we
wanted
to
add
a
late
game
upgrade
aimed
specifically
at
Ability
Power
carries
who
might
have
trouble
keeping
their
Mana
high.
With
that
in
mind,
we’ve
added
the
option
to
add
some
damage
stats
later
in
the
game
by
upgrading
to
Athene’s
Unholy
Grail.
The
Chalice
Conundrum
The
added
Magic
Resistance
from
Chalice
of
Harmony
combined
with
the
heavy
Mana
Regeneration
granted
by
its
unique
passive
makes
it
an
attractive
option
for
an
Ability
Power
in
a
disadvantageous
position
–
particularly
one
that
is
heavily
reliant
on
the
Crest
of
the
Ancient
Golem.
In
the
event
that
you
find
yourself
behind
your
lane
opponent
with
the
enemy
team
invading
your
jungle,
a
timely
Chalice
can
give
you
the
added
durability
you
need
to
rally.
Meanwhile,
the
rapid
Mana
Regeneration
can
function
as
a
sort
of
surrogate
golem
buff,
allowing
even
the
most
heavily
Mana
reliant
caster
to
continue
fighting
effectively.
Unfortunately,
while
Chalice
of
Harmony
might
be
the
right
item
choice
to
fuel
an
early
game
comeback,
without
any
damage
stats
mage
players
often
sell
it
as
the
game
wears
on
or
simply
avoid
buying
it
altogether.
For
this
reason,
we
decided
to
offer
the
option
to
pick
up
a
little
a
little
extra
bang
for
your
buck
by
upgrading
to
Athene’s
Unholy
Grail.
My
Cup
Runneth
Over
To
give
Chalice
of
Harmony
the
staying
power
it
needs
to
carry
on
into
late
game,
we
decided
to
add
the
option
combine
it
with
Fiendish
Codex
to
build
Athene’s
Unholy
Grail.
With
some
added
Ability
Power
and
Cooldown
Reduction,
Athene’s
Unholy
Grail
can
easily
function
as
a
core
item
for
mages
interested
in
picking
up
some
additional
durability.
Moreover,
in
addition
to
the
passive
Mana
Regeneration
afforded
by
Chalice
of
Harmony’s
unique
passive,
Athene’s
Unholy
Grail
also
has
the
added
benefit
of
granting
a
significant
Mana
bonus
upon
scoring
a
kill
or
assist.
This
can
keep
an
aggressively
ganking
Ability
Power
carry
topped
off
and
in
the
field,
as
well
as
grant
some
additional
staying
power
over
the
course
of
a
protracted
team
fight.
I’ll
Drink
to
That!
With
the
addition
of
a
few
offensive
stats
and
a
new,
offensively
focused
Mana
Regeneration
mechanic,
the
new
upgrade
to
Chalice
of
Harmony
should
make
it
a
more
attractive
option
for
casters
early
on
in
the
game.
Upgrading
to
Athene’s
Unholy
Grail,
can
help
you
convert
that
early
game
comeback
into
late
game
staying
power.
Trivia
The
item
is
named
after
Athene
,
a
summoner
who
got
5,000
referrals
and
is
a
popular
figure
in
video
gaming,
most
notable
for
playing
World
of
Warcraft
prior
to
LoL.
Athene
is
an
alternative
spelling
of
Athena,
the
Greek
Goddess
of
battle
strategy.
Athene's
Unholy
Grail
was
codenamed
"Chalice
of
Discord"
before
its
final
name
was
settled
upon.
This
nickname
is
an
ironic
contrast
to
its
lesser
component
item
Chalice
of
Harmony
,
and
is
probably
intended
to
highlight
the
more
offensive
properties
of
the
item.
