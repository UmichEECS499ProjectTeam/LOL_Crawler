Strategy
Aegis
of
the
Legion
is
very
useful
on
support
and
tank
champions
.
Aegis
of
the
Legion
becomes
more
effective
with
more
nearby
teammates.
Therefore,
a
team
that
has
one
has
a
significant
advantage
in
teamfights.
Aegis
of
the
Legion
does
not
stack,
except
between
the
two
players
who
own
it,
who
will
receive
the
effects
twice.
A
third
player
nearby
will
only
receive
it's
effects
once.
