Skill
usage
Thundering
Shuriken
can
be
used
to
detect
enemies
hiding
in
the
brush,
as
a
sound
effect
will
play
if
it
impacts
a
target.
Thundering
Shuriken
is
very
effective
for
harassment
.
Taking
more
than
one
point
in
it
early
game
allows
you
to
harass
the
enemy
really
hard
while
not
being
in
range
to
take
damage.
Using
Electrical
Surge
after
players
have
2
stacks
of
Mark
of
the
Storm
is
an
easy
way
to
stun.
Don't
forget
that
Electrical
Surge
has
a
passive
component,
try
to
save
the
passive
mark
applying
attack
for
combos
or
harass.
Kennen
is
a
great
farmer
if
you
use
Lightning
Rush
combined
with
Electrical
Surge
.
Using
Lightning
Rush
to
dodge
skillshots
and
run
away
is
a
good
idea.
Lightning
Rush
can
be
used
to
initiate
fights
with
its
energy
return
component,
allowing
him
to
use
other
abilities
afterward.
While
in
Lightning
Rush
form,
Kennen
cannot
perform
normal
attacks,
but
can
use
all
of
his
abilities.
Lightning
Rush
can
be
coupled
with
the
summoner
spell
Ghost
to
move
at
very
high
speeds,
with
Kennen's
stun
this
is
excellent
for
chasing.
Lightning
Rush
can
be
used
to
get
back
to
lane
quicker.
After
a
team
fight
has
initiated,
use
Lightning
Rush
to
apply
marks
to
as
many
enemies
as
possible,
followed
by
Electrical
Surge
and
Slicing
Maelstrom
.
This
combo
adds
two
marks
initially,
followed
by
one
mark
for
the
stun,
and
then
adds
an
additional
two
marks,
leaving
any
runners
ready
to
be
stunned
with
Thundering
Shuriken
.
Alternatively,
saving
energy
and
waiting
for
a
second
Electrical
Surge
will
result
in
a
second
AoE
stun.
A
good
skill
sequence
to
harass
an
enemy
or
to
scare
them
off
is
Lightning
Rush
,
Electrical
Surge
,
and
Thundering
Shuriken
(if
possible).
The
reason
why
this
combo
can
scare
enemy's
is
because
it
can
stun
or
get
ready
to
stun.
Kennen
is
a
champion
who
relies
heavily
on
combos.
Some
simple
combos
are:
Lightning
Rush
+
Electrical
Surge
+
Electrical
Surge
(passive)
+
Thundering
Shuriken
-
this
combo
works
extremely
well
from
levels
3-5
(ie
before
Slicing
Maelstrom
is
learned).
At
level
2,
Kennen
can
do
a
Electrical
Surge
+
Electrical
Surge
(passive)
+
Thundering
Shuriken
combo
to
result
in
a
highly
damaging
stun
and
a
few
auto
attacks
during
the
stun.
Once
reaching
level
6,
Kennen
gains
the
ability
to
stun
an
opponent
twice
using
a
Lightning
Rush
+
Electrical
Surge
+
Electrical
Surge
(passive)
+
Slicing
Maelstrom
+
Thundering
Shuriken
combo.
For
this
combo,
wait
the
longest
time
possible
between
the
Electrical
Surge
(passive)
(which
completes
the
1st
stun)
and
your
Slicing
Maelstrom
(which
completes
the
second
stun)
to
regenerate
Energy,
land
free
auto
attacks,
and
position
yourself
behind
the
enemy.
The
key
to
playing
well
is
learning
how
to
chain
his
combos
together
to
be
able
to
land
free
damage
on
the
enemy
while
keeping
them
in
a
disadvantageous
position.
A
good
way
to
build
Kennen
is
a
balanced
build,
which
focus
on
building
tankiness
as
well
as
damage.
With
all
three
skills
at
rank
2,
Kennen
becomes
a
powerful
enemy.
Kennen's
Slicing
Maelstrom
is
amazing
for
turning
team
fights
around.
It
is
key
that
his
R
is
used
as
much
as
possible
against
multiple
opponents,
but
only
at
the
right
time.
Kennen
tends
to
be
an
initiator
or
to
follow
immediately
behind
an
initiator
thanks
to
Slicing
Maelstrom
.
Using
Slicing
Maelstrom
wisely
in
a
team
fight,
in
conjunction
with
Lightning
Rush
and
Electrical
Surge
,
nearly
guarantees
a
viable
amount
of
energy
gained
from
Mark
of
the
Storm
because
Kennen's
cooldowns
tend
to
end
more
quickly
than
Kennen's
energy
regenerates.
Remember
that
Lightning
Rush
also
provides
you
with
a
great
boost
of
your
armor
and
magic
resistance
meaning
it
can
save
you
from
fatal
situations
like
Karthus'
Requiem
or
skills
that
do
damage
over
time,
notice
however
that
it
won't
reduce
true
damage.
One
of
Kennen
's
biggest
strengths
is
his
flexibility
of
item
builds
in
any
given
situation.
Kennen
can
easily
be
built
either
as
an
attack
damage
carry
or
an
ability
power
based
carry.
He's
also
a
very
powerful
top
laner
in
both
attack
damage
and
ability
power
based
builds
due
to
his
decent
attack
damage
scaling
and
Electrical
Surge
passive
and
split
pushing
ability
because
his
Lightning
Rush
can
serve
as
a
good
escape
mechanism
in
sticky
situations
as
well
as
serving
a
good
pushing
skill
in
conjunction
to
his
Electrical
Surge
active.
Ability
Power
build
strongly
utilizes
his
Thundering
Shuriken
,
Electrical
Surge
's
active,
and
Slicing
Maelstrom
.
The
ability
power
build
brings
more
teamfight
presence
and
large
crowd
control
stuns
on
the
enemy
teams
who
tend
to
be
grouped
together.
Because
Kennen
needs
to
be
in
the
frontlines
to
utilize
his
ultimate,
he
needs
to
built
a
bit
tanky
in
addition
to
ability
power
since
he
will
most
likely
be
focused
on.
The
ability
power
build
synergizes
well
with
champions
who
have
heavy
area
of
effect
damage
(i.e.
Ezreal
,
Ziggs
,
Amumu
,
and
Nunu
)
or
dive
heavy
team
compositions.
Attack
damage
builds
are
almost
similar
to
an
attack
damage
carry
where
he
puts
more
emphasis
on
autoattacking
because
of
his
Electrical
Surge
passive
scales
in
attack
damage
and
his
strong
self
crowd
control
and
utility
ability
with
his
Mark
of
the
Storm
,
something
that
most
attack
damage
carries
lack
with
a
few
exceptions
like
Ashe
and
Varus
.
Because
Kennen
uses
Energy
rather
than
mana,
he
has
better
sustain
than
many
other
attack
damage
carries
except
Sivir
.
Building
Kennen
as
an
attack
damage
carry
is
recommended
for
those
who
have
difficulty
landing
his
Thundering
Shuriken
,
laning
with
supports
who
lack
any
forms
of
healing
or
sustaining
the
attack
damage
carry
like
Lulu
,
Blitzcrank
,
Leona
,
and
Thresh
,
or
team
compositions
who
tend
to
focus
on
a
single
target.
Keep
in
note
that
attack
damage
carry
Kennen
tends
to
fall
flat
late
game
against
other
late
game
oriented
attack
damage
carries
like
(
Tristana
and
Kog'Maw
)
because
he
is
really
reliant
on
autoattacking
where
his
range
is
equivalent
to
Vayne
and
lacks
good
attack
speed/damage
steroid
unless
he
is
fed
early.
Build
usage
Getting
double
Doran's
Blade
early
game
allows
Kennen
to
be
a
strong
lane
bully
with
the
passive
of
Electrical
Surge
as
well
as
give
a
little
survivability.
Sheen
and
Lich
Bane
are
effective
items
on
Kennen.
If
Kennen
is
played
as
a
caster,
Lich
Bane
is
useful
for
increasing
the
amount
of
damage
he
does,
especially
since
his
Thundering
Shuriken
can
be
used
every
4
seconds
at
rank
5.
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
can
be
very
good
with
his
Lightning
Rush
,
since
you
can
get
very
fast
to
any
opponent
and
slow
him
this
way,
and
once
slowed
your
target
can
be
comboed
easily.
Since
Kennen
usually
relies
on
being
in
the
middle
of
their
team
an
Abyssal
Scepter
can
provide
you
with
more
damage
and
survivability
while
the
negative
aura
will
also
boost
the
damage
of
your
allied
magic
damage
dealers.
Since
Kennen
does
sustained
damage
using
energy,
building
an
early
Hextech
Revolver
is
a
good
idea
for
him,
particularly
if
you
are
facing
a
champion
who
has
their
own
built-in
sustain
like
Renekton
,
Vladimir
,
and
Yorick
.
When
upgrading
Hextech
Revolver
,
a
Hextech
Gunblade
is
far
superior
item
than
Will
of
the
Ancients
despite
being
more
expensive
for
several
reasons.
First,
the
spell
vamp
procs
in
all
of
his
abilities,
including
his
Electrical
Surge
's
passive.
Second,
Hextech
Gunblade
grants
attack
damage
and
life
steal
,
which
greatly
enhances
his
sustain
when
autoattacks
with
Electrical
Surge
passive.
Finally,
Kennen
does
not
benefit
from
Will
of
the
Ancients
's
mana
regeneration,
as
he
uses
energy
as
his
resource
instead
of
mana.
Because
most
of
the
foes
will
be
stunned,
Liandry's
Torment
is
a
good
item
to
build
on
Kennen
for
the
item's
passive.
Liandry's
Torment
also
procs
with
Kennen's
Electrical
Surge
passive
as
well.
It's
recommended
to
build
AP
along
with
defensive
items
as
Kennen's
full
combo
requires
getting
close
to
enemy
champions
and
therefore
survivability
will
be
a
must
during
teamfights.
As
Slicing
Maelstrom
is
not
a
channeled
ability,
you
can
use
it
in
conjunction
with
Zhonya's
Hourglass
or
Wooglet's
Witchcap
for
a
powerful
combo.
Giving
Kennen
Nashor's
Tooth
is
good
for
the
passive
effect
of
his
Electrical
Surge
as
it
gives
him
some
AP
to
deal
more
damage
with
spells.
Other
attack
speed
items
such
as
Wit's
End
,
Blade
of
the
Ruined
King
,
Statikk
Shiv
,
and
Runaan's
Hurricane
are
good
items
to
build
in
his
kit.
Much
like
Lulu
,
Fizz
,
Kayle
,
Kassadin
,
Nidalee
,
Orianna
,
and
Teemo
,
Kennen
is
one
of
the
few
champions
that
greatly
benefits
by
mixing
attack
speed
with
AP.
Statikk
Shiv
and
Runaan's
Hurricane
greatly
increases
Kennen's
wave
clearing
capacity,
particularly
the
later
where
he
can
quickly
gain
Electrical
Surge
stacks
for
his
passive.
While
a
niche
option,
because
of
Kennen's
high
attack
speed
growth,
a
decent
attack
damage
growth,
and
the
utilization
of
his
Electrical
Surge
;
Kennen
can
effectively
be
built
as
an
attack
damage
carry
in
a
similar
sense
like
Ezreal
.
Items
like
Phantom
Dancer
,
Trinity
Force
,
Statikk
Shiv
,
Blade
of
the
Ruined
King
,
Wit's
End
,
Runaan's
Hurricane
,
and
Nashor's
Tooth
can
allow
his
Electrical
Surge
passive's
Mark
of
the
Storm
trigger
more
quickly.
Because
his
Electrical
Surge's
passive
damage
is
scaled
in
attack
damage.
items
like
Infinity
Edge
,
The
Black
Cleaver
,
Last
Whisper
,
and
The
Bloodthirster
are
good
items
to
utilize.
The
attack
damage
carry
build
path
is
recommended
to
players
who
are
new
in
playing
Kennen,
or
those
who
have
difficulty
landing
his
Thundering
Shuriken
skill.

Countering
When
you
have
two
stacks
of
Mark
of
the
Storm
,
move
away
from
Kennen
until
the
debuff
wears
off
to
avoid
his
stun.
Moving
erratically
or
taking
cover
behind
minions
can
hinder
you
from
getting
hit
by
his
Thundering
Shuriken
.
Do
not
overextend
when
chasing
him
as
Lightning
Rush
also
boosts
his
armor
and
magic
resistance
.
If
Kennen
chases
you
and
fails
to
hit
with
his
Lightning
Rush
,
he
won't
gain
energy.
Use
this
as
your
advantage
since
Lightning
Rush
consumes
a
lot
of
energy.
Quickly
using
a
knockback
on
Kennen
while
Slicing
Maelstrom
is
active
can
cause
him
to
waste
the
ability.
Be
aware
Zhonya's
Hourglass
is
a
common
item
on
Kennen
to
avoid
such
a
possibility.
Kennen
primarily
deals
magic
damage.
Investing
in
magic
resistance
items
will
reduce
his
damage
output.
That
said,
Kennen
can
also
be
built
as
attack
damage
carry.
Pay
attention
to
his
build
to
counter
him
properly.
For
example,
reducing
his
attack
speed
will
lower
his
damage
and
stun
output.
