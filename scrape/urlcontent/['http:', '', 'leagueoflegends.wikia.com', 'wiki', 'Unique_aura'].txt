Unique
aura
The
Aura
is
a
passive
modifier
to
units
that
are
near
the
aura
source,
which
may
be
a
champion
that
has
the
aura
thanks
to
an
ability
of
his
own
or
to
an
item
he
is
holding,
or
an
object,
which
can
only
be
placed
by
a
champion.
Some
auras
buff
allies,
increasing
their
effectiveness
in
battle,
while
others
debuff
enemies,
hindering
their
efforts
on
the
battlefield.
In
almost
all
cases
aura
effects
are
unique,
and
cannot
be
stacked.
An
exception
to
this
rule
is
in
the
event
that
multiple
champions
are
carrying
an
item
with
the
same
beneficial
aura
effect,
each
of
those
two
champions
will
receive
two
instances
of
the
aura
buff:
one
from
the
item
they
are
carrying,
and
a
second
from
the
aura
of
their
ally.
If
a
champion
is
near
both
of
the
champions
with
the
same
aura
item,
it
will
only
receive
one
instance
of
the
aura.
No
champion
can
ever
receive
more
than
two
instances
of
a
unique
benevolent
aura,
regardless
of
how
many
nearby
allies
are
providing
the
buff.
There
are
two
types
of
auras:
Global:
These
auras
have
global
range
and
grant
bonuses
to
the
allies
of
the
champion
that
carries
it.
Area
of
effect:
This
is
the
most
common
aura
type,
and
refer
to
auras
that
will
only
grant
bonuses
or
debuffs
to
units
near
the
aura
source.
These
divide
themselves
depending
on
whether
they
need
activation
or
are
persistent.
Constant:
These
auras
give
bonuses
to
allies
or
debuff
enemies
around
the
carrier
of
the
aura
constantly.
Stance:
These
auras
give
bonuses
to
allies
for
as
long
as
the
carrier
has
the
aura-granting
stance
active.
Active
:
These
auras
are
active
only
for
a
few
seconds
after
the
ability
that
grants
it
is
activated.

Notes
Sunfire
Cape
is
not
considered
an
item
that
has
an
aura
effect
because
it
does
not
apply
a
buff
to
nearby
allies
or
debuff
to
nearby
enemies.
Sunfire
Cape
applies
a
buff
only
to
the
wearer.
The
passive
effect
is
very
similar
of
how
Amumu's
Despair
and
Dr.
Mundo's
Burning
Agony
works.
Sivir's
On
The
Hunt
aura
is
mechanically
different
from
all
other
aura,
allied
bonuses
persist
even
if
a
buffed
unit
moves
out
of
range
of
Sivir.
Captain
provides
a
buff
to
allies
within
a
range
of
around
1100,
however
the
bonus
is
listed
as
a
passive
and
not
an
aura.
