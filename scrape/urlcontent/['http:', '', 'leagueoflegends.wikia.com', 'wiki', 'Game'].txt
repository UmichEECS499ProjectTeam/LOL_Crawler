League
of
Legends
(or
as
it
was
previously
known,
League
of
Legends:
Clash
of
Fates
)
is
a
multiplayer
online
battle
arena
(MOBA)
genre
video
game
developed
by
Riot
Games,
to
operate
on
the
Microsoft
Windows
operating
system.
[5]
It
was
first
announced
on
October
7th,
2008
and
released
a
year
later
on
October
27th,
2009.
[6]
The
game
was
in
beta
from
April
10th,
2009
[7]
to
October
26th,
2009.
[8]
Two
main
protagonists
for
the
popular
Warcraft
III
mod,
Defense
of
the
Ancients:
Allstars
(commonly
abbreviated
as
DotA
),
Steve
"Guinsoo"
Feak
and
Steve
"Pendragon"
Mescon
are
involved
with
Riot
Games
in
the
process
of
making
of
League
of
Legends
.
Guinsoo
created
DotA:
Allstars
from
the
original
DotA
,
created
by
Eul,
by
adding
his
own
mix
of
content,
including
over
40
heroes,
numerous
items,
and
various
gameplay
changes.
Guinsoo
then
passed
DotA:
Allstars
on
to
its
current
developer,
Icefrog.
Pendragon,
who
is
the
Director
of
Community
Relations
for
Riot
Games,
helped
create
the
DotA:
Allstars
website
along
with
its
forums,
and
is
still
currently
working
on
DotA:
Allstars
alongside
League
of

Development
The
idea
of
a
spiritual
successor
to
Defense
of
the
Ancients
that
would
be
its
own
stand-alone
game
with
its
own
engine
rather
than
another
mod
of
Warcraft
III
began
to
materialize
at
the
end
of
2005.
[9]
League
of
Legends
was
born
"when
a
couple
of
very
active
DotA
community
members
believed
that
the
gameplay
was
so
much
fun
and
so
innovative
that
it
represented
the
spawning
of
a
new
genre
and
deserved
to
be
its
own
professional
game
with
significantly
enhanced
features
and
around-game
services."
[9]
Riot
Games
was
co-founded
by
Brandon
Beck
and
Marc
Merrill.
[10]
They
partnered
with
some
of
the
key
creative
minds
behind
the
creation
of
DotA:
Allstars
,
Steve
"Guinsoo"
Feak
and
Steve
"Pendragon"
Mescon.
[9]
Riot
Games
officially
opened
its
office
in
September
2006,
and
currently
has
about
100
people
working
on
League
of
Legends
,
"including
their
robust
technology
platform
to
service
and
operate
the
game
as
well
as
a
team
dedicated
to
community
relations."
[9]
According
to
Marc
Merrill,
when
creating
the
various
champions
in
the
game,
instead
of
leaving
the
champion
creation
to
just
a
few
people,
they
decided
to
open
up
the
champion
creation
process
to
everyone
in
the
company
based
upon
a
template
where
they
could
vote
on
which
champions
made
it
into
the
game.
[11]
Gameplay
General
Players
are
formed
into
two
even
teams
of
three
or
five
players
on
each
team.
Each
team
starts
at
opposing
sides
of
a
map,
near
what
is
called
a
"
Nexus
".
To
win
a
match,
a
team
must
destroy
the
opposing
team's
Nexus.
To
do
so,
each
team
must
work
through
a
series
of
towers
called
"
turrets
".
Turrets
are
often
placed
along
a
path
to
each
base
often
referred
to
as
a
"
lane
".
Along
the
way,
each
player
gains
levels
by
killing
the
opposing
team's
"
minions
"
(small
NPCs
that
constantly
spawn
and
attack
the
other
team),
and
buy
"
items
"
to
advance
their
character.
Matchmaking
League
of
Legends
is
a
session-based
game.
Matchmaking
occurs
based
on
the
average
Elo
ratings
of
each
individual
player.
The
game
can
be
currently
played
in
four
different
modes:
normal
,
Co-op
vs.
AI
,
custom
,
or
ranked
.
In
a
normal
game,
the
server
attempts
to
match
up
players
of
equal
skill
level.
It
is
possible
to
enter
an
arranged
team
of
players,
in
which
case
the
arranged
team
is
considered
to
be
more
powerful
than
the
individual
players.
A
co-op
game
requires
you
to
team
up
with
four
other
randomly
selected
players
to
play
a
five
versus
five
match
against
a
team
of
five
randomly
selected
bots.
Custom
game
allows
players
to
create
a
session
and
set
its
properties,
or
find
an
existing
session
to
join.
Unlike
co-op,
custom
allows
you
to
make
any
range
of
teams
on
either
side
from
one
to
five.
Empty
spaces
can
be
filled
in
by
bots
or
players,
or
remain
empty.
Ranked
games
are
competitive
matches
open
only
to
players
who
have
reached
the
highest
level,
level
30.
It
features
a
draft
mode
champion
selection
process,
where
a
handful
of
champions
are
banned
before
picking
begins.
Game
Types
and
Maps
There
are
currently
two
game
modes:
Classic
and
Dominion.
The
Classic
game
mode
is
a
base
defense
in
which
one
attempts
to
gradually
battle
their
way
to
the
opponents'
Nexus
with
the
help
of
minions
,
through
turrets
and
inhibitors
.
The
Dominion
game
mode
is
a
capture
and
hold
game
in
which
players
battle
over
strategic
map
areas.
Capturing
these
areas,
and
killing
enemies
will
damage
the
opponents'
nexus
instead
of
directly
damaging
it.
Maps
in
League
of
Legends
are
called
"Fields
of
Justice".
[12]
Classic
Main
article:
Summoner's
Rift
Summoner's
Rift
resembles
the
Defense
of
the
Ancients
map
with
three
lanes
and
supports
five
players
per
side.
Main
article:
Twisted
Treeline
Twisted
Treeline
is
a
smaller
map
with
two
lanes,
and
supports
three
players
per
side.
The
maps
put
two
teams
with
a
fixed
number
of
players
against
each
other.
Each
team
has
its
base,
which
contains
the
re-spawn
point,
item
shop
and
Nexus.
The
two
bases
are
connected
by
lanes
.
Periodically,
waves
of
minions
spawn
from
the
Nexus.
Minions
are
AI-controlled
NPC's
that
move
down
the
lanes,
engaging
any
enemies
they
encounter.
The
lanes
are
lined
with
turrets
that
engage
enemies
within
range.
Once
a
turret
is
destroyed,
it
will
not
respawn.
A
new
element
in
League
of
Legends
is
the
inhibitors.
Each
lane
has
an
inhibitor
on
both
ends.
If
a
team
destroys
the
enemy
inhibitor
,
more
powerful
"
Super
Minions
"
will
spawn
for
that
side.
Unlike
turrets,
inhibitors
respawn
after
five
minutes.
Besides
the
lanes,
the
maps
also
contain
"
jungle
"
areas,
populated
with
neutral
monster
camps.
These
monsters
can
be
killed
by
a
champion
for
gold
and
experience
.
Some
"epic"
monsters
will
grant
the
killer
a
buff,
such
as
the
Ancient
Golem
on
Summoner's
Rift,
which
grants
its
killer
the
Crest
of
the
Ancient
Golem
to
help
them
in
battle.
Another
special
terrain
feature
is
the
brush
.
A
brush
blocks
the
line
of
sight
of
units,
allowing
champions
to
hide
and
set
up
a
surprise
attack,
or
"gank".
The
goal
of
each
team
is
to
destroy
the
enemy
Nexus.
The
first
team
to
achieve
this
is
the
victor.
It
is
also
possible
to
surrender
using
a
voting
system.
Dominion
Main
article:
Crystal
Scar
The
Crystal
Scar
map
is
exclusively
available
for
Dominion.
It
supports
five
players
per
side
in
a
fast
paced
game
of
capture
and
hold.
The
map
has
two
spawn
points
at
opposite
ends
of
a
circular
path
that
contains
five
control
points,
a
jungle
in
the
middle
and
is
more
focused
on
constant
combat
action
with
an
average
game
time
of
20
minutes.
The
circular
lane,
and
central
area
remains
exposed
at
all
times
to
both
teams
while
the
jungle
is
veiled
in
the
Fog
of
War
.
The
jungle
will
be
devoid
of
neutral
monsters
but
has
shrines
that
increase
movement
speed,
lesser
relics
that
restore
health
and
mana
,
and
a
pair
of
greater
relics
in
the
center
that
provide
a
powerful
buff.
A
control
point
is
taken
over
by
channeling
on
it
for
a
period
of
time
(10
seconds
to
change
alignment
from
one
state
to
another,
unless
reduced).
With
multiple
teammates,
the
time
to
required
to
take
control
is
reduced.
Any
damage
taken
from
an
enemy
champion
will
interrupt
the
channeling.
Dominion
features
a
lot
of
changes
to
the
game
that
include
starting
at
level
3,
an
increase
in
starting
gold
and
gold
income,
base
XP
generation,
reduced
respawn
time,
and
a
map-wide
aura
that
increases
mana
regeneration,
provides
base
armor/magic
penetration,
and
reduces
healing,
as
well
as
other
changes
to
make
it
a
different,
faster
paced
game.
Some
items
have
been
removed,
with
new
Dominion
specific
items
added.
One
summoner
spell
is
unavailable,
replaced
by
the
Dominion-specific
spell,
Garrison
.

Mid
Main
article:
Howling
Abyss
The
Howling
Abyss
is
exclusively
available
for
ARAM.
It
has
similar
gameplay
with
the
classic
maps
where
players
must
destroy
the
Nexus
to
win
here
with
a
few
changes.Unlike
the
classic
maps,
ARAM
only
has
one
lane
and
has
no
jungle
,
the
re-spawn
point
will
not
restore
health
or
mana
and
players
cannot
purchase
items
after
passing
the
Nexus.
Players
must
die
to
purchase
items
again.
With
the
lack
of
health
and
mana
restoration
from
the
re-spawn
point,
ARAM
features
Health
Relics
.
Like
Dominion,
players
will
begin
at
level
three,
have
an
increase
in
starting
gold
and
gold
income,
base
XP
generation,
reduced
respawn
time,
and
a
map-wide
aura
that
increases
mana
regeneration,
provides
base
armor/magic
penetration,
and
reduces
healing,
as
well
as
other
changes
to
make
it
a
different,
faster
paced
game.
Some
items
have
been
removed,
with
new
ARAM
specific
items
added.
Champions
Each
player
controls
a
single
champion
.
There
are
currently
118
different
champions
available
in
the
game,
each
with
unique
characteristics.
Certain
champions
are
tagged
with
certain
attributes
such
as
'tank',
'fighter',
'mage'
or
'support'
to
describe
their
play
style.
Champions
have
more
than
one
attribute,
and
can
be
played
in
a
variety
of
ways,
though
some
are
more
viable
than
others.
At
the
start
of
each
battle,
every
player
must
choose
a
champion
to
fight
for
him/her
in
battle.
The
choice
of
champions
is
limited
by
what
the
player
has
unlocked.
Each
week,
10
champions
are
made
temporarily
free
so
that
players
can
try
them
out
without
unlocking
them,
a
service
known
as
the
free
champion
rotation
.
Champions
gain
experience
by
killing
enemy
minions,
neutral
monsters,
champions,
or
structures.
After
reaching
a
certain
amount
of
experience,
the
champion
levels
up.
Each
level
increases
the
champion's
stats
and
adds
an
ability
point
that
can
be
spent
to
improve
one
of
the
champion's
four
unique
abilities.
Normally,
each
champion
has
three
basic
abilities
that
can
be
learnt
at
any
time,
with
a
maximum
rank
of
five
(with
some
exceptions).
They
also
have
the
ability
to
level
up
their
ultimate
ability
at
level
6,
to
a
maximum
rank
of
three.
The
maximum
level
for
a
champion
is
18.
Players
can
gain
gold
by
landing
the
killing
blow
on
an
enemy
minion/monster,
by
killing
a
champion/assisting
in
a
kill,
or
will
receive
global
gold
from
the
destruction
of
structures,
or
killing
of
some
epic
monsters.
Some
abilities
and
items
also
generate
extra
gold.
The
acquired
gold
can
be
spent
at
the
item
shop
for
various
items.
These
items
boost
stats
of
the
champion.
Some
items
can
be
combined
into
more
powerful
items
by
following
predefined
recipes.
[13]
Summoner
The
Summoner
acts
as
the
persistent
element
in
the
game.
The
summoner
has
the
ability
to
summon
champions
into
the
battle
arena,
and
have
a
mental
link
with
their
summoned
champion
.
Summoner
accounts
are
used
to
track
statistics
and
scores
for
each
player.
[14]
[15]
Summoners
gain
experience
points
and
Influence
Points
after
each
battle
they
participate
in.
They
level
up
after
receiving
enough
experience,
and
can
unlock
new
champions
and
runes
with
their
Influence
Points
.
Summoner
spells
Main
article:
Summoner
spell
The
Summoner
can
choose
two
summoner
spells
to
bring
with
them
into
the
battle.
[14]
These
spells
significantly
impact
gameplay,
and
have
a
high
cooldown
while
costing
no
mana
.
All
spells
can
be
improved
with
masteries
.
[14]
Masteries
Main
article:
Mastery
The
summoner
is
able
to
focus
their
intense
magical
training
into
three
specific
categories,
which
collectively
are
known
as
masteries.
Some
of
the
more
advanced
masteries
require
not
only
a
working
knowledge
of
previous
masteries
within
a
single
category,
but
also
the
knowledge
of
a
specific
mastery.
As
a
summoner
gains
levels
of
power
within
the
League
of
Legends,
they
are
able
to
select
which
specific
areas
of
interest
to
focus
on.
The
points
allocated
in
the
mastery
trees
can
be
changed
at
any
time
before
the
match
begins.
Runes
Main
article:
Rune
Runes
are
enhancements
that
the
player
provides
for
his
champion
before
a
match
on
a
field
of
justice
begins
to
augment
their
champion's
abilities.
Runes
can
only
be
bought
with
Influence
Points
from
the
Riot
Store
.
Each
rune
grants
a
small
bonus
in
a
specific
category,
which
stack
upon
each
other
to
grant
larger
bonuses.Runes
can't
be
sold
back
to
the
store,
but
can
be
combined.

Riot
Games
has
signed
deals
regarding
the

[16]
For

in
Europe,
Riot
Games
signed
an
international
licensing
partnership
with
GOA,
the
videogames
department
of
Orange’s
Content
Division
and
Europe’s
largest
gaming
portal
after
some
issues
with
the
European

of
the

Riot
later
decided
to
break
the
contract
with
GOA
and
self-publish

Riot
Games
self-publishes
and
operates
