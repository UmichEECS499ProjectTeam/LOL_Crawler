Ionia
versus
Noxus
:
Rematch
was
an
event
by
Riot
Games

which
ten
players
were
selected
to
play
an
official
match
that
will
affect
the
course
of
Runeterra
's
lore.
The
result
of
the
match
was
victory
for
Ionia.

Background
The
Invasion
Soon
after
Noxus
and
Demacia
signed
a
treaty
agreeing
to
settle
their
disputes
through
matches
held
by
the
young
League
of
Legends,
Noxus
turned
its
expansionistic
eye
outward.
Bolstered
by
the
forces
of
Zaun
and
Bilgewater
,
Noxian
soldiers
invaded
Ionia
in
what
became
the
bloodiest
engagement
since
the
Rune
Wars.
Rallying
its
forces,
Ionia
managed
to
halt
the
progress
of
the
invaders,
but
Noxian
forces
entrenched
themselves
in
three
of
Ionia's
southern
provinces:
Galrin,
Navori,
and
Shon-Xan.
Seeking
to
avoid
further
bloodshed,
Ionia
joined
the
League
of
Legends
and
petitioned
to
have
the
Noxians
removed
from
Ionian
soil.
The
decision
was
made
to
settle
the
matter
on
the
Fields
of
Justice
.
The
match
was
coined
"The
Trial
for
the
Isle"
and
it
captured
the
attention
of
all
of
Runeterra.
Despite
the
best
efforts
of
Ionian
champions,
Noxus
prevailed,
although
rumors
abound
that
foul
play
was
involved.
Noxus
was
granted
the
right
to
maintain
its
occupation
of
the
Ionian
provinces,
and
no
appeal
of
the
decision
could
be
made
for
fifteen
years.
The
Protest
See:
Issue
7
and
Issue
8
Seven
years
later,
on
the
twelfth
of
October,
20
CLE,
a
single
Shojin
monk
shocked
the
world
when
he
traveled
to
Ionia’s
Lotus
Gardens
and
set
fire
to
himself
in
protest
of
the
Noxian
occupation.
He
channeled
inner
magic
to
preserve
himself
in
a
state
of
perpetual
agony
while
ablaze
in
the
garden,
and
he
will
remain
there
until
the
last
leaf
falls
from
the
sacred
bonsai
resting
next
to
him.
Almost
immediately,
there
was
a
public
outcry
for
the
League
to
reconsider
its
ruling.
Moved
to
action,
many
of
Ionia’s
most
notable
figures
spoke
out,
demanding
an
early
rematch.
The
Rematch
See:
Issue
9
,
Issue
10
and
Issue
11
In
uncharacteristic
fashion,
Noxus
offered
Ionia
an
early
rematch,
putting
to
rest
concerns
that
Ionia
might
betray
its
agreement
to
abide
by
the
League’s
previous
ruling.
Ionia
accepted
Noxus'
offer,
and
the
two
city-states
entered
negotiations
to
solidify
the
stakes
of
the
match.
It
was
ultimately
determined
that
if
Ionia
wins,
Noxus
must
withdraw
its
forces
in
full,
and
immediately
halt
any
and
all
extraction
of
Ionian
resources.
However,
should
Noxus
prevail,
Ionia
must
completely
surrender
the
southern
provinces
to
the
nation
of
Noxus,
and
furnish
one
Noxian
designee
with
a
seat
amongst
the
Ionian
Elders.
This
would
give
Noxus
a
voice
and
ear
inside
the
government
of
Ionia.
Preliminary
analyses
indicate
that
this
rematch
may
be
the
most
highly
anticipated
event
in
all
of
League
history.
The
Battle
The
Date
of
the
match
has
been
decided,
10
December,
20
CLE.
Summoner's
Rift.
The
battle
begins
at
6:00
PM,
Pacific
Standard
Time.
Five
summoners
representing
Ionia
will
meet
five
summoners
representing
Noxus
in
a
single
battle
to
determine
the
fate
of
Ionia.
The
event
will
be
livestreamed
and
shoutcast
by
the
official
League
commentator,
Phreak!

on
the
livestream

Aftermath
After
the
victory
of
the
Ionian
Summoners
there
were
various
consequences:
A
new
item:
Ionian
Boots
of
Lucidity
,
for
the
Fields
of
Justice
in-game
store.
The
three
provinces
of
Ionia
were
given
back
from
the
Noxian
control.
The
Riot
Store
offered
the
Ionian
Champions
at
half
price.
The
Contenders
The
League
has
approved
ten
champions
for
each
side.
Each
team
will
have
the
opportunity
to
ban
one
champion
from
entry
into
the
battle.
Each
side
will
then
commence
with
a
draft
until
each
side
has
selected
a
team
of
five.

It

odds
of

for

The
Fate
of
Ionia
The
fate
of
Ionia
hangs
in
the
balance.
Should
the
enlightened
city-state
of
Ionia
conquer
their
oppressors,
Noxus
has
agreed
to
withdraw
from
the
island.
The
provinces
of
Galrin,
Navori,
and
Shon-Xan
in
southern
Ionia
will
be
liberated,
a
freedom
they
have
not
tasted
in
years.
Should
the
powerful
city-state
of
Noxus
emerge
the
victor,
the
three
southern
provinces
currently
being
occupied
by
Noxus
will
become
permanently
governed
under
Noxian
rule.
As
per
the
governance
of
Ionia,
the
provinces
will
be
represented
by
selected
dukes
and
duchesses,
which
hold
court
in
the
Convergence
of
Elders,
Ionia's
governmental
assembly.
All
decisions
made
in
the
Convergence
of
Elders
will
thus
include
Noxian
voices
in
the
fray.
Rewards
The
League's
Vault
The
summoners
representing
the
winning
city-states
will
be
honored
with
a
supervised
visit
to
the
Arcanum
Vault,
located
underneath
the
Institute
of
War.
They
will
be
the
first
city-state
affiliated
summoners
to
be
allowed
access
to
the
Vault.
They
will
be
presented
with
two
items
and
granted
the
privilege
to
select
one
to
be
added
to
shop
shelves
on
the
Fields
of
Justice.
The
item
will
be
named
in
honor
of
the
victor.
The
two
items
that
the
League
has
selected
are
a
pair
of
boots
and
an
item
from
the
famed
artificer
Doran's
collection.
Both
items
grant
unique
abilities
compared
to
the
existing
boots
and
Doran's
items
currently
available.
The
item
selected
for
sale
will
be
dedicated
in
the
winning
city-state's
honor.
(Side
note.
Guardsman
Bob
has
said
on
stream
that
the
second
item
was
a
Doran's
item
for
casters
which
had
a
small
percentage
of
spell
vamp,
however
he
voted
for
the
other
one
because
he
dislikes
the
mechanic)
