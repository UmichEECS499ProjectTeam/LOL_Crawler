Strategy
The
Ionian
Boots
of
Lucidity
are
a
favoured
choice
on
AD
casters,
who
prefer
the
CDR
to
the
attack
speed
of
the
other
main
offensive
AD
boot
choice,
the
Berserker's
Greaves
,
and
don't
tend
to
get
as
much
CDR
from
their
other
items
as
mages
(who
for
this
reason
tend
to
buy
Sorcerer's
Shoes
instead).
Many
supports
also
pick
up
these
boots,
as
their
utility
to
their
team
tends
to
come
in
a
large
part
from
their
abilities.
Ionian
Boots
of
Lucidity
are
the
only
item
that
grants
an
amount
of
cooldown
reduction
that
isn't
a
multiple
of
10,
making
it
work
well
with
Sorcery
.
It
can
be
used
to
reach
the
CDR
cap
of
40%
without
cooldown
reduction
runes
or
buying
extraneous
cooldown
reduction.
Lore
The
Boots
of
Lucidity
were
introduced
as
the
item
that
honors
the
Ionian
Victory
in
their
rematch
with
Noxus
.
