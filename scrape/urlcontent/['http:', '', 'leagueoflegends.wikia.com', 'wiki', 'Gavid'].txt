Gavid,
the
Plant
Kìng
was
cancelled
due
to
not
fitting
within
the
League
of
Legends
artistic
theme.
On
the
map
for
the
2010
Harrowing
,
a
coffin
can
be
seen
on
the
extreme
lower
right
with
him
in
it.
This
could
be
the
subtle
"nail-in-the-coffin"
confirming
his
cancellation.

Although
no

here

Trivia
The
ability
icon
for
Animate
Vitalis
has
been
reused
for
the
Crest
of
Nature's
Fury
buff,
which
is
obtained
from
killing
the
Rabid
Wolf
on
The
Twisted
Treeline
.
The
icon
for
Animate
Entangler
was
also
reused
for
the
debuff
from
Baron
Nashor's
ability
Wrath
of
the
Ancients
.
Zyra's
ability
kit
closely
mirrors
the
icons
and
theming
of
the
Plant
King's
abilities,
only
missing
a
corresponding
Animate
Vitalis
ability.
