Hotkeys
are
keys

key
combinations
for
use
within
a
match
which,
when
pressed,
provide
quick
access
to
certain

of
the
game.
Commands
can

typed
into
the
chat
console
either
within
a
match,
or
in

as
champion
laughter,
jokes,
and
dances)
will
only
have
the
specified
effect
within
a
match.

PvP.net
provides
players
with
the
ability
to
chat
with
friends
who
are
currently
in
an
active
session
of
League
of
Legends
.
For
players
in
the
AIR
client,
this
process
is
as
simple
as
opening
a
chat
window
through
your
buddy
list.
Players
in-game
will
be
able
to
send
messages
to
players
in
the
PvP.net
client,
or
even
in
other
games
of
League
of
Legends
by
making
use
of
the
following
chat
commands,
followed
by
a
message:
Command
Description
/w
or
/msg
"summoner
name"
Will
send
a
message
to
another
player.
Summoner
names
are
case
sensitive.
/r
Will
send
a
message
to
the
last
player
who
sent
you
a
message.
Note
that
it
will
automatically
add
the
recipient
after
/r
.
/all
Will
send
a
message
to
all
players
in
the
current
match
(useful
if
you
forgot
to
press
shift
+
enter).
PvP.net

of
the
following
commands:
Command
Description
/mute
"summoner

mute
all
text
from
a
player
for
the
duration
of
your
current
game
session.
/ignore

Will
mute
a

during
this
game
session
and
all
subsequent
game
sessions.
File
Location
for
Keybindings
Please
read
this
section
completely
if
you
want
to
change
this
file.
It
can
mess
up
your
keybindings
if
not
done
properly
and
it
is
wise
to
test
the
changes
in
a
tutorial
game
before
using
them
in
a
real
game...
ALWAYS
BACK
UP
THE
FILE!
The
file
that
holds
the
keybindings
can
be
found
here:
*\League
of
Legends\Config\input.ini
Some
people
have
trouble
changing
the
keybindings
through
the
in-game
interface.
Editing
this
file
is
an
alternate
way
of
changing
your
keybindings.
In
particular,
the
game
UI
forbids
assigning
Shift
modified
key-bindings
to
the
basic
champion
abilities,
so
editing
the
file
is
the
only
way
to
achieve
this.
If
the
file
does
not
exist
it
means
that
you
have
not
changed
your
keybindings
yet.
If
so,
you
can
make
a
new
file
in
the
aforementioned
folder
and
name
it
"input.ini",
although
it
is
recommended
that
you
go
into
a
practice
game
and
modify
some
keybinds
instead
so
you
can
be
sure
you're
editing
the
correct
file.
Another
thing
to
note
is
that
it's
wise
to
test
your
keychanges
in
a
tutorial
game
and
if
it
does
not
work,
go
to
the
in-game
menu
for
keybindings
and
press
the
"reset
to
default"
button,
or
end
the
tutorial
game
and
delete
the
"input.ini"
file.
Below
is
a
list
of
the
items
that
can
be
changed.
Be
aware
that
the
header
shown
in
bold
MUST
be
present.
Also,
it
is
not
necessary
to
include
all
items,
just
the
ones
you
want
to
change.
So
for
example
if
you
want
to
switch
around
the
smartcast
and
normal
cast
keybindings,
you
just
use
the
evtCastSpell1
through
evtCastAvatarSpell2
section
and
the
evtSmartCastSpell1
through
the
evtSmartCastAvatarSpell2
section.
Any
items
not
explicitly
mentioned

As
of
the
Skarner
patch
(V1.0.0.123),
there
is
now
a
new
keybinding
available:
Smart
+
Self
Cast
.
This
new
setup
is
nearly
identical
to
the
old
smartcast
except
in
one
regard:
spells
that
you
can
target
on
yourself
you
can
now
cast
to
yourself
by
pressing
the
key
with
the
mouse
over
any
invalid
target.
For
example,
with
this
setup
you
can
apply
Morgana's
Black
Shield
to
yourself
by
pressing
the
self
+
smartcast
key
and
having
your
mouse
over
anything
that
is
not
an
allied
champion.
For
those
of
you
who
want
to
edit
the
input.ini
file,
here
is
an
example
of
self
+
smartcast
applied
to
the
standard
keys:
Code
[GameEvents]
evtSmartPlusSelfCastSpell4
=
[r]
evtSmartPlusSelfCastSpell3
=
[e]
evtSmartPlusSelfCastSpell2
=
[w]
evtSmartPlusSelfCastSpell1
=
[q]
evtSmartPlusSelfCastAvatarSpell1
=
[d]
evtSmartPlusSelfCastAvatarSpell2
=
[f]
evtCastSpell4
=
[r][Shift]
evtCastSpell3
=
[e][Shift]
evtCastSpell2
=
[w][Shift]
evtCastSpell1
=
[q][Shift]
evtCastAvatarSpell1
=
[d][Shift]
evtCastAvatarSpell2
=
[f][Shift]
Switching
primary
and
secondary
mouse
buttons
LoL
does
not
support
the
setting
within
operating
systems
that
switch
primary
and
secondary
buttons,
nor
does
it
allow
the
changing
of
these
within
the
in-game
client.
To
switch
these
buttons
you
must
use
the
following

(which

omitted
from
the
previous
example).

Casting

binds
will
first
try
to
smart
cast
the

no
longer
move
you
in
the
direction
of
your
ally.
Ignoring
or
muting
a
user
will
now
also
ignore
their
minimap
pings.
V1.0.0.83
:
The
HUD
can
now
be
hidden
using
Alt+[-].
Responding
using
the
"/r"
function
will
now
correctly
respond
to
the
most
recent
person
that
whispered
you.
The
mouse
wheel
can
now
be
used
to
scroll
up
and
down
in
the
shop.
