Victory
for
Ionia
Ionia
reclaims
southern
conquered
lands
in
a
stunning
victory
over
Noxus
Aria
Breker
reporting
from
Ionia
Udyr
and
Ashe
,
defending
for
Ionia
,
ambush
Miss
Fortune
for
the
first
kill
of
the
battle.
The
fervor
of
Ionia
’s
stand
for
freedom
proved
to
be
an
unstoppable
force
two
weeks
ago
when
Ionian
summoners
crushed
the
Noxian
occupiers
in
a
stunning
upset
on
Summoner's
Rift
.
This
decisive
victory
allowed
Ionia
to
reclaim
its
southern
provinces
from
Noxus
.
The
first
kill
of
the
match
was
a
joint
effort
by
Udyr
and
Ashe
,
summoned
by
Guardsman
Bob
and
Frozt.
Ashe’s
arrow
met
its
mark
to
strike
the
killing
blow
on
Miss
Fortune
as
she
was
ambushed
in
the
center
lane.
Continued
Ionian
efforts
to
surprise
Vladimir
,
summoned
by
Poisonidon,
failed
as
he
evaded
the
attacks
by
bearing
the
pain
of
several
sanguine
pools.
Morgana
and
Singed
,
linked
to
summoners
Vorath
and
Friend,
ferociously
pressed
the
advance
in
bottom
lane.
In
response,
summoners
NeoIllusions
and
Poruku
put
up
a
solid
defense
with
their
champions
Amumu
and
Soraka
.
Ionian
defenders
Kennen
-
guided
by
summoner
Eclipse
-
and
Amumu
proved
to
be
an
instrumental
maelstrom
of
stuns
and
damage
in
every
team
fight.
Summoner
Edwy,
guiding
Sion
on
the
Noxus
team,
made
valiant
efforts
to
halt
Ionia’s
advance,
throwing
himself
into
the
fray
at
one
point
in
an
attempt
to
stop
the
Ionian
team
from
slaying
the
dragon
.
During
a
shocking
moment
during
the
match,
summoner
Poisonidon’s
link
with
Noxian
champion
Vladimir
was
lost,
causing
the
battlefield
to
erupt
with
confusion.
During
the
interruption,
the
Ionians
respectfully
called
a
halt
to
the
battle
until
Poisonidon
was
able
to
re-link
with
his
champion.
The
League
launched
an
immediate
investigation
into
whether
foul
play
was
at
hand
with
the
disconnection,
but
it
was
ruled
that
there
was
no
ulterior
motive
from
either
side.
In
the
match’s
final
moments,
Roku,
the
summoner
for
Miss
Fortune,
along
with
the
rest
of
the
Noxian
team,
mounted
a
noble
last
stand
against
their
impending
defeat.
Miss
Fortune
exacted
revenge
for
giving
up
the
first
kill
when
she
successfully
slayed
the
unstoppable
Udyr
with
help
from
her
team.
However,
the
Noxian
defense
was
ultimately
overwhelmed
by
the
zealous
Ionians
when
Soraka
led
the
final
push
to
destroy
the
nexus
in
the
Noxian
base.
It
was
a
bittersweet
end
to
the
match,
with
Soraka
avenging
her
poor
performance
during
the
original
match
for
Ionia.
In
the
“Trial
for
the
Isle”
seven
years
ago,
Soraka
was
ruthlessly
targeted
by
Warwick
and
Singed,
both
having
the
insult
of
Soraka’s
curse
of
lycanthropy
fresh
on
their
minds.
The
League
unanimously
voted
Ionian
summoner
Guardsman
Bob
and
League
champion
Udyr
as
the
MVPs
of
the
match
for
both
their
bravery
and
masterful
control
of
the
jungle.
After
the
battle’s
conclusion,
the
victorious
summoners
were
escorted
to
the
Arcanum
Vault,
which
is
a
holding
room
for
esoteric
magical
items
secured
by
the
League.
The
Ionian
team
was
presented
with
two
items
for
entry
onto
the
Fields
of
Justice.
They
selected
the
Ionian
Boots
of
Lucidity
,
an
item
that
grants
its
wearers
movement
speed
and
cooldown
reduction
during
battle.
The
item
is
moving
through
the
final
stages
of
preparation
and
will
soon
be
introduced
to
the
Fields
of
Justice
in
honor
of
the
victors.
Noxian
forces
have
begun
their
withdrawal
from
Ionia’s
southern
provinces,
with
the
citizens
of
Galrin,
Navori,
and
Shon-Xan
erupting
in
celebration
prior
to
their
occupiers
vacating
completely.
These
regions
have
been
cut
off
from
the
rest
of
Ionia
for
7
years,
and
Ionians
from
all
over
the
island
have
descended
upon
the
regions
to
share
food,
supplies,
and
support
during
a
tumultuous
withdrawal.
Tearful
reunions
between
long-separated
families
are
a
common
sight
throughout
Ionia.
Citizens
from
all
over
Ionia
gathered
in
droves
at
the
Lotus
Gardens.
They
anxiously
awaited
the
fate
of
the
burning
monk
from
the
Shojin
Monastery,
who
incited
the
protest
by
setting
himself
aflame.
With
the
match
having
drawn
to
a
conclusion
almost
two
months
to
the
day
since
he
set
himself
on
fire,
the
bonsai
at
the
monk’s
side
—a
symbol
of
his
remaining
life
force
--
had
dwindled
down
to
its
last
two
leaves.
It
was
only
when
the
monk
was
greeted
by
his
sister
from
the
liberated
province
of
Galrin
that
he
allowed
the
flame
to
be
extinguished.
His
brethren
hastened
the
monk’s
blistered
body
swiftly
back
to
the
monastery
for
treatment.
While
it
was
clear
that
he
would
survive,
the
monk
had
suffered
the
loss
of
his
eyes,
along
with
other
severe
injuries
from
the
intense
heat.
The
invasion,
occupation,
protest,
and
finally
liberation
in
this
long
chapter
of
Ionia’s
history
closes
not
a
moment
too
soon,
with
the
Time
of
Snowdown
now
descended
upon
Valoran.
Ionia’s
liberation
is
indeed
a
capstone
to
a
truly
monumental
year
in
the
world
of
Runeterra
.
Zaun
Bribery
in
Kalamanda
Exposed
City-state
removed
from
candidacy
for
exclusive
mining
agreement
Auras
Lam
reporting
from
Kalamanda
Brandis
Reyes,
a
senior
member
of
the
Kalamanda
Village
Council,
was
ousted
Friday
after
he
was
found
to
be
taking
bribes
from
the
city-state
of
Zaun
.
An
investigation
by
Kalamanda
officials
began
after
a
large
amount
of
runes,
gems,
and
techmaturgical
devices
was
found
scattered
across
Reyes’
desk
late
last
week.
The
valuables
were
found
to
contain
trace
amounts
of
pollutants,
and
the
compositions
of
these
pollutants
allowed
Kalamanda
authorities
to
trace
the
valuables’
origins
to
Zaun.
Despite
Reyes’
claims
that
he
was
being
framed,
further
investigation
revealed
that
Reyes
had
been
soliciting
other
council
members
in
an
attempt
to
influence
them
in
Zaun’s
favor
for
the
exclusive
mining
agreement
currently
under
consideration
in
Kalamanda.
As
a
result
of
the
attempted
bribery,
the
council
has
ruled
to
exclude
Zaun
from
the
pool
of
eligible
candidates.
Mayor
Anson
Ridley
made
the
following
comment
regarding
the
ruling:
“We
have
made
it
quite
clear
to
all
interested
parties
that
Kalamanda
is
looking
for
partners
who
have
our
best
interests
in
mind.
It
is
obvious
now
that
Zaun
has
no
interest
in
a
considerate,
fair,
and
mutual
partnership
with
our
village.”
This
latest
development
comes
as
no
surprise
to
the
general
populace
of
Kalamanda.
It
is
well
known
amongst
Runeterrans
that
both
espionage
and
sabotage
are
considered
business
as
usual
in
Zaun.
Kalamanda
has
been
on
edge
due
to
the
recent
influx
of
city-states
striking
camp
along
its
borders,
and
the
rising
tension
between
the
city-states
of
Demacia
and
Noxus
has
been
causing
the
most
unease.
In
an
attempt
to
keep
the
city-state
rivalries
in
check
while
ensuring
the
prosperity
of
Kalamanda,
the
council
agreed
to
secure
an
exclusive
mining
agreement
with
a
single
city-state.
Since
then,
the
city-states
have
been
competing
vehemently
for
the
contract.
Though
Zaun’s
presence
in
Kalamanda
is
relatively
small,
it
is
speculated
that
Zaun
is
turning
the
greatest
profit
due
to
its
rampant
usage
of
techmaturgical
devices
to
extract
the
precious
minerals.
Mining
devices
are
being
invented
and
deployed
day
and
night
from
the
Zaunite
camp.
Much
to
the
concern
of
the
village
residents,
the
environment
in
the
immediate
area
already
shows
signs
of
decay,
with
a
circle
of
dying
and
mutated
vegetation
widening
daily
around
the
Zaunite
camps.
Residents
are
blaming
Zaun’s
careless
usage
of
toxic
chemicals,
unsafe
magic,
and
experimental
machinery.
However,
with
no
formal
guidelines
in
place
for
camp
inhabitants
due
to
the
rapid
influx
of
activity
within
the
city,
the
village
finds
itself
at
the
mercy
of
Zaunite
operations.
Speculations
run
rampant
that
this
may
harm
the
viability
of
Noxus’
bid
for
the
exclusive
contract,
as
Noxus
and
Zaun
are
well-known
allies.
The
nature
in
which
the
bribery
was
discovered
also
points
to
possible
involvement
from
other
city-states
currently
vying
for
the
exclusive
contract.
Kalamanda
officials
are
in
the
process
of
considering
banning
Zaun
from
mining
within
its
borders
entirely.
A
decision
is
expected
within
the
week.

Shaco?
Ram
Steed
your
eye
inside
the
League
of
Legends
As
usual,
this
reporter
brings
you
the
best
behind
the
scenes
coverage
of
the
League
of
Legends.
Today,
things
certainly
heat
up
with
this
very
spicy
edition
of
the
Eye
Inside!
More
Morgana!
Sports
Exposed,
Valoran's
leading
magazine
covering
the
competitive
sports
of
the
world,
puts
out
its
highly
anticipated
swimsuit
issue
once
a
year.
Usually,
this
fine
volume
introduces
new
models
to
the
world,
while
also
highlighting
the
cream
of
the
crop.
From
time
to
time,
they
even
have
celebrities
joining
in
on
the
fun.
This
year's
featured
celebrity
and
cover
girl
is
none
other
than
League
of
Legends
champion
Morgana,
the
Fallen
Angel
!
No
one
saw
this
coming.
This
reporter
had
the
privilege
of
being
on
set
for
one
of
her
photo
shoots.
It
pays
to
have
fans
in
high
places.
Morgana
was,
unsurprisingly,
quite
forthcoming
with
whatever
was
on
her
mind.
“As
I
expose
myself,
I
will
expose
the
truth.
By
showing
my
scars
from
war,
I
show
the
history
of
my
people.
The
Judicator
lies!
The
tyrants
that
rule
my
world
will
enslave
all
that
is
within
their
grasp.
It
is
only
a
matter
of
time
before
they
spill
out
here
into
Valoran.
If
this
is
the
way
to
get
my
message
out,
then
so
be
it.”
This
reporter
stands
stunned.
Never
would
I
have
thought
that
swimsuit
modeling
could
become
a
political
platform,
but
Morgana's
words
have
moved
me
in
a
way
this
reporter
would
originally
have
found
impossible.
All
while
wearing
something
sheer
and
purple,
while
smelling
of
tanning
oil.
Imagine
what
she'll
do
when
she
gets
back
to
the
League!
Whoops!
Here's
Janna!
Not
so
long
ago,
this
reporter
brought
to
light
an
embarrassing
event
that
captured
Valoran’s
attention.
The
beloved
and
glamorous
Janna
got
caught
in
a
nasty
scandal
when
a
dishonest
ex-boyfriend
leaked
private
bedroom
photos
of
The
Storm.
Despite
the
best
efforts
of
both
Janna's
people
and
the
League
of
Legends
public
relations
crew,
these
compromising
pictures
of
Janna
are
still
in
circulation.
As
this
reporter
knows
well,
once
something
has
been
leaked
to
the
world,
it
stays
in
the
world!
Though
Janna's
standard
battle
outfit
is
rather
revealing,
polls
show
that
this
Champion
has
become
a
favorite
of
many
with
more
traditional
values.
To
show
the
world
that
she
is
still
worthy
of
their
adoration,
Janna
has
chosen
to
take
on
a
good-will
tour
to
help
with
the
poverty-stricken
areas
of
Zaun
that
she
once
called
home.
Janna
had
this
to
say:
“As
a
public
figure,
I
have
come
to
realize
that
I
no
longer
have
a
private
life.
I
am
undertaking
this
quest
to
remind
people
that
I
am
still
the
same
person
they
have
come
to
love
and
support,
and
to
remind
myself
to
be
that
person
in
every
situation.”
All
this
over
a
couple
lousy
lingerie
shots?
Wow,
people,
wake
up!
Get
over
it!
You
only
wish
you
looked
that
good!
Dear
Mr.
Steed
The
cavalcade
of
fan
communication
continues!
“Greetings
Ram
Steed
–
Being
my
idol
and
role-model,
the
elusive
jester
Shaco
and
his
life
interest
me
greatly.
Could
it
be
possible
for
you
to
find
him
and
ask
for
an
interview?
I'm
dying
to
hear
from
him!
He
must
have
times
when
he
feels
like
sharing
his
adventures
with
someone.
Shaco,
you're
my
hero!"
-
Stimraug
Dying
to
hear
from
him?
I
certainly
hope
that's
a
pun!
More
to
the
point,
I
hope
that
Shaco
doesn't
read
that.
He
can
be
so
literal
sometimes.
Well,
brother
Stimraug,
you
have
spoken,
and
this
reporter
will
deliver.
For
the
next
issue,
I,
Ram
Steed,
will
brave
the
very
depths
of
insanity,
the
darkest
places
of
the
League
of
Legends
,
to
get
you
an
exclusive
interview
with
the
mysterious
and
deadly
Shaco,
the
world's
first
fully-functioning
homicidal
comic.
This
may
be
one
of
the
bravest
things
I
have
ever
done,
for
the
very
idea
chills
me
to
the
bone,
but
this
reporter
is
a
man
of
the
people.
Such
a
sacrifice
is
something
I
am
willing
to
take
on
without
hesitation!
So
keep
your
eye
here
for
the
next
issue
for
news
on
the
The
Demon
Jester
(or
my
obituary).
Hopefully
the
former!
If
these
be
my
last
words,
then
let
them
be
the
words
by
which
I
lived
–
The
Truth
Will
Come
Out!
If
you've
got
something
to
say
to
Ram
Steed,
mail
me
personally
at
the
Journal.
Some
infernal
techmaturgical
machine
will
get
your
message
and
pass
it
on
to
me.
The
Mailbag

Justice
Reader
mail
from
all
across
Valoran
-
answered!
Senior
Summoner
Ralston
Farnsley
commenting
from
the
Institute
of
War
The
Ionia-Noxus
Rematch
has
generated
tremendous
excitement
from
summoners
all
over
Runeterra.
In
the
wake
of
the
match,
we
would
like
to
congratulate
Ionia
for
their
decisive
victory
over
the
forces
of
Noxus.
I
wonder
if
we
may
see
some
internal
changes
in
the
Noxian
High
Command
due
to
this
crushing
defeat.
And
now
to
the
mail!
"In
the
most
recent
Journal
of
Justice
article
'General
Du
Couteau
Vanishes',
I
noticed
that
allusions
to
General
Du
Couteau’s
youngest
daughter
Cassiopeia
were
made.
Is
it
known
if
Katarina
and
Cassiopeia
are
full
blood
relatives?
Or
merely
half-sisters?"
-
Summoner
Gazzi
Unfortunately
for
Cassiopeia,
this
is
a
question
that
will
likely
be
asked
quite
a
bit
going
forward.
Katarina
and
Cassiopeia
are
full-blooded
sisters,
and
the
General
and
his
wife
have
been
happily
married
(and
faithful)
to
each
other
for
nearly
three
decades.
Katarina
distinguished
herself
early
as
the
tomboy
of
the
family,
embracing
a
military
training
regimen
while
she
was
still
a
child.
Cassiopeia
was
noted
for
her
enchanting
beauty,
and
she
took
on
an
ambassadorial
role
until
she
was...changed.
We
haven’t
pressed
her
with
questions
surrounding
her
transformation,
but
it
seems
safe
to
say
it
was
at
unwelcome
(at
least
initially).
Our
thoughts
go
out
to
the
Du
Couteau
family,
as
the
General’s
whereabouts
remain
unknown.
"So...would
you
be
so
kind
to
tell
me
something
about
Karthus'
pre-lich
life
and,
perhaps,
about
his
political
(or
whatever
else)
ambitions?
It
is
also
very
interesting
to
know
about
Karthus’s
connection
to
music,
as
he
is
famous
for
singing
some
deadly
ballads
at
Howling
Marsh,
not
to
mention
his
nickname.
I
am
sure
that
official
dossier
on
Karthus
don’t
correspondent
to
the
true
facts
that
are
in
the
Institute
of
War
disposal."

Loyso,
Dark
Arts
researcher
Unfortunately,
we
don’t
know
much
more
about
the
lich
than
you
do.
He
is
something
of
a
recluse,
and
his
past
isn’t
a
matter
of
public
record.
I
did
pull
him
aside
after
a
recent
League
match
to
see
if
he
would
lend
any
further
insight.
The
answer
he
gave
was
as
cryptic
as
his
past,
though
perhaps
more
illuminating
than
anything
else
we’ve
heard.
"In
life,
there
was
one
worth
singing
for
forever.
I
have
kept
my
promise,
though
to
some
now
the
song
is
not
as
lovely
as
it
was
once
meant
to
be."
"I
would
like
to
express
my
gratitude
for
the
privilege
at
being
able
to
speak
with
L.B.
Briskes
during
the
Ionian
celebration
to
celebrate
Irelia's
induction
as
a
champion
of
the
League.
Also,
please
let
him
know
he
doesn't
have
to
be
so
sour
about
everything.
I
mean
in
regards
to
his
latest
article,
I
would
just
like
to
tell
him
that
there
are
some
things
that
you
just
need
to
enjoy
without
a
hint
of
a
sardonic
edge
or
cynical
view."

Dracorya,
Ionian
Summoner
It
brings
me
a
certain
joy
to
forward
this
sort
of
feedback
to
the...
eccentric
Mr.
Briskes.
To
my
great
surprise,
he
furnished
me
with
a
response
this
afternoon.
"Count
yourself
fortuitous.
When
the
help
in
the
mailroom
said
I
had
some
mail,
I’d
assumed
it
was
one
of
the
usual:
threats,
subpoenas,
or
homebrewed
explosives
which
people
seem
to
think
I
don’t
have
interns
open
for
me.
Thus,
the
odds
of
me
reading
your
letter
were
understandably
slim.
However,
as
I
stumbled
into
the
office
this
morning,
my
arrival
was
timed
in
perfect
harmony
with
an
updraft
that
happened
to
reach
the
skirt
of
the
same
intern
I
typically
have
“quality
check”
my
suspicious
packages.
This
sight
put
me
in
just
the
mood
to
rifle
through
a
couple
missives
as
opposed
to
the
typical
straight-to-fireplace
approach
I
prefer
to
employ.
Your
points
were
well-taken.
In
an
earnest
attempt
to
reduce
my
'sour',
I
have
deprived
my
whiskey
of
it,
and
I
must
say:
it’s
just
fine.
Thank
you
much
for
the
thought
and
enjoy
your
Time
of
Snowdown!"
