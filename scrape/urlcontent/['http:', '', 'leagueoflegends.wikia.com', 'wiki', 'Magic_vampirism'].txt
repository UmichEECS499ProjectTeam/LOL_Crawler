Spell
vamp
is
an
offensive
stat
that
converts
a
percentage
of
the
ability
damage
dealt
to
health
regained.
Activated
abilities
that
do
not
state
they
"apply
on-hit
effects"
or
modify
your
"next
basic
attack"
will
benefit
from
spell
vamp.
[1]
Spell
vamp
works
off
of
activated
item
effects,
summoner
spells,
and
abilities,
regardless
of
the
type
of
damage
done.
It
is
calculated
from
the
damage
dealt
to
the
enemy
after
reductions
such
as
magic
resistance
,
armor
or
effects
like
Unbreakable
Will
.

Ability

Note:
These
abilities
will
heal
the
champion
by
a
percentage
of
the
damage
dealt
from
their
ability.
These
act
similar
to
how
spell
vamp
works,
but
unlike
it,
they
have
no
penalty
for
being
AoE
abilties.
Fiddlesticks's

radius.

/

/
125

if
he
has
more

Notes
Spirit
Visage
passive
effect
will
increase
spell
vamp
effectiveness.
Abilities
with
natural
spell
vamp
have
their
own
spell
vamp
fully
stacking
with
items,
runes
and
masteries
that
provide
spell
vamp.
Spell
vamp
applies
to
all
types
of
damage:
magic,
physical
and
true.
There
is
a
common
misconception
it
only
applies
to
magic
damage,
which
is
not
true.
Spell
vamp
applies
to
nearly
everything
that
isn't
classified
as
an
auto-attack.
This
is
most
abilities,
but
also
includes
items
(e.g.
Hextech
Gunblade
)
and
summoner
spells
(e.g.
Smite
).
On-hit
damage
modifiers
(e.g.
Siphoning
Strike
,
aka
"bonus"
or
"additional"
damage),
on-hit
damage
over
time
(e.g.
Seastone
Trident
and
Toxic
Shot
)
and
abilities
that
apply
on-hit
effects
(e.g.
Parrrley
and
Mystic
Shot
)
are
classified
as
auto-attacks,
and
will
not
apply
spell
vamp.
Any
physical
damage
dealt
will
trigger
life
steal,
while
any
magic
and
true
damage
dealt
trigger
neither
life
steal
nor
spell
vamp.
The
life
steal
given
by
Warwick's
Infinite
Duress
will
heal
off
of
on-hit
magic
damage.
A
list
of
champion
abilities
on-hit
effects
that
trigger
spell
vamp
can
be
found
here.
Area
of
effect
(AoE)
spells
only
apply
33%
of
the
listed
spell
vamp.
Some
abilities
as
Fox-Fire
are
classified
as
multiple
single-target
projectiles,
and
will
apply
100%
of
your
spell
vamp.
Whether
an
ability
is
classified
as
such
is
case-by-case.
For
example,
Hextech
Micro-Rockets
is
classified
as
AoE
despite
being
similar
to
Fox-Fire
.
Abilities
with
both
single-target
and
multi-target
effects,
such
as
Mace
of
Spades
and
Lay
Waste
,
will
apply
spell
vamp
depending
on
which
effect
occurs.
In
that,
full
spell
vamp
against
a
single
target;
or
33%
against
multiple
targets.
Single
target
abilities
that
apply
splash
damage
will
apply
full
spell
vamp
to
the
original
target,
and
33%
to
the
splash
damage.
For
example,
Conflagration
with
Blaze
and
Desperate
Power
.
Damage
over
time
abilities
(DoT)
apply
full
spell
vamp.
(e.g.
Brand's
Blaze
and
Malzahar's
Malefic
Visions
).
Does
not
work
with
the
reflected
damage
of
Thornmail
.
It
does,
however,
work
with
the
reflected
damage
of
Molten
Shield
and
Defensive
Ball
Curl
.
Healing
reduction
effects
like
Ignite
,
Executioner's
Calling
and
Morellonomicon
reduce
the
health
restored
by
spell
vamp.
See
healing
reduction
for
more
information.
Calculations
Spell
vamp
is
multiplied
by
total
spell
damage
to
determine
the
amount
of
health
restored.
Area
of
effect
spells,
however,
only
heal
one-third
the
normal
amount.
Examples:
Dealing
300
single-target
damage
with
10%
spell
vamp
will
heal
for
30.
Dealing
300
area
of
effect
damage
with
10%
spell
vamp
will
heal
for
10
for
each
enemy
affected.
