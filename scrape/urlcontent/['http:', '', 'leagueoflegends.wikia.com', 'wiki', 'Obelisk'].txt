The
Nexus
Obelisk
in
Summoner's
Rift
The
Nexus
Obelisk
is
a
special
type
of
turret
.
It
is
located
at
each
team's
Spawn
Pool
and
is
untargetable.
On
Summoner's
Rift
,
Proving
Grounds
,
Twisted
Treeline
,
and
Howling
Abyss
,
the
Nexus
Obelisk
is
near
the
Shop
on
each
team.
It
deals
1000
true
damage
per
shot
with
an
attack
speed
of
2.0.
Its
damage
is
not
blocked
by
any
type
of
defensive
abilities
or
stats
such
as
armor
,
magic
resistance
.
On
the
Crystal
Scar
,
there
are
3
Nexus
Obelisks
on
each
team:
2
located
on
the
base
entrance,
and
one
near
the
shop.
These
Nexus
Obelisks
can
be
blocked
by
abilities
that
the
Obelisks
on
the
three
other
maps
go
through.

Champions
that
have
any

and

and
will
be
damaged
as
normal,
except
in
Dominion
and
Howling
Abyss.
A
champion
that
is
revived
by
Yorick's
Omen
of
Death
will
have
another
death
if
they
are
targeted
by
the
Obelisk
too.

Using
these
abilities
and/or
item
at
the
right
time
within
the
Obelisk's
range
will
prevent
damage
for
that
given
time.
Strategy
The
obelisk
can
be
used
as
a
weapon
when
defending
the
Nexus
if
the
enemies
are
close
or
near
range
of
the
Obelisk.
Champions
with
crowd
control
abilities
that
are
able
to
change
the
position
of
an
enemy
can
be
used
to
force
them
into
range
of
the
Obelisk,
quickly
melting
down
their
health
or
even
killing
them.
Baiting
enemies
into
the
Obelisk's
range
(melee
is
easier)
can
also
bring
the
same
result.
Blitzcrank
and
Thresh
in
particular
can
grab
and
hold
an
enemy
in
range
of
the
obelisk.
The
obelisk
can
be
temporarily
disabled
by
Ohmwrecker's
active.
