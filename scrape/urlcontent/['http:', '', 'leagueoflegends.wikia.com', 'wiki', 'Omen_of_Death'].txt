revive
effect
differs

revive
effects.
The
ally
has
full
health
restored.

puts
the
ally

seconds
left

the
ally's
items,
instead
of

physical
damage
and
benefit
from
minion-enhancing
auras.

Ghoul
loses
20%
of
its
max
health
each
second.
This
limits
its
duration
to
5
seconds.
Ghouls
take
50%
less
damage
from
multi-target
abilities
and
are
immune
to
slows.
