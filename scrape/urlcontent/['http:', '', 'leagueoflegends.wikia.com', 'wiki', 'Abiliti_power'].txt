Ability
power
(AP)
is
a
champion
statistic
that
increases
the
effectiveness
of
most
abilities
.
It
stacks
additively
.
Effects
that
benefit
from
ability
power
receive
a
bonus
based
on
a
certain
percentage
of
a
champion
's
current
ability
power.
For
example,
if
a
spell
deals
100
(+20%
AP)
damage
and
a
champion
has
50
ability
power,
the
spell's
damage
will
increase
by
10.
In-game,
spell
descriptions
do
not
display
the
percentage,
but
do
display
the
resulting
bonus;
the
previous
example
would
display
as
100
(+10)
.

Trivia
The
ability
with
the
largest
AP
ratio
is
Annie's
Summon:
Tibbers
,
with
a
maximum
AP
ratio
of
9.
7
counting
initial
cast
and
the
target
taking
damage
from
all
45
ticks
of
tibbers
aura
damage.
Darius
,
Draven
,
Garen
,
Olaf
,
Riven
,
Talon
,
Vayne
,
and
Zed
have
no
abilities
or
innate
effects
that
scale
with
ability
power.
Aside
from
Veigar
and
Thresh
,
who
may
obtain
theoretically
infinite
ability
power
due
to
the
passive
effects
of
Baleful
Strike
and
Damnation
respectively,
and
Galio
,
whose
Runic
Skin
interacts
with
a
metagame
mechanic
not
intended
to
be
seen
in
gameplay
(bonus
magic
resistance
when
disconnected),
the
highest
attainable
ability
power
by
a
playable
champion
is
1782.598...
on
Mordekaiser
.
To
reach
this
amount,
he
must:
have
a
fully
stacked
Mejai's
Soulstealer
and
five
Rabadon's
Deathcaps
.
have

This

AP.
The

will
