Trivia
Katarina
was
designed
by
Coronach
.
Katarina's
bio
has
been
revised
by
RiotRaven
and
Kitae
in
order
to
give
her
character
more
depth.
[1]
[2]
[3]
Katarina
is
voiced
by
Tara
Platt
.
Katarina's
family
name,
Du
Couteau,
is
derived
from
French,
which
means
"Of
the
Knife".
A
framed
portrait
of
Katarina
can
be
seen
in
the
preview
video
for
the
Mac
Version
Launch
for
League
of
Legends.
Katarina
is
the
sister
of
Cassiopeia
,
making
them
one
of
five
pairs
of
sibling
champions.
The
other
siblings
champions
include
Kayle
and
Morgana
,
Garen
and
Lux
,
Nasus
and
Renekton
,
and
Darius
and
Draven
.
Katarina's
Shunpo
is
possibly
a
reference
to
a
fictional
technique
in
the
popular
manga
series
Bleach
.
Its
name
is
Japanese
(written
as
瞬步)
and
means
"Flash
Steps,"
indicating
that
the
person
can
move
between
two
spots
in
the
blink
of
an
eye.
Katarina
was
one
of
the
champions
chosen
for
the
Noxian
pool
available
during
the
Ionia
vs.
Noxus
match
.
However,
she
was
not
one
of
the
selected
champions
.
When
Katarina
was
first
released,
her
default
skin
was
the
one
that
is
now
labeled
as
her
Mercenary
skin.
This
also
applied
to
her
imagery
on
skill
icons,
which
can
still
be
viewed
in-game.
She
later
had
her
skin,
her
voiceovers,
and
her
backstory
reworked.
Katarina's
dance
references
from
the
last
dance
scene
in
the
movie
Napoleon
Dynamite
.
The
scene
can
be
seen
here
.
It
has
since
been
changed;
It
still
features
the
first
part
of
the
dance,
but
the
later
animation
of
the
dance
is
now
a
punching
motion
with
her
knives
that
rapidly
gains
speed.
Katarina
is
one
of
the
few
champions
to
feature
two
champion
spotlights
due
to
significant
changes
to
her
kit.
Quotes
Katarina's
old
voiceovers
were
similar
to
the
new
ones
but
were
angrier.
Her
old
voiceovers
can
be
heard
here
.
Katarina's
old
taunt
used
to
be,
"Remember,
evil
spelled
backwards
is
live.
No
coincidence."
Katarina's
old
joke
is
a
reference
to
her
old
voice
actor,
who
mispronounced
the
term
"Dance
Macabre".
The
joke
refers
to
the
Danse
Macabre
,
or
"The
Dance
of
Death,"
a
medieval
allegory
on
the
"Universality
of
Death."
Katarina
is
one
of
the
few
champions
that
had
their
in-game
voices
changed;
others
include
Anivia
,
Janna
and
Nasus
.
Katarina's
quote
"Why?
Because
I
can.
"
is
a
tribute
to
Shawn
Michaels,
famous
WWE
wrestler.
Skins
Bilgewater
Katarina
skin
was
inspired
by
ChiZ's
Swashbuckler
Katarina
skin.
The
animator
also
inspired
Riot
with
his
White
Knight
skin
for
Poppy
.
The
Red
Card
Katarina
skin,
along
with
the
soccer
skins
for
other
champions,
appeared
just
before
the
2010
World
Cup
started,
and
were
removed
from
the
store
on
October
31,
2010.
Sandstorm
Katarina
has
a
new
taunt
animation
in
which
she
does
a
backflip
instead
of
the
usual
animation.
During
the
Maokai
Art
Spotlight,
a
photoshop
tab
called
:File:Katarina
OriginalSkin.jpg|katarina-painting1.jpg
was
visible.
The
image
on
the
tab
turned
out
to
be
a
new
splash
art
for
Katarina's
Classic
skin.
Katarina's
Chinese
artwork
shows
her
having
a
tattoo
on
her
right
hip.
This
tattoo
is
also
visable
in
the
Season
One
trailer,
but
not
on
the
normal
splash
art.
Katarina
in-game
model
now
has
a
tattoo
on
her
left
side
after
the
rework.
Katarina
currently
has
an
unreleased
skin
under
the
name
"
Crimson
Elite
Katarina
".
Slay
Belle
Katarina's
previous
Recall
Animation
have
her
doing
pole
dancing
with
a
candy
cane
(can
be
seen
here
)
and
was
later
changed
to
slicing
a
candy
cane
instead
because
Riot
stated
that
the
previous
animation
does
not
match
with
Katarina's
theme.
A
man
in
Slay
Belle
Katarina's
splash
art
is
similar
to
Garen
in
clothing
and
hair.
It
might
be
done
on
purpose
.
Relations
Katarina
and
Cassiopeia
are
sisters.
Katarina
regards
Talon
as
a
colleague
and,
in
some
ways,
a
little
brother.
However,
she
also
treats
him
like
an
emotional
punching
bag
from
time
to
time.
Katarina
and
Garen
first
fought
during
a
war
between
Demacia
and
Noxus
.
Katarina
and
Garen
were
the
ones
who
stopped
the
inter-city
brawl
in
Kalamanda
.
According
to
Blitzcrank's
"Fleshling
Compatibility
Service,"
a
dating
service
made
by
Blitzcrank,
Katarina
and
Garen
make
a
perfect
couple,
but
are
not
officially
together.
Fans
have
since
been
joking
about
their
relationship.
Katarina
once
came
to
Demacia
to
protest
about
High
Councilor
Heywan
Relivash's
conspiracy
in
Kalamanda
along
with
Jarvan
IV
.
She
was
attacked
but
Garen
defended
her.
With
her
unreleased
skin,
she
is
revealed
to
be
part
of
the
Crimson
Elite,
along
with
Riven
and
Talon
.
