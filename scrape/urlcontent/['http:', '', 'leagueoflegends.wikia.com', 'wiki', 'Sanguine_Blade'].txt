The
Bloodthirster
Notes
Sanguine
Blade
was
released
for
the
Dominion
game
mode
where
it
replaces
The
Bloodthirster
.
It
is
also
available
in
the
Howling
Abyss
and
Twisted
Treeline
.
Multiple
Sanguine
Blades
do
not
grant
extra
stacks
for
every
auto
attack,
nor
do
they
increase
the
maximum
cap
of
stacks
obtainable.
Strategy
Because
Sanguine
Blade
requires
the
holder
to
remain
in
combat
to
maintain
stacks,
it
is
often
beneficial
to
attack
minions
while
waiting
for
an
opening
to
ensure
that
the
weapon
will
be
fully
stacked
when
a
team
fight
breaks
out.
