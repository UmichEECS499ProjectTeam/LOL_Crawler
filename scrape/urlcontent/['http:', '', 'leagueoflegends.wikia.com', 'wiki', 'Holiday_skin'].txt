Snowdown
Champion
Skins
,
like
Harrowing
skins,
have
been
released
for
a
various
League
favorites
since
2009.
The
first
groups
of
these
festive
skins
began
as
limited
edition
only
-
meaning
once
they
left
the
store
they
were
not
coming
back
in
the
future.
More
recently
Snowdown
skins
have
been
made
Legacy,
meaning
after
they
leave
the
store
at
the
end
of
the
event
there
is
a
chance
they
might
come
back
in
the
future
for
a
limited
time.
Limited
Skins
to
Legacy
Due
to
League
of
Legends's
dramatic
increase
in
its
community,
the
Snowdown
Showdown
skins
that
were
originally
released
as
limited
edition
were
changed
to
Legacy
skins
in
December
2013,
and
put
back
on
sale
during
the
year's
holiday
event.
Riot
stated
that
the
...
overwhelming
player
feedback
has
been
that
this
creates
an
extremely
negative
experience
for
players
who
cannot
acquire
their
favorite
skin
for
their
favorite
champion.
We
believe
that
skins
should
be
more
about
self-expression
and
fun
than
exclusivity,
so
we
are
rereleasing
them
in
a
limited
way

Veteran
Player
Compensation
As
the
value
of
exclusivity
will
lower
in
the
process
of
bringing
back
the
limited
edition
skins,
Riot
is
giving
compensation
to
the
veteran
players
that
originally
bought
the
holiday
skins
in
2009
and
2010.
They
are
gifting
RP
equal
to
the
cost
of
the
skins
they
purchased,
giving
Vintage
treatment
to
the
loading
screen
of
those
Snowdown
skins
as
well
as
an
giving
those
players
an
exclusive
summoner
icon.
