Trivia
Cassiopeia
was
designed
by
Brackhar
[1]
.
Brackhar's
goal
was
to
create
a
character
in
the
same
flavor
as
Anivia
,
but
to
make
a
fast
sustained
damage
character
as
opposed
to
a
slow,
bursty
one.
Cassiopeia
is
voiced
by
Karen
Strassman
,
Who
also
voices
Fiora
,
Shyvana
,
Zyra
,
and
Elise
.
Cassiopeia
was
the
last
champion
released
in
2010.
Cassiopeia
is
the
third
champion
to
have
an
Art
Spotlight.
She
features
a
unique
Spotlight,
showing
the
animation
process
of
her
taunt.
Cassiopeia
generally
has
an
"Ancient
Greece"
theme,
as
indicated
with
her
name
and
appearance
in
three
of
her
skins
(Classic,
Siren
and
Mythic).
Cassiopeia
is
the
third
champion,
after
Gentleman
Cho'Gath
and
Corporate
Mundo
,
to
take
part
in
an
interview.
Cassiopeia
and
Katarina
are
one
of
the
five
pairs
of
sibling
champions.
(The
other
siblings
champions
include
Kayle
and
Morgana
,
Garen
and
Lux
,
Nasus
and
Renekton
,
Darius
and
Draven
)
Katarina's
quote
about
Cassiopeia
is
a
direct
reference
to
Lady
Macbeth's
description
of
how
Macbeth
should
be:
"...look
like
the
innocent
flower,
but
be
the
serpent
under't"
(I.v.65-66).
Cassiopeia
is
a
constellation
in
the
northern
sky,
listed
by
the
2nd
century
Greek
astronomer
Ptolemy
.
The
symbolic
meaning
of
the
constellation
Cassiopeia
is
"Seated
Queen",
further
referenced
by
her
classic
skin.
Her
ability
Miasma
may
refer
to
Greek
mythology,
where
miasma
is
a
contagious
power
that
has
an
independent
life
of
its
own.
Until
purged
by
the
sacrificial
death
of
the
wrongdoer,
society
would
be
chronically
infected
by
catastrophe.
Cassiopeia
was
the
first
champion
to
have
a
difficulty
rating
of
100,
and
is
currently
one
of
four
champions
to
do
so,
the
others
being
Orianna
,
Syndra
,
and
Draven
.
Cassiopeia
is
heavily
based
on
Medusa
,
a
Gorgon
from
Greek
mythology.
They
both
were
beauties
before
they
got
turned
into
monsters.
They
both
have
relations
with
snakes.
Cassiopeia
being
half-snake
half-human
and
Medusa
having
snake
hair.
Cassiopeia's
ultimate,
Petrifying
Gaze
,
turns
enemy
champions
into
stone,
similar
to
how
Medusa's
glance
turned
her
enemies
into
stone.
Cassiopeia
bears
resemblance
to
a
combination
of
a
naga,
dracaenae,
or
snake
woman,
and
Medusa.
Cassiopeia
may
be
a
reference
to
Queen
Cassiopeia
from
Greek
mythology
who
boasted
of
her
great
beauty.
Poseidon
punished
her
by
demanding
her
daughter
Andromeda
be
sacrificed
to
the
Kraken.
Perseus,
having
just
slain
the
Gorgon
Medusa,
slew
the
sea
monster
and
saved
the
princess.
Cassiopeia
might
also
be
a
reference
to
Cleopatra
VII
,
the
last
pharaoh
of
Ancient
Egypt.
Cleopatra
VII
was
a
temptress
who
seduced
various
powerful
men
like
Julius
Caesar.
She
killed
herself
using
a
bite
from
an
asp.
There's
an
interesting
link
between
Cassiopeia
and
summer
version
of
Summoner's
Rift
-
whenever
Cassiopeia
is
present
on
it,
the
snakes
(normally
randomly
appearing
doodad-creatures
in
the
bushes)
don't
appear
on
the
map.
It
also
means
that
Cassiopeia
is
the
first
champion
to
actually
affect
the
appearance
of
a
map
during
the
whole
match.
Cassiopeia's
dance
is
the
"Weeping
Willow"
dance,
a
style
of
liquid
dancing.
Cassiopeia
is
the
first
Champion
to
utilize
the
effects
of
other
champions'
abilities.
Teemo's
Toxic
Shot
and
Noxious
Trap
,
and
Singed's
Poison
Trail
can
be
used
to
shorten
Twin
Fang
cooldown.
Yasuo
is
the
second
champion,
who
is
able
to
use
Last
Breath
on
enemies
knocked
up
by
other
champion's
abilities,
such
as
Janna's
Howling
Gale
or
Vi's
Assault
and
Battery
.
If
Cassiopeia's
portrait
would
appear,
as
by
an
assist
or
kill,
and
she
is
dead,
her
old
portrait
will
appear.
If
you
search
the
item
shop
for
'hat'
while
playing
Cassiopeia,
you
will
find
Boots
of
Speed
[2]
.
Quotes
Cassiopeia's
line,
"You
found
me
beautiful,
once."
may
be
a
reference
to
the
movie
Army
of
Darkness
,
where
the
female
lead
proclaims
the
same
to
Ash,
the
male
lead,
after
she
is
corrupted
by
the
evil
Deadites.
Cassiopeia's
picking
speech
refer
to
same
words
of
Lady
Deathstrike
in
"X-Men
The
Animated
Series",
when
Wolverine
asks
what
has
she
done
to
herself
and
she
reply
same
as
Cassiopeia.
Cassiopeia's
taunt,
"Let
me
help
shuffle
off
your
mortal
coil."
is
a
reference
to
Hamlet
,
from
the
titular
character's
famous
"To
be,
or
not
to
be"
monologue.
Cassiopeia's
alternate
taunt
"You
think
I'm
a
freak;
let
me
get
on
your
level"
is
a
tribute
to
rioter
Phreak's
line
"Get
on
my
level."
.
Skins
Siren
Cassiopeia
is
a
reference
to
the
mythological
creatures
of
Ancient
Greece
called
Sirens
,
seductresses
that
enchanted
men
into
the
sea
to
drown.
In
Perseus
Pantheon's
skin,
Cassiopeia's
head
is
depicted
on
his
shield,
most
likely
referencing
their
shared
Greek
relations.
From
the
pose,
Pantheon
is
reflecting
Cassiopeia's
Petrifying
Gaze
,
mirroring
the
Perseus
vs
Medusa
fight
of
Greek
mythology.
Mythic
Cassiopeia
is
a
commemorative
skin
created
to
celebrate
the
launch
of
League
of
Legend's
Greek
servers.
The
skin,
along
with
Cassiopeia
is
given
for
free
to
all
players
on
the
Greek
server.
Jade
Fang
Cassiopeia
is
released
as
part
of
the
Lunar
revel
event
in
2013,
coincidentally
matching
the
year
of
snake
in
Chinese
zodiac
.
Relations
Cassiopeia
is
Katarina's
younger
sister,
as
well
as
the
youngest
member
of
the
Du
Couteau
family.
