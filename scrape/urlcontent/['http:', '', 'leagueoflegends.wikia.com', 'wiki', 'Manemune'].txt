Similar
Items
Archangel's
Staff
Notes
Manamune
gives
1
attack
damage
per
50
mana
.
With
its
flat
20
bonus
attack
damage,
it
provides
as
much
attack
damage
as
a
B.
F.
Sword
at
1250
mana.
Taking
into
account
how
much
Manamune
costs,
it
is
less
efficient
than
a
B.
F.
Sword
until
1878
mana,
although
it
does
help
with
early
game
mana
issues.
Multiple
Manamunes
will
not
stack
any
of
its
effects,
as
they
are
unique.
While
Archangel's
Staff
is
effective
with
Manamune
for
stats
,
its
mana
bonus
does
not
stack
with
Manamune's
,
nor
does
that
of
Tear
of
the
Goddess
.
It
is
only
possible
to
begin
stacking
a
new
Tear
of
the
Goddess
,
Archangel's
Staff
or
Manamune
if
one
of
the
latter
two
upgrades
into
Seraph's
Embrace
or
Muramana
,
respectively.
Assuming
a
Mana
Charge
stack
is
gained
once
every
4
seconds,
the
750-mana
unique
passive
takes
12
minutes
and
32
seconds
to
max.
Manamune
may
be
used
to
charge
Archangel's
Staff
using
only
basic
attacks,
as
Archangel's
Staff's
transformation
takes
priority.
Manaless
champions
may
charge
the
Tear
of
the
Goddess
,
Manamune
and
Archangel's
Staff
to
get
Muramana
and
Seraph's
Embrace
.
However,
they
won't
get
any
bonuses
of
Muramana's
Awe
and
toggle,
as
well
as
Seraph's
Embrace's
Insight
and
Mana
Shield
.
Trivia
The
name
"Manamune"
is
a
reference
to
the
legendary
swordsmith
Masamune
,
who
is
widely
regarded
as
Japan's
greatest
swordsmith.
The
Manamune
was
created
accidentally
by
Alowicious
Chucat
while
he
was
working
with
a
blueprint
for
a
different
item.
The
icon/picture
of
Manamune
has
a
high
resemblance
to
the
sword
Soul
calibur,
from
the
Soul
calibur
1
and
2.
