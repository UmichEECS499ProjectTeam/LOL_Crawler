The
Lizard
Elder
is
a
neutral
monster
in
League
of
Legends
described
in-game
as,
"a
melee
monster
with
large
amounts
of
health.
Killing
this
foe
grants
a
slowing
attack
that
deals
damage
over
time."
It
only
appears
on
Summoner's
Rift
,
where
it
spawns
with
two
Young
Lizards
.
When
killed,
the
Lizard
Elder
grants
its
killer
the
Blessing
of
the
Lizard
Elder
buff
(very
often
just
referred
to
as
Red
buff),
where
every
hit
deals
10-44
(8
+
[2
x
level])
bonus
true
damage
twice
and
slows
enemies
(8/16/24%
for
melee
or
5/10/15%
for
ranged
attacks)
for
3
seconds.
Strategy
Controlling
the
Lizard
buffs
can
give
your
team
an
advantage
in
the
match.
Most
junglers
will
attempt
to
control
not
only
their
own
but
also
the
opposing
team's
buff.
The
lizard
spawn
is
indicated
by
a
gold
marker
on
the
minimap.
If
your
team
has
vision
when
or
after
the
lizard
is
killed,
the
gold
marker
will
disappear
and
reappear
when
the
camp
respawns.
The
lizard
will
respawn
regardless
of
whether
its
buff
is
still
on
the
map,
so
there
can
potentially
be
more
than
two
of
the
buffs
active
if
their
durations
have
been
reset
for
long
enough.
The
same
applies
for
the
Ancient
Golem
.
The
lizard
does
not
respawn
if
the
young
lizards
are
not
killed.
This
can
be
used
against
the
enemy
when
taking
buffs
from
the
enemy
jungle,
as
it
robs
them
of
potential
buffs
until
they
kill
the
remaining
creeps
and
it
respawns.
