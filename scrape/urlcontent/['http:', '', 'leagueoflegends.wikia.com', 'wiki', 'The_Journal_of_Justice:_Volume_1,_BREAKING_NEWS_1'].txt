Kalamanda
Pacified
The
League
takes
necessary
and
decisive
action
in
the
interest
of
peace
Quinton
Groat
reporting
from
Kalamanda
League
intervention
in
Kalamanda
leaves
warring
soldiers
suspended
in
time.
In
an
unprecedented
show
of
force,
the
League
of
Legends
conjured
a
temporal
stasis
bubble
over
the
entirety
of
Kalamanda
,
trapping
the
warring
forces
of
Noxus
and
Demacia
in
a
mid-battle
state
of
suspension.
The
soldiers
inside
will
be
extracted
and
returned
to
their
homes,
but
the
League
has
pronounced
the
village
and
its
immediate
surroundings
uninhabitable.
Last
night,
the
League
sent
four
hundred
summoners
to
the
far
edges
of
the
Kalamanda
conflict,
transporting
with
them
a
small
nexus
that
was,
according
to
scholars
of
the
Arcanum
Majoris,
a
centerpiece
of
the
Arcanum
Vault.
Utilizing
ancient
Urtistani
techniques
refined
by
League
champion
Zilean
,
these
summoners
undertook
an
enchantment
the
magnitude
of
which
hasn’t
been
seen
in
Valoran
since
the
Rune
Wars.
“Our
appeals
for
an
immediate
cessation
of
hostilities
went
unheeded
by
the
rulers
of
Noxus
and
Demacia,”
stated
Kiersta
Mandrake,
High
Councilor,
in
a
public
address
the
following
morning.
“Never
before
has
the
resolve
of
the
League
of
Legends
been
so
brazenly
and
frivolously
tested.
We
are
not
a
governing
body,
we
are
not
enforcers,
we
are
the
collective
will
of
the
citizens
of
Valoran,
and
we
demand
a
new
future.
Runeterra
will
not,
cannot,
support
the
wanton
use
of
magic
any
longer,
and
we,
as
a
people,
refuse
to
accept
lives
set
against
a
backdrop
of
war.”
Though
aware
of
the
gravity
of
such
measures,
League
officials
decided
that
definitive
action
was
necessary.
A
great
deal
of
care
was
devoted
to
ensuring
that
Runeterra
sustained
the
least
possible
destruction
as
a
result
of
the
spell.
“Calling
this
spell
dangerous
is
like
calling
the
Guardian’s
Sea
wet,”
said
Heywan
Relivash,
High
Councilor
of
the
League
and
overseer
of
the
operation.
“A
considerable
amount
of
the
ecological
danger
was
instead
transferred
upon
our
summoners,
as
the
complete
energy
of
the
nexus
was
drawn
and
channeled
through
their
bodies.
One
summoner’s
misstep
would
have
likely
cost
all
their
lives.
Fortunately,
no
misstep
was
made.
The
nexus
itself
was
expended
in
the
process
–
a
treasured
artifact
sacrificed
to
minimize
the
environmental
risk.
That
such
a
resource
was
expended
to
prevent
what
may
have
become
a
ruinous
war
is
at
once
a
tragic
waste
and
the
most
noble
possible
cause.”
Though
experts
believe
the
damage
to
Runeterra
is
minimal,
they
have
determined
that
the
area
occupied
by
the
bubble
will
be
magically
unstable
for
decades.
Soldier
extraction
has
already
begun,
and
will
continue
through
the
coming
weeks.
It
will
be
a
slow
and
intensive
process,
as
Zilean
believes
improper
extraction
may
lead
to
chrono-displasia,
a
disease
he
himself
endures.
League
surveyors
have
been
dispatched
to
the
village
to
assess
the
true
extent
of
the
damage,
as
well
as
to
determine
if
there
would
be
any
way
to
speed
its
restoration.
The
League
made
arrangements
for
the
families
of
Kalamanda
residents,
accepting
responsibility
for
restricting
them
from
their
own
homes.
For
now,
the
war
seems
to
have
stopped.
Ambassadors
from
Noxus
and
Demacia
have
taken
residence
in
the
Institute
of
War
as
they
negotiate
the
safe
return
of
their
soldiers,
as
well
as
terms
for
a
peaceful
resolution
to
this
conflict.
