Decoys
The
following
pets
are
classified
as
"decoys",
and
are
considered
champions
in
almost
all
respects
(such
as
tower
priority,
valid
targets,
etc),
except
that
their
damage
is
still
credited
to
their
owner
(and
so
will
attract
tower
aggro
as
with
any
champion
damage).
It
is
worth
noting
that
the
damage
dealt
by
a
clone's
auto
attacks
will
not
trigger
on-ability
effects
such
as
spell
vamp
or
Rylai's

to
heal
themselves
with
life
steal
if
they
have
any.

will
proc
with
decoys.

Note
that
this

mean
whether

not
the
minion
scales
with
attack
damage
or
ability
power,
but
the
minion's
personal
statistics.
Other
damage
dealt
by

pet,
such
as

aura,
will
apply
on-ability
effects.

regen,
they
will
not
receive
increased
damage
on
their
attacks.

This
could
be
a
bug,

such

is
accompanied
by
the
faerie,
Pix
Pix
augments
Lulu's
attacks,
or
the
target
of

Assault
.

to
reveal
the
area
during
Heightened
Senses
.
Valor
replaces
Quinn
during
Tag
Team
.
Unlike
all
other
companions
Valor
is
not
visibly
next
to
Quinn
most
of
the
time,
he
is
instead
flying
high
in
the
air
(not
visibly),
and
from
there
he
looks
for
vulnerable
targets
.
However,
he
comes
to
Quinn's
shoulder
during
her
recall
and
joke
animations.
Swain
is
accompanied
by
the
raven,
Beatrice
Beatrice
replenishes
Swain's
mana
whenever
he
kills
a
unit.
Beatrice
blasts
the
selected
enemy
when
Swain
casts
Decrepify
,
and
becomes
a
static
unit.
Beatrice
flies
away
if
Swain
dies.
Beatrice
can
occasionally
be
seen
in
the
Crystal
Scar
at
the
Graveyard,
but
she
does
not
appear
if
Swain
is
present
on
the
battlefield.
Orianna's
ball
The
ball
is
an
extension
of
Orianna's
abilities,
and
can
only
be
controlled
by
her
abilities
(or
by
jumping
to
her
if
she
moves
too
far
from
it).
The
ball
breaks
down
when
Orianna
dies.
Syndra's
Dark
Sphere
She
may
place
up
to
4
of
these
at

time.

other
abilities
can
affect
the
Spheres.
Spheres

on
the
battlefield
for
their
remaining
duration
after

dies
but
are
completely
useless,
as
only
Syndra
can
manipulate
them.
Viktor's
Chaos
Storm
Chaos
Storm
can
be
controlled
by
pressing
[R].
The
distinction
is
being
made
between
Chaos
Storm
and
Tibbers
because

Storm
is
not
considered
a
minion
for
the
purposes
of
Banner
of
Command
.

all
enemies
around
it.

away
it

dies,
Chaos
Storm
will
not
cancel

sooner
than
usual,
will
remain
stationary,
and
will
continue
to
deal
damage
for
the
rest
of
its
duration.
Zed
can
summon
up
to
2
shadows,
one
from
Living
Shadow
and
a
second
from
Death
Mark
.
Zed's
shadows
mimics
his
abilities.
While
sharing
Zed's
appearance,
they
are
not
classified
as
clones
and
are
untargetable
.
For
example,
Sejuani's
Arctic
Assault
will
stop
upon
hitting
a
clone;
whereas
she
will
not
collide
with
his
shadows.
Shadows
stay
for
their
remaining
duration
even
after
Zed
dies,
but
are
completely
useless
as
only
Zed
can
manipulate
them.
Janna's
Zephyr
grants
her
a
companion,
an
air
elemental
in
the
form
of
a
bird.
Janna

ability
comes
off
cooldown.
