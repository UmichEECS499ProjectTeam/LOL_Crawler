A
champion
that
is
manaless
does
not
use
nor
benefit
from
mana
or
mana
regeneration
.
To
date,
there
are
19
champions
that
do
not
use
mana
.
Of
the
champions
the
do
not
use
mana,
some
utilize
an
alternative
resource
to
cast
their
abilities.
These
champions
use
health
as
their
casting
resource.
Aatrox
Dr.
Mundo
Mordekaiser
Vladimir
Zac
These
champions
use
energy
as
their
casting
resource.
Akali
Kennen
Lee
Sin
Shen
Zed
The
remaining
manaless
champions
have
no
costs
related
to
their
abilities.
Garen
Katarina
Renekton
Rengar
Riven
Rumble
Shyvana
Tryndamere
Yasuo
Alternative
Gating
Mechanics
In
place
of
or
acting
as
a
resource,
there
are
a
number
of
alternative
mechanics
that
gate
the
availability
of
a
champion's
abilities.
Health
Main
article:
Health
Champions
who
use
their
own
health
as
their
resource:
Aatrox
,
Dr.
Mundo
,
Mordekaiser
,
Vladimir
and
Zac
.
These
champions
use
their
own
health
to
cast
some
—
or
all
—
of
their
abilities.
Champions
can
never
kill
themselves
due
to
ability
casting,
as
their
abilities
become
free
at
critical
levels
of
health.
While
these
champions
can
cast
their
abilities
more
freely
than
most,
their
disadvantage
is
that
frequent
ability
usage
will
bring
them
closer
to
death.
With
the
exception
of
Dr.
Mundo's
Sadism
the
ultimate
abilities
of
health-using
champions
are
free
of
any
cost;
only
gated
by
cooldown.
It's
worth
noting
that
all
of
these
champions
have
at
least
one
ability
capable
of
restoring
their
health.
Energy
Main
article:
Energy
Champions
who
use
energy
as
their
resource:
Akali
,
Kennen
,
Lee
Sin
,
Shen
and
Zed
Energy
champions
use
an
alternative
to
mana
for
spending
on
abilities.
Having
a
maximum
of
200
energy
with
no
growth
per
level,
the
main
advantage
of
energy
is
its
rapid
regeneration
(10
energy
per
second),
so
that
energy
champions
are
not
at
the
risk
of
depleting
their
resource
over
an
extended
period
of
time.
The
main
disadvantage
of
energy
is
that
its
small
capacity
restricts
the
rapid
usage
of
multiple
spells
in
a
short
period
of
time.
The
energy
resource
bar
is
colored
yellow
.
Ferocity
Unique
to
Rengar
,
Ferocity
is
generated
whenever
Rengar
lands
an
ability
or
passively
during
Thrill
of
the
Hunt
.
Rengar
can
have
up
to
5
Ferocity,
and
having
maximum
Ferocity
allows
Rengar
to
use
one
of
his
empowered
abilities.
Rengar's
resource
bar
is
divided
into
5
sections
that
appear
as
he
gains
5
Ferocity.
While
Rengar
has
between
1
and
4
Ferocity,
the
sections
are
colored
white
.
Upon
reaching
5
Ferocity,
the
sections
are
colored
orange
.
Fury
For
the
mastery,
see
Fury
(Season
Four
Mastery)
.
Fury
behaves
uniquely
on
each
champion
that
utilizes
it.
The
only
consistent
features
are
that
each
champion
can
generate
fury
on-hit
or
with
their
ultimates,
and
the
resource
bar
is
colored
red
.
Renekton
Renekton's
Fury
is
generated
whenever
he
attacks
an
enemy,
per
enemy
hit
by
Cull
the
Meek
and
passively
during
Dominus
.
If
Renekton
has
50
or
more
Fury,
his
next
ability
will
be
empowered
at
the
cost
of
50
Fury.
Renekton's
Fury
will
begin
to
deplete
if
he
has
not
been
in
combat
for
12
seconds.
Due
to
Reign
of
Anger
Renekton's
fury
generation
is
boosted
by
50%
when
he
is
under
half
health.
Shyvana
Shyvana
does
not
have
access
to
Fury
until
she
has
ranked
Dragon's
Descent
,
and
she
gains
a
full
fury
bar
(100)
once
she
does
for
the
first
time.
Shyvana's
Fury
does
not
decay
and
generates
passively
and
whenever
she
attacks
an
enemy.
100
Fury
is
required
to
activate
Dragon's
Descent
,
but
activation
does
not
instantly
consume
all
her
Fury
-
instead,
it
depletes
slowly
until
it
runs
out.
Shyvana
can
still
generate
Fury
with
her
basic
attacks
while
it
is
depleting.
Tryndamere
Tryndamere's
Fury
is
not
required
to
activate
any
of
his
abilities,
but
Battle
Fury
grants
him
bonus
critical
strike
chance
based
on
his
current
Fury
and
activating
Bloodlust
will
consume
his
current
fury
to
empower
it
healing
effect.
Tryndamere
generates
Fury
whenever
he
damages
an
enemy
with
his
basic
attacks
or
abilities,
whenever
he
kills
a
unit
and
when
he
activates
his
ultimate,
Undying
Rage
.
Tryndamere's
Fury
will
begin
to
deplete
if
he
has
not
been
in
combat
for
8
seconds.
Heat
Unique
to
Rumble
,
Heat
is
generated
whenever
he
casts
one
his
basic
abilities.
Heat
rapidly
depletes
if
Rumble
has
not
cast
an
ability
in
the
last
4
seconds.
Rumble
gains
different
effects
depending
on
his
current
Heat.
Heat
is
displayed
in
Rumble's
secondary
resource
bar,
and
is
colored
differently
depending
on
the
current
amount.
0
–
49
heat
—
No
effect.
50
–
99
heat
—
Danger
Zone
.
Rumble's
abilities
gain
additional
effects.
100
heat
—
Overheat
.
Rumble
is
silenced
and
his
basic
attacks
deal
additional
damage
until
his
heat
reaches
0.
Visually
Rumble
's
mech
is
colored
bright
red
and
you
can
hear
his
cries
of
discomfort
due
to
the
heat.
Other
uses
of
the
Secondary
Bar
Some
champions
use
the
secondary
bar
to
display
some
ability
effects
to
track
them
better.
Blood
Well
Unique
to
Aatrox
,
Blood
Well
acts
as
a
health
reserve
should
Aatrox
take
lethal
damage
-
reviving
him
with
an
amount
of
health
equal
to
the
Blood
Well's
contents
plus
a
base
amount.
The
revival
effect
has
a
cooldown,
and
the
current
amount
in
the
reserve
is
colored
red
or
white
depending
on
whether
or
not
the
effect
is
available.
Aatrox
fills
the
Blood
Well
by
casting
his
abilities,
with
100%
of
the
health
cost
being
stored
in
the
Blood
Well.
The
Blood
Well
slowly
depletes
if
Aatrox
has
not
taken
or
dealt
damage
recently.
Aatrox
also
gains
bonus
attack
speed
based
on
the
contents
of
his
current
Blood
Well,
regardless
of
whether
the
revival
effect
is
available.
Iron
Man
Unique
to
Mordekaiser
,
Iron
Man
acts
as
a
temporary,
decaying,
absorption
shield
that
is
generated
by
the
damage
he
deals
with
his
abilities.
The
resource
bar
is
colored
white.
Flow
Unique
to
Yasuo
,
Flow
is
generated
by
movement,
dashing,
teleporting
and
the
passive
effect
of
Wind
Wall
,
requiring
a
total
of
4000
traveled
units
to
be
fully
filled.
Maximum
Flow
is
required
to
use
Resolve
.
Flow
is
represented
in
Yasuo's
resource
bar
and
is
colored
grey
while
charging,
and
white
once
full
to
indicate
it's
a
shield
(as
with
Mordekaiser's
Iron
Man
).
Resolve
:
Should
Yasuo
take
damage
from
a
champion
or
jungle
monster
his
Flow
will
will
turn
into
a
shield
for
2
seconds,
after
which-
if
it
has
not
been
broken-
it
fully
depletes.
Trivia
Mordekaiser's
Iron
Man
,
Yasuo's
Flow
and
Aatrox's
Blood
Well
and
are
the
only
non-resource
or
alternative
gating
mechanics
that
is
displayed
in
the
resource
bar.
It
is
currently
being
considered
to
have
Riven's
Runic
Blade
charges
displayed
in
the
resource
bar,
in
a
visually
similar
manner
to
Rengar's
Ferocity.
[1]
If
this
change
passes,
similar
changes
may
also
be
applied
to
similar
mechanics
(such
as
Tides
of
Blood
).
When
the
mechanic
was
unique
to
Renekton,
Fury
was
known
as
"Rage".
When
Riven
was
first
released,
she
was
not
technically
classified
as
manaless
-
she
simply
had
0
(+0)
base
mana
and
0
(+0)
base
mana
regeneration.
She
could
purchase
mana
and
it
would
be
represented
in
her
resource
bar
-
allowing
her
to
use
and
benefit
from
items
such
as
Manamune
and
Archangel's
Staff
.
This
was
hotfixed
shortly
after.

Idk,
that
seems
viable.
Tell

about
it!

AXE
MURDERER
You're
right.
A
player
not
being
able
to
immediately
guauge
how
much
shield
he
has
is
fairly
crippling
for
them.
Still,
I
enjoy
being
Morde...
