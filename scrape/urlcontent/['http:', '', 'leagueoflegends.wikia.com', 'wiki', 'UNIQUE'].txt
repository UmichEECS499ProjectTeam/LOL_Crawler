Unique
is
a
term
used
to
describe
an
item
effect.
Stacking
items—using
more
than
one
of
the
same
item—
will
not
result
in
multiple
applications
of
the
item
effects
that
are
labelled
as
unique.
Unique
passive
effects
only
apply
once
from
identical
items.
Unique
active
effects
of
identical
items
do
not
stack
and
share
the
same
cooldown.
Unique
aura
effects
apply
once
to
yourself
and
once
to
allies,
so
two
champions
with
the
same
unique
aura
item
will
each
benefit
twice
from
the
aura,
but
other
champions
without
the
item
will
only
be
affected
once.
For
example,
Youmuu's
Ghostblade
has
three
parts:
+30
attack
damage
and
+15%
critical
strike
chance
Unique
Passive:
+20
armor
penetration
and
+10%
cooldown
reduction
Unique
Active:
Gives
+50%
attack
speed
and
+20%
movement
speed
for
4
seconds.
Attacking
enemies
with
melee
attacks
increases
the
duration
by
2
seconds
to
a
maximum
of
8
seconds.
60
second
cooldown.
But
since
the
last
two
effects
are
unique,
two
Youmuu's
Ghostblades
will
result
in
only
the
stats
stacking.
In
other
words,
the
effects
of
two
items
would
be:
+60
attack
damage
and
+30%
critical
strike
chance
Unique
Passive:
+20
armor
penetration
and
+10%
cooldown
reduction
Unique
Active:
Gives
+50%
attack
speed
and
+20%
movement
speed
for
4
seconds.
Attacking
enemies
with
melee
attacks
increases
the
duration
by
2
seconds
to
a
maximum
of
8
seconds.
60
second
cooldown.
Notice
that
despite
having
two
Ghostblades,
you
will
only
gain
+20
armor
penetration
and
+10%
cooldown
reduction
.
Activating
one
Ghostblade
starts
the
cooldown
of
both
and
the
buff
will
last
just
as
long
as
having
one.
However,
buying
a
second
Ghostblade
while
the
first
is
on
cooldown
will
allow
you
to
activate
it
again.
Doing
so
will
reset
the
cooldown
timer
on
both
Ghostblades.
However,
you
can
benefit
twice
from
a
unique
Aura
if
your
champion
and
a
partner's
are
carrying
the
same
item,
like
a
Soul
Shroud
,
or
Aegis
of
the
Legion
.
Teammates
that
do
not
have
the
item
will
only
receive
one
aura.
For
example,
if
you
are
carrying
an
Aegis
of
the
Legion
,
and
an
ally
is
also
carrying
one,
you
will
receive
the
buff
twice,
as
long
as
you
remain
within
range
of
other
Aegis
holder.
Other
teammates
not
carrying
an
Aegis
will
only
receive
the
buff
once.
Similarly,
most
of
the
time,
unique
effects
from
different
items
do
stack.
Using
our
last
example,
carrying
Youmuu's
Ghostblade
and
The
Brutalizer
gives
10%
+
10%
cooldown
reduction
and
20
+
10
armor
penetration
,
even
though
The
Brutalizer
is
part
of
Youmuu's
Ghostblade
's
recipe.
Unique
effects
that
do
not
stack
:
Movement
speed
from
Enhanced
Movement
On-cast
passive
of
Sheen
,
Lich
Bane
and
Trinity
Force
Maximum
mana
passive
from
Tear
of
the
Goddess
,
Manamune
,
and
Archangel's
Staff
Passive
of
Madred's
Razors
and
Wriggle's
Lantern
Health
bonus
from
Prospector's
Blade
and
Prospector's
Ring
