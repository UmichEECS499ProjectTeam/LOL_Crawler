Details
Help,
Pix!
is
a
targeted
ability
that
can
be
cast
on
either
an
allied
or
an
enemy
champion
or
minion.
Applies
spell
effects
as
a
single
target
ability.

Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
will
apply
a

Magic

will
be

and
Lifeline
.
Spell
shields
will
block
the
damage
and
vision,
but
Pix
will
still
follow
the
target.
Additional
Information:
Pix
will
respect
his
maximum
leash
and
return
to
Lulu
if
her
target
moves
2000
units
away
from
her.
Pix
is
independent
from
the
absorption
shield
when
cast
on
an
ally
and
he
will
continue
to
assist
the
target's
attacks
even
if
the
shield
breaks.
Likewise,
the
absorption
shield
will
persist
for
the
full
effect
even
if
the
ally
target
leaves
Pix's
leash
range.
While
Pix
is
away
from
Lulu,
his
bolt
from
Glitterlance
will
fire
from
his
location
toward
the
cursor.
Doing
so
can
extend
the
range
of
Glitterlance
to
be
much
larger
than
it
normally
is.

Additional
Information:
