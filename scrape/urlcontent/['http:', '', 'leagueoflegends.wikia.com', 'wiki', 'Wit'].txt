Notes
It
is
an
exceptionally
helpful
item
on
physical
damage
dealers
when
fighting
against
champions
with
low
magic
resistance.
It's
also
highly
useful
on
frequent
auto-attackers
against
champions
with
high
magic
damage,
since
at
max
stacks
it
gives
as
much
magic
resist
as
items
such
as
the
Banshee's
Veil
while
not
sacrificing
a
slot
purely
for
a
defensive
item.
Bear
in
mind,
though,
that
this
will
be
less
effective
against
burst
casters
who
can
execute
their
combos
before
you
can
achieve
max
stacks
through
auto
attacks.
It's
also
a
great
item
on
tanks
that
rely
on
attackspeed
or
have
on
hit
effects,
as
it
greatly
bolsters
their
magic
resistance,
and
the
time
it
takes
to
steal
it,
doesn't
matter
as
much,
due
to
them
being
tanky
anyway.
tanks
that
work
well
with
this
include
volibear
and
Shen.
Wit's
End
is
a
strong
counter
to
Thornmail
,
as
it
not
only
provides
the
user
an
on-hit
effect
with
their
auto-attacks
that
ignores
Thornmail
's
passive,
but
it
also
provide
magic
resistance
that
reduces
the
incoming
magic
damage
from
Thornmail
's
passive.
Wit's
End
also
increases
the
user's
magic
resistance
per
auto-attack
and
reduces
the
enemy's
magic
resistance,
thus
allowing
the
user
to
deal
more
damage
with
Wit's
End's
on-hit
passive
than
what
Thornmail
can
reflect
back.
Trivia
Considering
the
item's
name,
the
42%
attack
speed
bonus
and
42
magic
damage
on
hit
probably
is
a
reference
to
The
Hitchhiker's
Guide
to
the
Galaxy
where
42
is
the
number
that
signifies
"The
Answer
to
the
Ultimate
Question
of
Life,
the
Universe,
and
Everything".
