Trivia
Jarvan
IV
was
designed
by
Ezreal
Jarvan
IV
is
voiced
by
Kyle
Hebert
,
who
also
voices
Ezreal
and
Graves
.
His
full
name
and
title
is
Prince
Jarvan
Lightshield
the
Fourth.
The
Exemplar
of
Demacia
is
his
title.
During
Maokai's
Art
Spotlight,
a
tab
for
Jarvan
IV
can
be
faintly
seen
at
the
top.
He
was
first
mentioned
in
Urgot's
background
story.
In
Jarvan
IV's
Champion
Spotlight,
his
character
portrait
resembles
The
Lich
King
from
World
of
Warcraft
.
Jarvan
IV's
two-year
expedition
to
the
south
of
the
Great
Barrier
is
still
a
mystery.
Jarvan
IV
did
not
have
a
Judgment
before
entering
the
League
due
to
an
interruption
from
Swain
.
Thus,
no
one
has
truly
"explored"
his
mind.
Quotes
Jarvan
IV's
quote
"Today
is
a
good
day
to
die"
is
ultimately
believed
to
come
from
the
one
of
the
Lakotan
war
chiefs,
either
Crazy
Horse
or
Sitting
Bull.
Jarvan
IV's
quote
"
Ours
is
but
to
do
and
die
"
is
a
reference
to
a
line
in
The
Charge
of
the
Light
Brigade
by
Alfred,
Lord
Tennyson.
Jarvan
IV's
quote
"For
my
father,
the
king"
is
also
spoken
by
Arthas
from
the
Warcraft
series
.
In
the
Polish
client,
one
of
Jarvan
IV's
quotes
is
"We
won't
forsake
the
land
we
came
from"
(org.
Nie
rzucim
ziemi,
skąd
nasz
ród
).
This
phrase
comes
form
Polish
poem
Rota
(
The
Oath
),
which
was
proposed
to
be
Poland's
national
anthem
after
World
War
I.
Skins
Victorious
Jarvan
IV
was
rewarded
to
players
with
a
gold
or
platinum
rank
in
any
ranked
game
mode
for
free
after
Season
One
ended.
Commando
Jarvan
IV
could
be
a
reference
to
Team
Thunder
Crash
from
the
Unreal
Tournament
series
of
games,
due
to
their
similar
armor
structure,
its
dark
green
coloration,
and
the
use
of
gold
accents
and
icons.
The
Chinese
art
for
Commando
Jarvan
IV
has
a
very
striking
resemblance
to
the
cover
of
Battlefield
series
games,
namely
Battlefield
Bad
Company
2
and
Battlefield
3.
Dragonslayer
Jarvan
IV
might
have
inspired
the
connection
between
him
and
Shyvana
,
as
they
both
slew
the
dragon
that
murdered
her
father.
Darkforge
Jarvan
IV
may
be
an
allusion
to
Warcraft
III
hero
Arthas,
specifically
the
scene
where
the
aforementioned
character
(in
new
armor)
returns
home
to
a
shower
of
rose
petals.
Darkforge
Jarvan
IV
resembles
the
design
of
the
Guild
Wars
classic
warrior
symbolic
armor
stance.
Darkforge
Jarvan
IV
bears
striking
resemblance
to
the
Dragoons
of
various
Final
Fantasy
games.
Warring
Kingdoms
Jarvan
IV
is
a
homage
to
Koei's
design
of
Lu
Bu
in
Dynasty
Warriors
,
a
game
based
on
Romance
of
the
Three
Kingdoms
.
Coincidentally,
Lu
Bu
in
English
as
of
Dynasty
Warriors
5
is
voiced
by
Jamieson
Price
,
who
also
voices
fellow
Demacian
Garen
.
Relations
Jarvan
IV
is
the
son
of
Jarvan
III
,
the
King
of
Demacia.
Jarvan
IV's
grandfather,
Jarvan
II,
rescued
Xin
Zhao
from
the
Fleshing,
a
gladiator
event
in
Noxus.
Garen
is
Jarvan's
childhood
companion.
Jarvan
IV
is
the
arch-enemy
of
Jericho
Swain
.
Moved
by
Shyvana's
plight,
Jarvan
IV
assisted
her
in
slaying
the
mighty
dragon
that
killed
her
father.
After
the
battle,
Jarvan
IV
offered
Shyvana
a
place
as
a
noble
warrior
in
the
ranks
of
the
Demacian
Elite
Guard.
Out
of
gratitude
and
necessity,
Shyvana
accepted.
In
Poppy's
backstory,
she
delivers
a
helm
that
she
and
her
father
had
made.
This
was
said
to
have
been
very
important,
and
also
was
described
as
having
a
jewel
in
the
front,
similar
to
Jarvan
IV's
helm
in
his
classic
skin.
It
has
been
speculated
that
LeBlanc
disguised
herself
as
Jarvan
IV,
or
had
mentally
manipulated
him,
in
order
to
start
the
Kalamandan
war
between
Demacia
and
Noxus
.
After
Jarvan
IV
was
defeated
and
nearly
executed
by
Swain
and
Urgot
,
people
described
him
as
"different".
This
lead
to
the
speculation
that
for
a
period
of
time,
LeBlanc
replaced
Jarvan
IV.
However,
according
to
speculations
made
based
on
a
note
,
Jarvan
IV
was
kidnapped
and
replaced
by
LeBlanc
months
after
his
Judgement
was
held.
By
looking
at
later
issues
of
Journal
of
Justice,
it
is
also
possible
to
say
that
Jarvan
IV
was
likely
rescued
by
Katarina
,
thus
he
is
no
longer
impersonated
by
LeBlanc.
Similarly,
the
fact
that
people
described
Jarvan
as
being
"different"
after
his
failure,
and
that
his
two
year
long
journey
is
quite
mysterious,
are
probably
unrelated
to
this
issue
since
both
events
occured
long
before
Jarvan
IV
even
became
a
champion.
RiotRunaan
stated
that
what
was
going
on
with
Jarvan
IV
is
very
different
from
what
the
community
thinks,
so
this
theory
is
most
likely
false.
Jarvan
IV
once
protested
with
Katarina
about
Heywan
Relivash's
involvement
in
the
upbringing
of
Kalamandan
War
with
Swain
.
