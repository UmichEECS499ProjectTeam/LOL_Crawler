Skill
usage
Ezreal's
strength
as
a
marksman
comes
from
his
versatile
kit,
high
mixed
damage,
and
attack
speed
steroid
from
Rising
Spell
Force
.
His
Mystic
Shot
,
Essence
Flux
,
and
Arcane
Shift
have
decent
range
and
good
utility,
encouraging
a
caster
playstyle,
and
his
Trueshot
Barrage
can
deal
high
burst
damage
to
multiple
targets.
Ezreal
has
one
of
the
lowest
base
healths
at
Level
1.
Utilize
the
range
from
your
skills
to
keep
yourself
safe.
By
aiming
Mystic
Shot
in
brushes
and
watching
your
cooldowns
while
listening
for
Mystic
Shot's
hit
sound,
you
can
see
if
enemies
are
hiding
in
a
brush
.
Keep
an
eye
on
your
Rising
Spell
Force
stacks
and
whether
they
increase/refresh.
This
aspect
allows
you
to
check
brush
with
Ezreal's
other
abilities
as
well.
Ezreal
can
utilize
the
Spell
Weaving
and
Blade
Weaving
masteries
to
stack
up
a
fair
amount
of
extra
damage
with
successive
spells
and
auto
attacks
against
enemy
champions.
However,
players
must
be
more
aggressive
and
ensure
that
they
land
their
skills.
If
attacking
a
tower
with
an
ally,
you
can
use
Essence
Flux
on
them
to
boost
their
attack
speed.
Hitting
the
friendly
champion
will
proc
Rising
Spell
Force
,
granting
you
attack
speed
as
well.
In
the
lane,
Ezreal's
early
burst
damage
and
poke
is
very
high.
Combine
this
with
a
support
or
jungler's
crowd
control
to
get
some
kills.
Do
not
underestimate
Essence
Flux's
damage
when
building
Ability
Power
.
With
some
aim,
AP
Ezreal
can
easily
harass
and
burst
enemies
down
safely
behind
minions.
Remember
that
Arcane
Shift
can
be
used
to
jump
terrain
spots
and
walls
in
the
jungle.
It
is
your
best
escape
mechanism.
Be
careful
using
it
offensively
in
a
skirmish
as
people
will
know
to
focus
you
while
it's
on
cooldown.
Take
note
of
the
surrounding
area.
If
Ezreal
is
low
on
health
and
tries
to
Arcane
Shift
over
a
wall,
the
escape
attempt
may
hurt
you
if
the
homing
missile
targets
a
jungle
monster
and
pulls
aggro.
The
missile
will
track
the
closest
target
after
Ezreal
uses
Arcane
Shift
.
Keep
this
in
mind
when
using
the
skill
offensively
near
enemy
minions.
Use
Arcane
Shift
to
help
line
up
your
other
abilities,
but
avoid
using
it
in
situations
that
would
leave
you
vulnerable.
You
can
line
up
Trueshot
Barrage
to
hit
multiple
minion
waves
or
monsters.
Do
not
hesitate
to
use
Trueshot
Barrage
to
just
farm
a
creep
wave
or
defend
a
turret
.
By
spamming
Mystic
Shot
,
the
cooldown
for
Trueshot
Barrage
will
come
back
up
very
quickly.
With
maxed
cooldown
reduction
,
its
cooldown
can
end
up
as
low
as
30
seconds.
Trueshot
Barrage
can
be
used
at
the
beginning
of
a
team
fight
to
instantly
gain
5
stacks
of
Rising
Spell
Force
.
Trueshot
Barrage
takes
approximately
12
seconds,
from
the
start
of
casting
time,
to
reach
the
enemy
summoning
circle
from
your
own.
Ezreal
benefits
from
the
two
neutral
buffs
more
so
than
most
ADCs.
Crest
of
the
Ancient
Golem
allows
Ezreal
to
use
his
skills
with
impunity
and
Blessing
of
the
Lizard
Elder
allows
him
to
kite
with
Mystic
Shot
.
With
some
vision
control,
Trueshot
Barrage
can
be
used
to
steal
the
enemy's
own
buffs.
With
perfect
timing
and
ward
placement,
Trueshot
Barrage
can
be
also
used
to
steal
away
a
Dragon
kill
or
even
Baron
Nashor
.
Trueshot
Barrage
can
be
saved
for
teamfights
or
1v1
situations
to
finish
off
enemies
as
they
run
away.
Since
the
range
is
global
and
does
massive
amount
of
damage
you
can
kill
low
health
enemies
with
a
well-aimed
ultimate.
Never
forget
that
Trueshot
Barrage
is
global
and
you
may
be
able
to
snipe
a
enemy
champion
from
all
the
way
across
the
map
if
you
have
good
aim.
You
can
also
use
it
to
soften
up
a
enemy
that
you
are
aiming
to
fight.
Having
teammates
with
good
CC
like
Leona
or
Amumu
can
make
it
much
easier
to
land
your
skills
and
make
the
enemy
take
the
full
brunt
of
your
Trueshot
Barrage
.
If
you
decide
to
snipe
a
fleeing
enemy,
make
sure
they
don't
have
any
sort
of
heal,
shield,
or
invulnerability.
While
Trueshot
Barrage
has
high
base
damage,
the
falloff
could
be
the
deciding
factor
in
getting
a
kill;
to
get
the
most
out
of
it,
try
to
hit
your
target
without
it
hitting
minions.
Use
Trueshot
Barrage
when
the
enemy
has
no
vision
of
Ezreal
so
that
they
will
be
unable
to
warn
their
teammates.
Note
that
Trueshot
Barrage
can
be
seen
through
the
fog
of
war,
so
a
wary
opponent
can
watch
for
it
and
avoid
it
from
a
distance.
Trueshot
Barrage
has
a
channel
time
upfront
and
is
easily
dodged
by
skilled
players.
For
this
reason,
it
is
often
a
good
idea
to
use
it
to
hit
an
entire
team
immediately
after
the
battle
starts,
dealing
significant
total
damage
and
granting
multiple
stacks
of
Rising
Spell
Force
.
Trueshot
Barrage
is
especially
powerful
in
Dominion,
delaying
enemies'
attempts
to
capture
your
towers
and
buying
crucial
time.
Due
to
its
relatively
low
cooldown
in
conjunction
with
Mystic
Shot
,
use
it
wisely
and
use
it
often.
Smart
casting
will
give
you
a
faster
response
time,
allowing
you
to
hit
more
abilities.
Smart
casting
Arcane
Shift
can
help
you
dodge
a
lot
of
otherwise
deadly
situations.
Build
usage
Mystic
Shot
deals
physical
damage.
Stacking
up
on
armor
penetration
runes
greatly
increase
the
damage
this
skill
deals,
especially
in
the
lower
levels.
Ezreal
has
several
options
regarding
using
armor
penetration
and
armor
reduction
in
all
of
his
builds
(Mind
the
notes
regarding
armor
penetration
):
The
Brutalizer
is
a
good
early
item
for
an
attack
damage
or
hybrid
(
attack
damage
and
ability
power
)
build,
granting
attack
damage,
armor
penetration,
and
cooldown
reduction.
The
Black
Cleaver
can
be
used
as
an
all-around
item
complementing
well
into
mid
to
late-phase.
While
a
less
to
not-effective
option
for
ability
power,
its
strength
for
Mystic
Shot
and
improving
auto-attacks
with
attack
damage
and
armor
reduction
make
it
a
good
item
against
low
-
mid
armor
champions.
Last
Whisper
complements
Ezreal
for
Mystic
Shot
and
attack
damage.
While
less-useful
for
regular
auto-attack
than
The
Black
Cleaver
,
the
armor
penetration
is
the
strongest
against
mid-high
armor
stacking
champions,
it
is
an
amazing
item
against
tougher
enemies.
Its
low
cost
makes
it
an
affordable
purchase
in
the
early-phase.
However,
it's
not
exactly
suitable
for
ability
power
and/or
hybrid
builds
as
Youmuu's
Ghostblade
is.
You
can
play
Ezreal
either
as
a
ranged
physical
or
caster
damage
per
second
depending
on
how
you
build
him.
Physical
damage
per
second
plays
like
a
ranged
damage
per
second,
utilizing
autoattacks,
Mystic
Shot
and
Trueshot
Barrage
for
burst
damage,
and
other
abilities
for
utility
and
supplementary
damage.
Caster
damage
per
second
plays
like
an
area
of
effect
caster,
utilizing
Essence
Flux
and
Trueshot
Barrage
to
damage
multiple
targets
in
battles
while
using
Mystic
Shot
for
supplementary
damage
and
cooldown
reduction.
If
you
get
Wriggle's
Lantern
you
can
turn
Ezreal
into
a
very
fast
jungler
and
increase
his
farming
considerably.
Tear
of
the
Goddess
is
a
good
item
early
game
(upgrading
to
Manamune
or
Archangel's
Staff
later
on)
if
you
run
out
of
mana
too
quickly.
The
casting
of
Mystic
Shot
procs
Sheen's
damage
buff,
which
is
then
applied
when
the
shot
hits
the
target,
thus
increasing
its
damage.
If
you
miss
Mystic
Shot
,
auto
attack
the
enemy
once
before
casting
Mystic
Shot
again.
The
same
applies
for
using
other
abilities
before
casting
Mystic
Shot
,
as
not
using
the
Sheen
can
decrease
DPS
considerably.
Phage
/
Trinity
Force
improve
his
kiting
ability.
Alternatively,
Iceborn
Gauntlet
provides
an
area
slow
when
hitting
any
enemy
with
Mystic
Shot
,
great
for
pinning
down
or
separating
teams.
If
using
a
primarily
AP
build,
Lich
Bane
will
scale
better
than
Trinity
Force
or
Iceborn
Gauntlet
.
Guinsoo's
Rageblade
can
be
stacked
quickly
using
Mystic
Shot
.
On
cast,
it
procs
one
stack,
and
procs
a
second
stack
if
it
hits
the
target.
Mystic
Shot
cannot
critically
strike,
so
building
items
like
Infinity
Edge
would
be
less
effective
than
building
an
item
like
The
Bloodthirster
unless
you
are
unable
to
maintain
stacks.
When
building
AP,
Morellonomicon
and
Ionian
Boots
of
Lucidity
will
boost
your
damage
output
by
providing
35%
CDR,
75
AP,
and
12
MP5.
Depending
on
what
you
build,
Ezreal
can
choose
to
pick
up
an
Archangel's
Staff
,
Manamune
or
both.
Within
the
preparation
phase
of
Dominion
in
the
early
1:20
minutes,
Ezreal
can
start
collecting
Mana
with
Tear
of
the
Goddess
by
keeping
every
ability
on
Cooldown
.
This
can
serve
as
a
minor
improvement
for
the
early
phases.
While
the
bonus
Mana
pool
of
Archangel's
Staff
and
Manamune
are
the
same,
they
compliment
each
other
very
well.
Getting
both
requires
a
high
level
of
farm
though.
Nevertheless,
each
item
is
very
useful
if
quickly
farmed
and
can
be
a
fundamental
part
of
most
builds.
Mystic
Shot
can
trigger
Lich
Bane
's
passive,
making
it
a
core
item
on
any
AP
build
since
it
increases
Mystic
Shot
's
AP
ratio
from
.2
to
.95
(in
addition
to
an
extra
50
base
magic
damage)
and
a
spellsword
mastery
will
top
Mystic
Shot
to
a
1
to
1
AP
ratio.
With
Nashor's
Tooth
your
Mystic
Shot
can
be
even
better
-
up
to
1.15
AP
ratio.
Nashor's
Tooth
is
perfect
for
both
AD
or
AP
Ezreal
as
it
provides
Attack
Speed
,
Cooldown
Reduction
to
continuously
spam
Mystic
Shot
and
Ability
Power
to
increase
all
Ezreal's
ability
damage,
and
all
for
a
relatively
low
cost.
Quicksilver
Sash
,
Mercurial
Scimitar
,
or
Cleanse
are
useful
for
Ezreal
,
allowing
him
to
escape
enemy
crowd
control
effects
and
reposition
in
teamfights.

Countering
Ezreal
is
fairly
squishy
at
early
game.
Harassing
him
early
will
hinder
his
gold
and
experience
gain.
Three
of
his
spells
deal
magic
damage.
Buying
a
Negatron
Cloak
or
Mercury's
Treads
early
will
help
you
mitigate
his
damage
if
he
builds
towards
those
spells.
Ezreal's
Trueshot
Barrage
has
a
global
range.
Take
care
when
recalling
when
your
health
is
low.
The
projectile
can
be
seen
through
fog,
watching
the
map
while
recalling
can
help
you
notice
it
soon
enough
to
move
out
of
the
way.
Although
Trueshot
Barrage
is
a
channeled
ability,
you
cannot
stop
the
channel
with
hard
CC.
The
only
way
to
prevent
him
from
ulting
mid-cast
is
by
killing
him.
All
of
Ezreal's
abilities
are
skill
shots
.
Buying
movement
speed
items
will
make
it
easier
to
evade
his
spells.
When
dueling
an
Ezreal
as
Ezreal
,
try
using
Arcane
Shift
to
dodge
their
first
Mystic
Shot
.
Immediately,
you
are
in
a
good
place
to
chase
them,
have
dealt
more
damage,
built
a
stack
on
Rising
Spell
Force
,
and
have
a
cooldown
advantage.
If
you
can
dodge
Mystic
Shot
while
they
are
casting
Essence
Flux
,
you
will
have
an
even
greater
advantage.
For
this
reason,
be
careful
using
Arcane
Shift
offensively
against
another
Ezreal
.
Ezreal
cannot
trade
fairly
during
close
combat
and
relies
heavily
on
poking.
Having
a
champ
that
can
dash
or
blink
towards
him
(ie
Xin
Zhao
,
Diana
,
Irelia
)
would
cost
Ezreal
his
blink
to
run
away
from
the
team
fight
and
be
isolated
from
the
defending
allies
causing
his
death.
Pure
AP
Ezreal
suffers
from
a
weak
early
game;
his
burst
is
very
mana-intensive,
he
loses
his
only
non-flash
escape-skill
when
using
Arcane
Shift
offensively,
he
cannot
reliably
push
a
lane
and
he
lacks
any
kind
of
crowd
control
effects.
In
exchange,
he
becomes
a
very
high
damage
dealer
in
the
mid
and
lategame
due
to
his
high
AP-scalings
and
massive
AoE-damage.
In
this
case,
it
is
even
more
effective
to
dodge
his
skillshots
by
moving
erratically.
In
teamfights,
try
to
spread
out
so
he
cannot
hit
the
whole
team
with
his
Trueshot
Barrage
+
Essence
Flux
-combo.
