Backdooring
(also
BDing
or
BD
)
is
the
commonly
used
term
for
a
strategy
whereupon
one
or
more
champions
will
attack
the
enemy
team's
structures
such
as
turrets
,
inhibitors
,
or
the
Nexus
without
the
support
of
their
friendly
minion
wave.
In
other
words,
sneaking
into
the
enemy
base
without
having
pushed
the
lane
first.

Strategy
The
benefit
of
the
strategy
lies
in
the
element
of
surprise.
Champions
have
the
opportunity
to
notice
when
a
lane
is
being
pushed
and
can
move
to
defend
it
before
the
enemy
reaches
a
turret,
whereas
backdooring
can
allow
the
turret
to
be
destroyed
before
the
defending
team
has
a
chance
to
react.
It
is
by
common
sense
for
the
backdoorer(s)
to
get
to
the
turret
via
the
jungle,
however
players
can
also
backdoor
down
a
lane
if
the
minions
are
right
up
to
the
turret.
If
the
backdooring
player
is
losing,
they
could
possibly
flash
over
one
of
the
walls
around
their
base,
as
moving
through
the
lanes
means
a
risk
of
getting
spotted
by
the
enemy
team.
The
main
aim
of
backdooring
is
to
destroy
inhibitors
but
can
be
used
on
all
buildings
as
long
as
the
backdoorers
have
a
support
or
a
tank.
Alistar
is
a
good
pick
especially
when
teamed
with
a
pusher
like
Master
Yi
or
Nasus
.
Since
structures
are
unaffected
by
critical
strikes,
lifesteal,
armour
penetration,
and
all
item-based
on-hit
effects
(except
for
Sheen
,
Lich
Bane
and
Trinity
Force
),
only
Attack
Damage,
Attack
Speed,
Health
Points
and
Armour
are
effective
against
a
structure.
Risks
Backdooring
is
generally
seen
as
a
high-risk
high-reward
tactic,
as
in
order
to
attack
the
tower
without
friendly
creeps
nearby
a
champion
must
tank
the
tower's
damage
her/himself.
There
is
also
the
danger
of
being
alone
deep
within
the
enemy's
territory,
so
the
ability
to
escape
in
the
event
of
being
attacked
is
reduced.
Turrets
also
take
half
damage
from
enemy
champions
when
there
are
no
enemy
creeps
nearby,
a
mechanic
specifically
designed
to
make
backdooring
a
turret
more
difficult
(inhibitors
and
the
Nexus
do
not
have
this
trait).
Countering
If
a
team
expects
their
enemy
to
attempt
a
backdoor
they
will
often
leave
one
or
more
champions
to
ambush
any
would-be
backdoorers.
Doing
this
without
a
backdoorer,
however,
may
hinder
the
team's
efficiency
in
attack.
Alternatively,
Sight
Wards
can
be
placed
at
possible
infiltration
points
to
see
champions
attempting
to
backdoor
before
they
reach
their
target.
This
can
be
expensive
as
there
are
many
possible
infiltration
points
and
wards
only
last
3
minutes.
Additionally,
the
more
expensive
Vision
Wards
will
have
to
be
purchased
against
stealth
champions
like
Twitch
and
Evelynn
.
Instead
of
wards,
a
cheaper
and
equally
effective
counter-tactic
is
to
use
champion
trap-like
abilities,
the
most
obvious
and
effective
one
being
Teemo
's
mushrooms.
Champion
Use
Abilities
with
long
range
teleports
such
as
Twisted
Fate's
Destiny
and
Pantheon's
Grand
Skyfall
are
particularly
suited
to
backdooring
as
they
can
quickly
teleport
to
an
enemy
tower
when
they
know
enemy
champions
are
unable
to
defend
it;
their
teleports
also
make
them
excellent
at
preventing
the
enemy
from
backdooring.
Stealth
champions
such
as
Twitch
and
Evelynn
are
also
good
backdoorers
due
to
their
ability
to
enter
the
enemies
territory
unnoticed,
and
escape
with
stealth
once
the
backdoor
is
complete.
Reception
Backdooring
is
considered
unsportsmanlike
by
some
players
and
is
especially
frowned
upon
by
casual
players.
Some
players
actively
"ban"
the
strategy
when
playing
their
own
custom
games.
The
majority
of
competitive
players,
however,
accept
backdooring
as
being
a
legitimate
strategy
and
there
are
no
bans
against
it
in
matchmaking
or
ranked
games.
Trivia
The
term
"backdooring"
was
originally
coined
by
players
of
a
host
of
strategy
games
such
as
Warcraft
and
Age
of
Empires
.
"Frontdoor"
can
be
used
for
directly
attacking
an
enemy
turret.
Backdooring
the
nexus
is
sometimes
known
as
"Pulling
an
xPeke",
since
xPeke
of
Fnatic
backdoored
the
nexus
against
SK
Gaming
at
IEM
Katowice.
