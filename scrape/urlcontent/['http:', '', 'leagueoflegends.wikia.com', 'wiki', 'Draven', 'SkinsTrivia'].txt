Trivia
Draven
was
designed
by
Volty
.
[1]
Draven
is
voiced
by
Erik
Braa
,
Who
also
voices
Jax
and
Vel'Koz
In
Old
English,
Draven's
name
means
"Hunter".
Draven
is
one
of
the
8
champions
who
does
not
have
a
single
skill
that
scales
off
ability
power,
the
others
being
Darius
,
Zed
,
Garen
,
Olaf
,
Riven
,
Talon
,
Vayne
.
Draven's
dance
is
the
fire
dance
.
It
is
also
the
first
dance
to
have
the
champion
talk
while
dancing.
This
dance
is
shared
with
Thresh.
Draven's
name
and
overall
aesthetics
is
similar
to
Kraven,
the
Hunter
,
from
the
Spiderman
comics.
In
his
Champion
Spotlight,
Draven
was
not
played
by
"Phreak"
like
the
other
champion
spotlights.
When
Draven
recalls
or
teleports,
he
strikes
a
pose
identical
to
Usain
Bolt's
signature
pose.
When
Draven
strikes
his
recall
pose,
he
points
toward
his
respective
summoner's
platform
or
towards
where
he
is
teleporting.
Draven's
tendencies
as
an
executioner
are
similar
to
that
of
two
famous
real-life
executioners:
Souflikar
,
a
Turkish
executioner
who
would
challenge
his
victims
to
a
race,
and
Richard
Brandon
,
an
English
executioner
who
excited
the
crowd
by
killing
his
victims
in
a
single
blow.
Draven
can
catch
the
enemy
team's
Draven's
spinning
axe
and
gain
the
buff.
If
you
recall
or
teleport
while
the
Spinning
Axe
buff
is
still
active,
the
axe
that
was
spinning
at
the
time
will
still
spin
when
Draven
puts
it
on
his
back
until
the
buff
is
gone.
Draven's
death
animation
is
likely
a
reference
to
the
enigmatic
ending
of
Cowboy
Bebop
in
which
the
main
character
makes
the
same
finger
pistol
motion
as
Draven
and
says
"Bang"
before
collapsing,
which
Draven
reproduces
down
to
the
thumb-hammer
motion.
Draven
and
his
brother
Darius
share
the
exact
same
base
attack
speed
and
attack
speed
scaling.
Draven's
innate
ability,
League
of
Draven
,
replaced
his
original,
Wicked
Blades
,
in
patch
3.9.
At
that
same
time,
Draven's
difficulty
rating
increased
to
100
from
60,
making
him
the
fourth
and
only
non-mage
champion
with
100
difficulty
rating.
Draven
won
GameFAQs'
Character
Battle
IX
contest.
Draven
is
the
fourth
champion
to
currently
have
a
difficulty
rating
of
100,
the
first
being
Cassiopeia
,
the
second
being
Orianna
,
and
the
third
being
Syndra
.
Although
Draven
was
released
before
Syndra,
he
was
not
assigned
a
difficulty
rating
of
100
until
long
after
Syndra's
release.
His
original
difficulty
rating
was
60.
When
Draven
kills
a
champion,
there
is
a
special
effect
that
rains
coins
of
gold
down
on
Draven.
This
effect
represent
the
gold
earned
from
his
passive
ability,
League
of
Draven
.
The
weapons
that
Draven
wield
are
called
"Noxian
Double
Axe'erang
Chucks".
Quotes
Draven
is
the
first
champion
to
have
a
special
quote
when
using
Recall
or
Teleport
.
While
Draven
was
the
first
champion
to
emit
a
quote
when
recalling,
Darius
was
the
first
to
have
a
special
animation.
Draven
is
the
only
champion
with
a
quote
and
effect
made
to
specifically
interact
with
himself.
He
emits
a
quote
when
he
catches
another
Draven's
axe.
His
quote
"Welcome
to
the
League
of
Draven"
has
become
a
meme,
in
which
people
photoshop
Draven's
face
onto
other
champions.
Draven
shares
a
quote
with
Jax
:
"Let's
do
this.
"
He
shares
a
quote
with
Nunu
Bot:
"Man,
I'm
good.
"
Skins
The
Soul
Reaver
skin
bears
a
striking
resemblance
to
the
Turian
race
from
the
Mass
Effect
,
especially
the
Reaper-converted
Marauders.
In
addition,
Soul
Reaver
Draven's
armor
is
somewhat
similar
to
the
Daedric
Armor
of
the
Elder
Scrolls
franchise,
especially
in
its
Skyrim
iteration.
Prior
to
the
information
of
the
Gladiator
skin
leaked
from
public
beta
,
a
similar
skin
concept
for
Draven,
"Firedancer",
has
been
published
by
the
player
Spookypatrol
(deviantART
user
"Dargonite")
in
the
official
North
American
forum.
Five
Riot
employees
expressed
interest
to
the
idea
in
two
separate
threads.
[2]
The
skin
is
also
used
to
celebrate
the
Italian
localization
of
the
client,
24
March
2013.
The
Gladiator
skin
possesses
3
special
quotes
available
only
in
Italian
which
are
references
to
the
movie
"Gladiator".
"Al
mio
segnale,scatenate
Draven!"
which
can
be
translated
to
"At
my
signal,
unleash
Draven!"
"Date
a
Draven
ciò
che
è
di
Draven...
E
anche
tutto
il
resto!"
which
means
"Give
Draven
what
Draven
owns...
and
everything
else."
,
based
on
the
popular
sentence
"Give
Caesar
what
Caesar
owns."
"Ciò
che
Draven
fa
in
vita,riecheggia
nell'eternità...Già"
that
means
"What
Draven
does
in
life,
echoes
through
eternity."
Relations
Draven
is
Darius'
younger
brother.
The
two
together
were
known
as
"The
Blood
Brothers",
The
use
of
Blood
Brothers
in
this
context
is
no
relation
to
the
common
usage,
which
is
where
two
non-related
males
perform
a
"blood
pact".
The
term
"The
Blood
Brothers"
was
likely
used
due
to
them
both
utilizing
bleed
damage.
However,
the
significance
of
the
term
was
diminished
when
Wicked
Blades
was
removed.
According
to
his
page
on
the
beta
League
of
Legends
website,
Draven's
relations
list
him
as
friends
with
himself.
