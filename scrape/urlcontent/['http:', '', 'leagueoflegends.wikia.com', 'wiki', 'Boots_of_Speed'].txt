The
Boots
of
Speed
are
a
basic
item
in
League
of
Legends
.
[1]
Every
champion
,
regardless
of
build,
should
buy
some
type
of
boots.
They
decrease
the
time
it
takes
to
get
around
and
greatly
aid
in
both
chasing
and
running
from
enemy
champions.
Cost

of
Speed
is
the
item

a
value
of

Trivia
The
movement
speed
bonus
of
Boots
of
Speed
and
anything
that
it
builds
into
does
not
stack.
Boots
of
Speed
is
the
only
basic
item
which
increases
your
movement
speed
.
While
playing
Cassiopeia
or
Nami
,
one
can
bring
up
Boots
of
Speed
in
the
shop
by
searching
for
"Hat".
Strategy
This
item
can
be
used
as
a
starter
item
(along
with
Health
Potion
s)
on
every
champion,
especially
those
who
require
high
mobility.
However,
since
the
item
does
not
give
defensive
or
offensive
stats,
you
must
take
extra
care
with
enemy
champions.
Many
advanced
players
take
boots
as
a
starting
item
for
midlane
to
dodge
enemy
skillshot
abilities.
