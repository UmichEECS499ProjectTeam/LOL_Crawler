The
Blessing
of
the
Lizard
Elder
is
a
neutral
buff
available
on
Summoner's
Rift
.
The
buff
can
be
identified
by
spinning
red
runes
and
a
red
runed
circle
around
the
champion.
Because
of
this
it
is
often
referred
to
as
the
"red
buff"
or
just
"red".
The
damage
dealt
is
true
damage
.
This
makes
it
valuable
in
killing
champions
who
have
high
armor
and
magic
resistance
.

How
to
obtain
On
Summoner's
Rift
,
by
killing
the
Lizard
Elder
(from
which
its
name
is
derived).
By
killing
a
champion
that
currently
possess
this
buff.
In
this
case,
the
duration
of
the
buff
is
refreshed.
Strategy
As
of
V1.0.0.130
,
the
red
buff
slows
(8/16/24)%
for
melee
characters
and
(5/10/15)%
for
ranged
characters
at
levels
(1/6/11).
This
makes
the
buff
more
effective
when
utilized
by
melee
characters
such
as
Xin
Zhao
,
Udyr
,
or
Tryndamere
than
it
does
for
ranged
attackers
such
as
Tristana
and
Ezreal
.
Note
however
that
it
is
easier
for
ranged
champions
to
apply
the
slow
without
getting
in
dangerous
situations
and
they
can
also
use
it
to
keep
melee
attackers
at
a
distance.
The
jungler
will
most
likely
take
the
red
buff
early
in
the
game.
The
extra
damage
lets
the
jungler
clear
minion
packs
easier
and
take
on
bigger
monsters
like
the
Dragon
.
The
slow
from
the
buff
is
extremely
valuable
for
the
jungler
to
successfully
execute
a
gank.
The
slow
from
the
buff
stacks
with
all
other
effects
that
would
reduce
the
target's
movement
speed
,
except
another
red
buff.
For
example
if
you
are
carrying
a
Frozen
Mallet
and
have
the
red
buff,
both
slows
will
be
applied
to
the
target.
However,
if
the
red
buff
slow
is
weaker
it's
reduced
by
65%,
and
it's
just
a
(2.8/5.6/8.4)%
slow
for
melee
attacks
or
(1.75/3.5/5.25)%
for
ranged
attacks.
If
the
red
buff
slow
is
stronger,
the
other
slowing
effect
will
be
reduced
by
65%
If
you
are
a
ranged
attacker
with
both
Frozen
Mallet
and
the
red
buff.
Attacking
an
enemy
reduces
its
speed
to
(1
−
0.3)
×
(1
−
0.15
×
0.35)
=
0.7
×
0.9475
=
66.325%
of
his
original
movement
speed.
Increasing
attack
speed
does
not
increase
true
damage
dealt
by
the
red
buff,
as
the
damage
is
applied
as
a
non-stacking
damage
over
time
effect.
Syndra's
Force
of
Will
can
be
used
on
the
Lizard
Elder
to
quickly
apply
the
debuff
to
a
nearby
enemy
champion.
