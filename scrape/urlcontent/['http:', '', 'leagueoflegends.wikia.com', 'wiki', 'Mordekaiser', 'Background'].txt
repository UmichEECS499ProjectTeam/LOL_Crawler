Mordekaiser
is
a
being
of
pure,
living
agony
on
a
mysterious
dread
quest.
It
is
said
that
he
was
the
first
of
the
undead,
existing
before
the
Shadow
Isles
were
a
whispered
threat.
His
true
name
and
past
lost
to
history,
Mordekaiser
is
feared
for
his
grim
manipulation
of
pain
–both
his
own,
and
that
of
others.
Anguish
fuels
and
sustains
him,
serving
as
his
last
connection
to
life,
as
well
as
his
most
effective
weapon.
In
his
enigmatic
hunt,
he's
proven
no
one
is
safe,
for
even
the
most
courageous
souls
have
surrendered
their
secrets
in
his
grasp.
One
girl
witnessed
and
survived
an
encounter
with
pain's
paladin.
Late
one
night,
the
young
mage-in-training
was
awoken
by
the
sound
of
her
master's
tortured
screams.
Overcoming
her
fear,
she
charged
into
the
library
to
find
it
a
shattered
ruin.
There,
she
saw
a
hulking
figure
clad
in
a
suit
of
armor
that
seemed
fused
to
his
body.
It
was
clear
the
grim
intruder
was
looking
for
something,
and
was
displeased
with
the
results.
At
the
center
of
the
once-majestic
chamber,
the
armored
fiend
clutched
her
teacher's
broken
form.
She
overheard
her
master's
final
words
–
that
he
would
die
before
he
would
give
up
his
secrets.
Mordekaiser
laughed
and
said
that
even
death
was
no
escape,
then
snapped
the
master's
neck
with
a
sharp
crack.
Moments
later,
the
horrified
girl
witnessed
her
master's
spirit
torn
from
his
body.
As
if
under
some
dark
compulsion,
the
shade
began
to
reveal
all
to
his
torturer
and
executioner.
The
girl
fled,
living
to
tell
her
story
–
should
Mordekaiser
come
for
you,
even
death
itself
will
not
keep
you
from
his
iron
reach.
"Fear
is
confusion,
pain
is
clarity."
―
Mordekaiser
During
the
most
recent
winter
solstice
–
when
no
other
night
during
the
year
is
longer
–
a
being
like
no
other
emerged
from
the
forgotten
alleyways
of
Noxus
.
Standing
eight
feet
tall,
and
concealed
within
a
razor-sharp
armored
shell,
he
came
to
be
known
only
as
Mordekaiser.
The
nature
of
what
lies
beneath
his
metallic
carapace
is
a
popular
subject
of
speculation.
Many
allege
that
he
is
a
mortal
man
with
a
heart
that
has
hardened
to
iron.
Others
insist
that
he
is
a
dark
specimen
of
the
undead.
But
there
are
some
who
whisper
warnings
that
he
is
merely
a
foreshadowing
of
something
terrible
and
unprecedented
yet
to
come.
Despite
the
public
conjecture
and
curiosity,
none
have
discovered
what
lies
beneath
his
alloyed
exterior.
What
is
known
is
this:
Mordekaiser
arrived
unannounced
at
the
Institute
one
day
and,
with
a
rasp
that
crept
ice
up
the
spines
of
all
within
earshot,
requested
to
join
the
League
of
Legends
.
Upon
glimpsing
his
fearful
visage,
most
keep
their
distance,
fortunately
unaware
that
his
touch
bears
a
sinister
scourge.
Those
who
stumble
within
his
grasp
fall
victim
to
incurable
maladies.
In
fact,
Mordekaiser
seems
mystically
attuned
to
sickness,
as
if
it
feeds
and
comprises
part
of
his
chilling
essence.
He
now
stalks
the
slums
of
Noxus,
drawn
to
the
plague-ridden
and
diseased.
However,
there
is
something
in
his
clever
tactics,
something
in
his
noble
stance,
and
something
in
the
tone
of
his
unearthly
commands
that
has
led
many
to
believe
that
Mordekaiser
is
more
than
just
a
foot
soldier.
Some
see
the
distinguishing
characteristics
of
a
general.
While
many
have
learned
to
accept
the
evidence
of
this
unsettling
possibility,
a
lingering
question
keeps
them
wary
at
the
witching
hour:
If
Mordekaiser
is
a
general,
what
nightmarish
legion
lurks
at
his
command?
"The
common
perception
is
that
the
encompassing
armor
protects
him,
I
fear
that
–
for
the
fragile
time
being
–
it
actually
protects
us."

Mordekaiser's
eligibility
evaluation
From
the
Shadow
Isles
comes
a
champion
like
no
other.
Standing
eight
feet
tall,
concealed
within
a
razor-sharp
armored
shell
is
a
creature
known
only
as
Mordekaiser.
Some
allege
that
he
is
a
man,
though
none
have
actually
seen
what
lies
within
the
plates
that
encompass
him.
There
are
those
who
posit
that
he
isn't
a
living
being,
but
rather
a
particularly
dark
specimen
of
the
undead
rumored
to
infest
his
distant
homeland
-
but
such
rumors
are
surely
merely
the
ramblings
of
the
paranoid
or
the
whispers
of
the
insane.
What
is
known
is
this:
Mordekaiser

and,

rasp
of
an
echoing
sepulcher,
requested
to

As
if
his
fearful
visage
doesn't
disturb
enough,
his
touch
bears
a
sinister
plague.
Those
unfortunate
enough
to
be
caught
within
his
grasp
fall

Champion
Sneak
Peek
Mordekaiser
was
first
released
on
the
Test
Realm
Client,
few
hours
after
making
the
announcement
of
his
introduction
to
League
of
Legends
:
Whether
you're
having
trouble
spotting
your
champion
during
those
hectic
team
fights,
or
you
just
happen
to
be
a
fan
of
awesome
juggernauts
in
massive
armor
carrying
gigantic
weapons,
we
may
have
a
solution
for
you.
Allow
me
to
introduce:
Mordekaiser.
If
you
have
ever
felt
that
your
champion's
aesthetic
could
be
vastly
improved
by
the
addition
of
plate
armor
covered
in
metal
spikes,
this
champion
should
definitely
scratch
that
itch.
