There
is
a
temple
hidden
in
the
mountains
between
Noxus
and
the
Tempest
Flats,
where
the
secrets
of
an
ancient
and
terrifying
sorcery
are
kept.
The
area
surrounding
the
temple
is
littered
with
the
exsanguinated
corpses
of
those
who
have
mistakenly
wandered
too
close.
These
served
only
to
pique
the
curiosity
of
Vladimir,
when
–
in
his
youth
–
he
trekked
through
these
mountains
during
his
flight
from
Noxus.
A
day
earlier,
the
teenaged
Vladimir
had
brutally
murdered
two
boys
of
his
age,
for
no
better
reason
than
to
enjoy
the
intoxicating
scarlet
bloom
that
surged
forth.
He
realized
immediately
that
he
would
never
be
able
to
suppress
his
murderous
desires,
and
if
he
remained
in
Noxus,
his
foul
deeds
were
sure
to
catch
up
with
him.
Without
hesitation,
he
abandoned
the
city-state,
and
journeyed
south.
The
trail
of
bodies
led
him
to
a
crumbling
stone
temple.
Inside
he
found
an
aging
monk
who
appraised
him
with
eyes
of
pure
crimson.
Vladimir
surprised
the
monk
by
returning
the
wicked
gaze
with
zeal.
Recognizing
the
boy’s
sinister
craving,
the
monk
taught
Vladimir
how
to
manipulate
and
control
the
fluid
of
life,
often
practicing
on
passing
travelers.
When
it
came
time
for
Vladimir
to
learn
the
final
lesson,
the
monk
warned
that
failure
would
result
in
death.
Vladimir
did
not
fail,
but
success
bore
a
grisly
surprise.
During
the
ritual,
every
drop
of
the
monk's
blood
was
drawn
from
his
body
and
fused
with
Vladimir's,
imbuing
him
with
his
master's
magical
essence,
and
that
of
every
hemomancer
before
him.
Left
alone
and
suddenly
without
purpose,
Vladimir
resolved
to
return
to
Noxus,
demanding
enrollment
in
the
League
to
prove
the
supremacy
of
his
craft.
When
the
Noxian
High
Command
observed
the
gruesome
fates
which
befell
the
palace
guards,
they
elected
to
avail
themselves
of
Vladimir's
unsavory
talents.
"That
which
runs
through
you
will
run
you
through."

Vladimir
