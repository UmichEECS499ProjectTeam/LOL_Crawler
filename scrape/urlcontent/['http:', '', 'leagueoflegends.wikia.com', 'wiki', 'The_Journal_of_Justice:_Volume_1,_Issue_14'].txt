Demacian
Miners
Trapped
in
Kalamanda
Miners’
fates
unknown
as
mithril
mine
collapses
from
recent
earthquake
Bob
Nashahago
reporting
from
Kalamanda
Village
Rescue
parties
rush
to
save
the
trapped
Demacian
miners
in
Kalamanda.
An
earthquake
rocked
the
village
of
Kalamanda
yesterday
evening,
causing
the
collapse
of
a
mithril
mine
and
trapping
twelve
Demacian
miners
underground.
Rescue
efforts
began
shortly
after
the
mine
caved
in,
though
no
announcement
of
progress
has
been
made
by
the
village.
No
other
damage
in
Kalamanda
was
reported.
The
collapse
occurred
during
the
early
morning
work
shift
at
the
#1
Loadstone
Mining
Consortium
(LMC)
mine,
which
is
the
site
of
Demacia’s
primary
mineral
extraction
operation
in
Kalamanda.
Reports
from
miners
who
narrowly
avoided
the
accident
indicate
that
there
was
initially
a
low
rumble
that
rapidly
grew
louder
emanating
from
deep
within
the
mine.
Shortly
after
the
rumbling
started,
the
main
mine
shaft
began
to
shake,
and
it
eventually
collapsed.
The
fates
of
the
twelve
miners
still
trapped
underground
remain
unknown.
The
tremor
also
released
huge
pockets
of
magical
energy
into
the
atmosphere,
prompting
immediate
concern
that
the
area
is
rapidly
becoming
unstable.
League
officials
descended
upon
Kalamanda
en
masse,
studying
the
causes
and
effects
of
the
catastrophe.
Finger
pointing
began
immediately
across
Valoran
;
rumors
that
the
quake
was
caused
by
the
rampant
influx
of
unregulated
mining
operations
and
environmentally
unsafe
mining
practices
by
Zaun
have
been
raised,
along
with
wilder
accusations
that
the
quake
was
deliberately
triggered.
The
Loadstone
Mining
Consortium
is
a
mining
company
owned
in
part
by
the
Demacian
royal
family.
It
had
just
conducted
safety
inspections
of
all
its
facilities
in
Kalamanda
before
yesterday’s
events.
“There
is
no
reason
whatsoever
that
the
#1
mine
should
have
collapsed
at
all,”
commented
Winston
Garnersham,
chief
overseer
of
the
LMC’s
Kalamanda
operations.
“Although
the
earthquake
was
unpredictable,
the
magnitude
of
the
shock
was
not
great
enough
to
cause
a
collapse.
That
mine
checked
out
across
the
board;
were
it
even
remotely
unsafe,
we
would
have
shut
it
down.
We
are
not
in
the
business
of
risking
the
lives
of
our
employees
for
profit.”
The
League
has
offered
assistance
to
Demacia
in
its
rescue
efforts,
as
have
the
small
contingencies
of
Piltover
and
Ionia
.
Help
has
even
been
offered
by
the
Noxian
delegation
in
Kalamanda
–
a
surprising
move
considering
the
animosity
between
Demacia
and
Noxus
in
recent
years.
Katarina
,
champion
of
the
League
and
the
Noxian
High
Command’s
representative
in
Kalamanda,
issued
the
following
statement
in
light
of
the
accident:
“Our
well-wishes
go
out
to
the
miners
who
are
currently
fighting
for
their
lives
in
the
collapsed
Loadstone
mine.
Such
business
is
dangerous,
especially
when
companies
may
be
tempted
to
risk
the
lives
of
others
in
unsafe
working
environments.
In
the
future,
Noxus
would
be
willing
to
share
the
expert
safety
practices
of
Noxian
mining
operations
with
the
other
city-states
working
in
Kalamanda.”
The
vast
mineral
wealth
uncovered
last
year
in
Kalamanda
has
been
steadily
exploited
by
city-states
and
independent
miners
alike.
Demacia
and
Noxus
are
the
two
city-states
with
the
largest
presence
in
Kalamanda,
with
both
setting
up
military
outposts
near
the
village.
The
village’s
elders
have
stated
in
no
uncertain
terms
that
they
are
looking
to
establish
an
exclusive
contract
with
a
single
city-state
for
future
mineral
exploitation,
though
no
final
decision
has
been
made
in
that
regard.
Both
Demacia
and
Noxus
are
thought
to
be
the
leading
contenders
for
securing
exclusive
mining
rights
in
Kalamanda.
Kassadin
Attacks
Malzahar
in
Attempt
to
Prevent
Sacrifice
Void
Walker
now
on
the
run
after
causing
massive
power
outage
Newton
Rook
reporting
from
Zaun
League
Champion
Kassadin
is
on
the
run
after
a
failed
attempt
to
prevent
a
sacrificial
ritual,
resulting
in
a
major
blackout
within
Zaun.
According
to
witnesses,
he
discharged
Void
energy
in
an
attempt
to
save
a
young
woman
from
being
sacrificed
at
the
hands
of
fellow
League
Champion
Malzahar
.
The
energy
was
sucked
into
a
hexvein
conduit
feeding
into
the
nexus
powering
the
southern
district,
causing
extensive
damage
that
will
take
Zaunite
techmaturgical
crews
several
days
to
repair.
Malzahar’s
presence
in
Zaun
attests
to
the
existence
of
a
growing
subculture
of
Void
worshippers.
The
self-proclaimed
“prophet”
is
still
met
with
intense
skepticism,
however,
with
Valoranian
leadership
equating
his
bodements
to
nattering
gossip.
Despite
his
extremist
views,
Malzahar
has
found
an
audience.
He
appeared
in
Zaun’s
southern
district
this
morning
with
several
hundred
cultist
followers,
chanting
in
an
unknown
dialect.
The
gathering
quickly
escalated
into
a
rally
of
both
void
worshippers
and
protesters
alike,
with
the
Prophet
floating
above
a
hexvein
power
node
in
the
center
of
the
crowd.
Onlookers
say
the
group
soon
carried
a
bound
young
woman
out
to
Malzahar,
over
whom
he
initiated
a
sacrificial
spell
and
caused
his
dagger
to
magically
levitate
above
her.
It
was
at
that
moment
that
Kassadin
abruptly
materialized,
dressed
in
full
League
regalia.
He
activated
his
sword
and
pointed
it
at
Malzahar.
A
participant
at
the
event,
who
refused
to
give
his
name,
recorded
the
exchange
between
the
champions.
We
transcribed
a
portion
of
it:
[Pulsing
sound
followed
by
shuffling
and
startled
screams]
Kassadin:
“Malzahar!
Get
away
from
her!
She
is
not
yours!”
Malzahar:
“Brother!
Enlightened
Walker
of
the
Path!
Join
us!”
Kassadin:
“Don’t
patronize
me,
mage!
You
threaten
the
balance!
Let
her
go!”
[Another
pulse
sound,
a
woman’s
scream,
and
a
small
explosion]
Malzahar:
“See
what
you’ve
done!
This
is
your
doing!”
Kassadin:
“No!”
[Static]
Our
source
described
what
happened:
“It
all
happened
very
fast.
Kassadin
appeared
just
like
Malzahar
said
he
would.
The
blast
that
Kassadin
sent
toward
the
Prophet
seemed
to
pull
itself
to
the
dagger
instead.
When
it
hit,
the
dagger
glowed
and
cut
a
hole
open
into
the
air.
Like
lightning,
a
shadow
grabbed
the
woman
and
dragged
her
in.
She
disappeared!
The
explosion
as
the
hole
closed
was
what
destroyed
that
power
node.”
Reports
say
the
Void
energy
explosion
was
not
large,
but
the
close
proximity
of
the
power
node
caused
it
to
absorb
the
majority
of
the
blast.
A
purple
glow
flowed
down
the
conduit,
causing
fluctuations
as
it
reached
the
nexus.
Zaun
Security
Supervisor,
Rhoman
Plath,
made
a
statement
soon
after:
“Void
Cultists
are
a
crock,
to
be
frank.
We
will
be
looking
into
the
incident,
but
sadly,
the
death
of
one
person
is
not
news
here
in
Zaun.
We
are
in
pursuit
of
Kassadin,
seeing
as
he
is
the
culprit
behind
the
blackout.
Unfortunately,
as
my
men
have
informed
me,
he
is
nearly
impossible
to
catch,
so
we
hope
he
will
come
forward
of
his
own
volition.
As
for
the
victim’s
identity,
our
initial
investigation
has
suggested
that
this
woman
may,
in
fact,
be
Kassadin’s
daughter.”

Janna
unveils
record-breaking
aircraft
for
competition
in
the
annual
airship
race
Henril
Dreving
reporting
from
the
Golden
Spire
in
Piltover
League
Champion
Janna
publicly
unveiled
her
new
record-breaking
zeppelin
at
Piltover’s
16th
annual
Festival
of
Flight.
While
it
is
difficult
to
classify
any
dirigible
as
small
(with
the
usual
dimensions
far
exceeding
that
of
many
of
Demacia’s
great
spires),
the
appropriately
named
“Tailwind”
aircraft
has
a
record-breaking
length
of
27
meters,
and
strikes
an
impressive
profile
with
its
gleaming
gold-trimmed
wingspan.
It
steals
the
title
of
smallest
operating
airship
from
Zaun’s
prized
“Lead
Zeppelin”,
which
measures
in
at
39
meters.
Not
only
is
Tailwind
the
first
zeppelin
to
meet
such
small
size
constraints,
but
it
also
pioneers
the
utilization
of
Piltoverian
Chrono-Technology.
The
new
prototype
“Chrono-propeller”
engine,
which
has
received
tremendous
design
contributions
from
fellow
League
Champion
Zilean
,
is
rumored
to
manipulate
time
itself
to
reach
speeds
that
would
otherwise
be
impossible
under
Valoran’s
constantly
changing
atmospheric
conditions.
Piltover
scientists
offered
very
little
information
on
the
specifics
of
the
design,
but
they
did
comment
that
it
would
be
decades
before
the
technology
was
perfected,
and
also
that
they
are
grateful
for
Janna’s
participation
in
testing
the
new
design.
Tensions
between
Piltover
and
Zaun
have
renewed
as
the
first
race
marking
the
beginning
of
the
annual
Techmaturgical
Conference
draws
near.
The
city
of
Zaun,
having
been
named
victor
of
the
symbolic
event
for
the
last
four
years
running,
showed
a
great
deal
of
trepidation
towards
the
upcoming
match
after
the
unveiling
of
Piltover’s
new
secret
weapon.
The
Tailwind
will
be
piloted
in
the
race
by
Janna,
who
was
once
one
of
Zaun’s
most
promising
mage
talents
before
defecting
from
the
city-state
several
years
ago.
The
starting
point
for
this
year’s
race
will
be
in
Piltover,
lending
a
greater
advantage
to
the
City
of
Progress.
The
course
will
direct
the
contestants
to
Zaun,
where
they
will
then
circle
the
entire
perimeter
of
the
city
before
returning
to
the
docking
pier
at
the
top
of
Piltover’s
central
spire.
It
is
commonplace
for
the
victorious
city
to
celebrate
for
several
days
before
returning
to
its
normal
functions,
and
it
is
said
that
the
last
Piltoverian
victory
celebration
was
so
loud
that
the
cheers
could
be
heard
from
within
the
walls
of
its
rival
city.

Senior
Summoner
Ralston
Farnsley
commenting
from
the
Institute
of
War
As
Runeterrans
settle
into
the
21st
year
of
the
Common
League
Era,
we
look
proudly
toward
the
beginning
of
the
third
decade
since
the
League’s
origination.
It
seems
we’ve
been
afforded
the
luxury
to
take
for
granted
a
world
without
war
raging
across
its
lands.
How
soon
since
we
faced
the
brink
of
annihilation
can
our
concerns
surround
the
day-to-day
affairs
of
our
favorite
celebrities,
the
champions
of
the
League
of
Legends.
“Two
champions
bring
me
the
most
inquiries
when
I
do
happen
to
go
about
town,
including
from
myself.
The
League
has
many
oddities,
but
the
most
odd
indeed
are
Annie
and
Amumu
,
by
far
the
youngest
champions
I
have
seen,
or,
in
Amumu's
case,
youngest
upon
death/undeath.
I
was
wondering
if
these
two
interact
on
a
regular
basis,
both
being
children?”
–
Krallna
As
two
champions
known
for
their
terrifying
raw
power
on
the
Fields
of
Justice,
Annie
and
Amumu
have
surprisingly
genteel
demeanors
in
their
daily
lives.
I
figured
it
best
to
take
your
query
straight
to
Annie,
as
Amumu
is
currently
visiting
Bandle
City
to
be
re-bandaged:
“Amumu
is
my
favorite
champion.
He’s
never
mean
like
some
of
the
others,
and
he
is
always
willing
to
make
friends.
We
play
sometimes
after
matches.
I
like
him
very
much.
I
hope
he
likes
me
too!
I
guess
everyone
thinks
he’s
gross
because
he’s
undead,
but
they
never
say
that
in
front
of
Tibbers
.”
“With
the
recent
liberated
provinces
of
Ionia
many
Ionians,
champions
and
summoners
have
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
that
Ionia
is
once
again
whole.
Being
a
role
model
to
me,
I
was
wondering
if
Master
Yi
would
be
willing
to
comment
his
thoughts
on
the
recent
liberation
of
the
Ionian
provinces?”
–
J.R
Kishi,
Ionian
Summoner
As
homage
to
Ram
Steed
,
who
we
are
very
happy
to
have
with
us
still
following
his
ordeal
with
Shaco
,
I’m
happy
to
bring
you
this
response
straight
from
the
source
–
Master
Yi.
“The
path
to
enlightenment
is
littered
with
trials,
and
it
is
in
these
times
when
we
may
discover
who
we
truly
are.
To
a
warrior,
however,
relief
is
an
emotion
as
distracting
as
panic.
Noxian
or
otherwise,
the
forces
we
now
face
have
ebbed,
but
just
as
the
tide,
they
will
flow
again.”
“I
have
spent
many
fights
where
I
have
decided
to
summon
Alistar
as
my
champion.
After
spending
so
long
with
this
great
warrior
I
had
to
start
wondering
if
he
has
ever
tried
to
contact
others
of
his
race
or
vice-versa.
I
hope
he
can
find
a
home
someday
and
would
even
like
to
see
more
of
his
savage
yet
noble
kind
in
the
League.”
–
Summoner
IronThane
Despite
his
fame
and
hulking
physique,
Alistar
avoids
the
spotlight
quite
effectively.
I
was
only
able
to
borrow
a
couple
moments
of
his
time
in
the
Adjudication
Wings
after
a
match
before
he
set
out
from
the
Institute
in
quite
a
hurry.
“The
minotaurs
of
the
Great
Barrier
live
on,
that’s
enough.
I
cannot
contact
them
for
fear
that
Noxian
agents
will
follow
me.
For
now,
I
worry
only
for
the
minotaurs
still
imprisoned
in
Noxian
camps.
I
hope
that
their
will
remains
unbroken.
Like
the
Ionians,
we
will
one
day
show
Noxus
how
powerful
the
spirit
of
the
minotaur
tribes
can
be.”
