Lore
Ionia
is
a
naturally
beautiful
island
nation
full
of
ancient
trees,
tall
mountains
and
tranquil
rivers.
The
entire
landscape
is
covered
with
large
patches
of
forests
teeming
with
life.
Locations
There
are
currently
12
places
known
in
Ionia.
The
Capital
of
Ionia,
the
Placidium,
located
in
the
south
western
part
of
Ionia
northwest
of
Navori;
Navori,
a
region
located
in
the
southern
part
of
Ionia's
mainland,
Galrin,
an
island
in
southernmost
part
of
Ionia
and
Shon-Xan,
east
of
the
Navori
region.
The
Lotus
Garden,
a
sacred
place
mainly
used
as
an
area
for
meditation,
is
located
in
the
northwest
part
of
the
Navori
region,
near
the
Placidium.
The
Serene
Garden,
the
garden
in
which
the
Great
Tree
grows
and
the
main
area
for
events,
and
the
Shojin
Monastery,
the
place
of
repentance,
are
found
inside
the
Placidium,
the
Hirana
Monastery,
of
which
monks
are
renowned
for
self-control,
located
somewhere
in
the
northeast
regions,
the
Kinkou
Order
,
an
ancient
clan
in
the
northwestern
island,
the
Temple

southern
regions,
the
Celestial
Fortress,
the
flying
castle

Syndra
,
currently
floating
somewhere
above
Ionia
and
the
Astral
Grove,
Soraka's
place
of
origin
and
previous
home
before
her
fall.
Although
it
exists
outside
of
Runeterra.
Culture
The
island
city-state
of
Ionia
is
a
haven
for
beings
who
seek
spiritual
evolution
and
enlightenment.
While
populated
primarily
by
humans,
some
yordles
and
beings
of
unique
origin
also
make
Ionia
their
home.
There
are
many
spiritual
centers
and
schools
of
enlightenment
in
Ionia,
each
one
working
in
harmony
with
one
another
to
find
the
answers
to
life’s
mystical
questions.
Why
are
we
here?
Who
are
we?
What
does
life
truly
mean?
Such
pursuits
leave
little
time
for
thoughts
of
imperialism;
the
Ionians
are
extremely
peaceful
by
nature.
The
Ionians
dedicate
their
lives
to
pursuing
spiritual
enlightenment
instead
of
conflict;
what
kind
of
enlightenment
is
up
to
the
individual.
The
mystics
of
Ionia
delve
into
many
mysteries,
pioneering
the
very
depths
of
spirituality.
While
many
of
them
devote
themselves
to
the
pursuit
of
peace
and
light,
there
are
those
who
walk
different
paths.
Some
pursue
the
beauty
of
perpetual
sorrow,
some
the
excitement
of
darkness,
some
the
vitality
of
the
primal.
Most
Ionians
find
violence
distasteful
and
try
not
to
resort
to
using
it
when
resolving
issues.
That
does
not
mean,
however,
that
they
are
helpless
or
unable
to
defend
themselves.
Diplomacy
is
an
art
in
Ionia,
and
Ionian
diplomats
are
revered
by
its
citizens.
Ionian
courts
are
known
all
across
Valoran
as
paradigms
of
fairness
and
neutrality,
so
much
so
that
Ionian
adjudicators
are
some
of
the
most
sought-after
by
the
League
of
Legends
.
Ionian
crest
Government
Ionia
has
one
of
the
most
unusual
governmental
structures
in
all
of
Runeterra.
This
is
partially
because
of
its
neutral
political
stance,
and
also
because
people
in
Ionia
have
generally
eschewed
conflict
in
favor
of
their
unending
quest
for
enlightenment.
The
power
and
wisdom
of
those
who
are
considered
blessed
or
enlightened,
such
as
Soraka,
the
Starchild
,
are
taken
into
account
with
a
great
amount
of
respect.
The
lack
of
military
involvement
has
prevented
Ionia
from
needing
a
single
defined
leader
such
as
the
other
city-states
have.
Instead,
Ionia
is
divided
into
provinces
which
are
each
represented
by
an
Elder.
To
determine
who
becomes
an
Elder,
a
competition
called
"The
Distinction"
is
held
every
five
years.
This
competition
has
several
trials
which
test
its
candidates
across
a
wide
array
of
skills.
Schools
in
each
region
send
their
finest
adepts
–
men
and
women
who
have
trained
their
bodies
and
minds
in
the
path
to
enlightenment
–
to
represent
them
in
the
Distinction.
The
prevailing
Elders
from
each
region
then
gather
at
the
Convergence
of
Elders
thrice
annually
or
whenever
any
Elder
calls
for
an
emergency
assembly.
Duchess
Karma,
the
Enlightened
One
,
resides
among
them.
Amazingly,
there
has
never
been
a
recorded
power
struggle
within
this
system,
but
this
is
generally
thought
to
be
due
to
the
Trial
of
Humility,
one
of
the
most
critical
and
revered
tests
in
the
Distinction.
Various
Sects
The
Ionians
have
created
some
of
the
most
remarkable
martial
art
forms
on
all
of
Runeterra
–
a
manifestation
of
their
pursuit
of
enlightenment.
The
Art
of
Hiten
is
a
blade
style
developed
by
the
famed
swordsman
Master
Lito.
His
art
was
a
highly-guarded
secret,
but
it
was
said
that
swords
would
breathe
in
his
grasp.
When
Master
Lito
died,
his
daughter
Irelia,
the
Will
of
the
Blades
,
inherited
the
Hiten
style.
Irelia
has
since
taken
the
art
form
to
new
heights
as
she
is
capable
of
telekinetically
commanding
multiple
blades.
The
weapons
dance
around
her
fluidly,
effortlessly
cutting
down
opponents
within
her
vicinity.
The
Art
of
Wuju
are
principles
founded
on
obtaining
absolute
spiritual
awareness
of
one's
self
and
one's
enemy.
Master
Yi,
the
Wuju
Bladesman
,
the
keeper
of
this
ancient
art,
descended
from
one
of
the
few
tribes
dedicated
to
the
preservation
of
Wuju.
Due
to
the
massacre
of
his
kin,
Master
Yi
is
now
one
of
the
last
Wuju
practitioners.
He
has
pledged
to
keep
the
Wuju
style
alive
by
teaching
the
art
form
to
other
individuals,
such
as
Wukong,
the
Monkey
King
.
The
Hirana
Monastery
is
home
to
many
monks
who
have
delved
to
the
deepest
depths
of
spirituality.
Their
adepts
are
some
of
the
most
devout
proponents
of
personal
harmony
within
one's
self.
Though
the
monks
deplore
violence,
they
are
not
defenseless
as
they
are
skilled
enough
to
turn
and
redirect
an
opponent's
strikes.
In
an
act
of
selflessness,
the
monks
took
in
Udyr,
the
Animal
Spirit
,
and
taught
him
how
to
harness
and
control
his
animalistic
fury...
most
of
the
time.
The
Kinkou
Order
exists
as
an
ancient
clan
originating
in
the
Ionian
Isles
dedicated
to
the
preservation
of
balance.
Order,
chaos,
light,
darkness
–
all
things
must
exist
in
perfect
harmony
for
such
is
the
way
of
the
universe.
The
Order
employs
a
triumvirate
of
shadow
warriors
to
uphold
its
causes
in
the
world.
The
three
shadow
warriors
Shen
,
Kennen
,
and
Akali
are
each
entrusted
with
one
of
three
sacred
duties:
Watching
the
Stars,
Coursing
the
Sun,
and
Pruning
the
Tree.
The
order,
however,
has
since
fallen
before
the
new
Order
of
the
Shadow.
The
Order
of
the
Shadow
is
a
new
clan
that
has
dedicated
themselves
to
learning
the
forbidden
art
of
the
shadows
and
killing
anyone
who
refuses
to
learn.
Their
leader,
Zed,
the
Master
of
the
Shadows
,
was
the
first
to
learn
the
technique
again
after
200
years.
By
using
the
art
of
the
shadows,
they
were
able
to
bring
down
the
ancient
order
of
the
Kinkou
and
have
since
used
their
lands
as
their
own
training
grounds.
The
Shojin
Monastery
is
home
to
peaceful
monks
that
have
long
practiced
the
martial
arts
of
inner
healing.
Through
meditation
the
monks
are
capable
of
rejuvenating
from
injuries
at
a
heightened
rate.
Some
of
these
priests
can
also
display
acts
of
incredible
willpower,
such
as
suffering
through
agonizing
amounts
of
pain
for
weeks
without
crying
out.
Lee
Sin,
the
Blind
Monk
,
resides
within
the
monastery,
having
journeyed
there
years
ago
in
hopes
of
obtaining
atonement
for
past
mistakes.
The
Pallas
Temple
Guardian
was
a
solitary
role
given
only
to
the
most
exceptional
Ionian
warriors.
Serving
as
the
temple's
warden,
the
Guardian
would
keep
watch
over
the
Pit
of
Pallas,
an
ancient
pit
of
corruption
so
vile
that
many
feared
it
could
envelop
the
island
in
darkness.
Sadly,
the
reclusive
position
no
longer
exists.
The
last
Guardian,
Varus,
the
Arrow
of
Retribution
,
allowed
himself
to
be
consumed
by
the
Pit's
black
flames,
obtaining
more
power
for
his
vengeance
against
Noxus.
Demographics
Ionia
is
a
place
visually
marked
by
numerous
gardens
and
temples.
Nature
preserves
and
parks
fill
the
Ionian
countryside.
A
serene
aesthetic
dominates
the
landscape,
even
at
its
harbor
and
in
its
industrial
sectors.
Buildings
are
constructed
with
the
goal
of
preserving
the
environment
as
much
as
possible.
All
of
Ionia’s
structures
are
ornately
decorated,
especially
the
temples.
Magic
is
used
liberally
in
the
city,
though
only
for
peaceful
purposes.
Several
of
the
city-states’s
largest
nexuses
have
been
shaped
into
prominent
temples
and
houses
of
communal
contemplation.
One
of
Ionia’s
most
iconic
structures
is
the
Placidium,
located
in
the
heart
of
the
city-state
atop
one
of
its
largest
nexuses.
This
building
is
home
to
the
School
of
Transcendentalism,
an
organization
dedicated
to
raising
Runeterra’s
populace
to
the
greatest
spiritual
heights
possible.
The
school
is
most
noted
for
having
the
League
champion
Soraka
as
part
of
its
governing
board
of
regents.
Beings
from
all
across
Runeterra
flock
to
the
school,
seeking
the
secrets
of
spiritual
enlightenment.
Many
of
Ionia’s
most
successful
diplomats
have
spent
at
least
some
time
studying
at
the
School
of
Transcendentalism.
Link
to
the
League
Ionia
is
known
for
its
reverence
of
balance,
and
this
also
extends
to
its
politics.
Ionia
was
not
an
original
member
of
the
League.
It
had,
and
continues
to
proclaim,
a
neutral
stance
in
the
political
affairs
of
Valoran.
However,
this
stance
has
not
excluded
them
from
conflict
with
the
mainland.
In
recent
times,
the
power-hungry
city-state
of
Noxus
turned
its
eye
toward
Ionia
for
the
purposes
of
conquest.
Noxus
launched
a
series
of
campaigns
to
conquer
the
seemingly
pacifistic
Ionians.
While
the
initial
stages
of
its
invasion
were
extremely
successful,
Ionia
eventually
rallied
a
defense
that
shocked
the
Noxian
High
Command.
Simultaneously,
Ionian
leaders
hastened
the
entry
of
Ionia
into
the
League,
preventing
Noxus
from
further
hostilities
outside
the
Fields
of
Justice.
Noxus
was
able
to
maintain
an
occupation
in
some
southern
Ionian
territories,
thanks
to
a
key
victory
over
Ionia
in
a
League
match
that
was
fought
to
determine
the
fate
of
the
conquered
lands.
After
seven
years,
Ionia
and
Noxus
battled
again
in
a
rematch
in
which
the
Ionians
obtained
victory,
reclaiming
their
southern
provinces.
History
Invasion
of
Noxus
When
the
League
was
first
formed,
Ionia
initially
refused
to
participate;
the
residents
preferred
to
pursue
personal
enlightenment
instead
of
waging
constant
battles
with
other
city-states.
The
militaristic
city-state
of
Noxus
saw
their
decision
as
an
opportunity.
No
longer
in
direct
war
with
Demacia
,
Noxus
had
turned
its
expansionist
eye
towards
conquering
those
who
remained
outside
of
the
League's
jurisdiction.
Noxian
spies
began
to
trade
aggressively
with
the
Ionians,
traveling
the
island
to
study
its
weaknesses
and
identify
critical
targets.
When
the
plan
was
formed,
the
forces
of
Noxus
struck.
The
southern
provinces
of
Ionia
were
the
most
open
to
trade
and
were
also
among
the
wealthiest.
It
was
there
that
the
Noxian
forces
landed
under
the
cover
of
night.
After
being
met
with
little
resistance,
Noxus’
forces
formed
their
first
beachheads
and
began
their
invasion.
While
the
war
was
heavily
in
the
favor
of
the
Noxian
forces,
the
Ionians
would
not
surrender.
In
response
to
a
growing
Ionian
resistance,
Noxus
brought
in
mercenaries
from
Zaun
.
The
mad
scientists
implemented
unspeakable
tactics,
unleashing
their
cruel
creations
on
non-combatant
civilians.
These
acts
of
terror
were
what
finally
brought
forth
the
full
anger
of
the
Ionians.
Bringing
all
its
might
and
martial
traditions
to
bear,
the
island
nation
fought
back
fiercely.
The
turning
point
of
the
war
came
at
the
"Great
Stand
of
the
Placidium",
where
the
Ionians
forced
the
Noxians
to
stop
their
advance
and
give
ground.
Though
they
suffered
high
casualties,
the
Ionian
warriors
eventually
brought
the
invaders
to
a
stalemate,
pushing
them
back
to
their
power
bases
on
the
island.
Despite
their
losses,
the
forces
of
Noxus
remained
in
control
of
three
of
the
wealthiest
southern
provinces
–
Galrin,
Navori,
and
Shon-Xan.
Varus
before
being
completely
corrupted.
The
Last
Guardian
Following
the
events
of
the
last
Noxian
Invasion,
Varus,
the
Pallas
Temple
Guardian,
returned
to
his
village
to
find
that
his
home
had
been
obliterated
during
the
invasion.
Varus
swore
vengeance
against
all
Noxians
but
needed
greater
power
to
fulfill
his
new
oath.
With
nothing
left
to
lose,
the
former
guardian
turned
to
the
Pit
of
Pallas
to
gain
the
requisite
strength
to
carry
out
his
vendetta.
The
Pit's
black
flames
consumed
his
body
and
transformed
him
into
a
creature
now
known
as
Varus,
the
Arrow
of
Retribution
.
Trial
for
the
Isle
From
left
to
right:
Galrin,
Navori,
and
Shon-Xan.
Seven
years
after
the
Noxian
invasion
began,
the
remaining
Ionian
Families,
brought
together
by
the
Duchess
Karma,
had
decided
that
there
was
only
one
recourse
left.
They
petitioned
to
join
the
League
of
Legends
in
order
to
drive
Noxus
out
once
and
for
all.
They
made
their
intentions
clear
stating
that
they
only
joined
the
League
in
order
to
ensure
Ionia's
future
security
within
the
world.
Their
membership
was
granted
and
the
match
was
set.
The
"Trial
for
the
Isle"
was
perhaps
one
of
the
most
famous
matches
of
all
time.
Unfortunately
for
the
Ionians,
they
lost,
albeit
amidst
questionable
circumstances.
Some
insist
that
Noxus’
victory
came
as
the
result
of
pre-match
tampering.
The
results
of
the
match
allowed
Noxian
forces
to
legitimately
occupy
the
southern
regions
of
Ionia.
Native
Ionians
were
treated
as
second-class
citizens
by
the
ruling
Noxian
elite.
Soldiers,
political
dissidents,
and
anyone
else
who
threatened
the
Noxians
were
interred
into
labor
camps.
Forces
continued
to
plunder
the
wealth
and
natural
resources
of
the
island,
sending
the
spoils
back
to
Noxus.
There
was
much
external
political
pressure,
particularly
on
the
part
of
Demacia,
for
the
invaders
to
leave.
The
Noxian
High
Command
claimed
they
remain
there
to
assist
the
island
nation's
future
development,
and
that
they
would
leave
once
Ionia
had
been
modernized
enough
to
economically
compete
in
the
world
and
protect
itself
from
foreign
threats.
The
Shadows
Released
An
orphan,
Zed
was
taken
in
and
trained
by
a
great
ninja
master.
Only
one
other
student
appeared
to
be
Zed's
equal
-
the
master's
son,
Shen
.
It
seemed
Zed
could
never
win
the
favor
of
the
master,
as
every
match
between
the
rivals
ended
in
a
draw.
Frustrated
and
jealous,
he
sought
an
advantage.
The
young
ninja
ventured
into
a
sealed
part
of
the
clan's
temple,
where
he
found
an
ornate,
foreboding
box.
Sensing
the
dark
knowledge
within,
Zed
knew
he
should
not
open
it,
but
he
peered
inside
nonetheless.
In
an
instant,
shadows
touched
his
mind,
revealing
techniques
that
had
long
been
hidden.
Now
armed
with
a
secret
edge,
he
challenged
Shen,
and
this
time
he
defeated
the
master's
son.
He
expected
praise
and
recognition
in
his
moment
of
victory,
but
somehow
the
master
knew
Zed
had
used
forbidden
ways,
and
banished
him.
Humiliated,
the
young
ninja
wandered
for
years.
His
bitterness
turned
to
ambition,
and
he
began
to
train
others
in
the
style
of
the
shadows.
But
he
knew
that
without
the
box
his
style
would
never
be
perfect
and
thus
he
swore
to
return
there
one
day
and
retrieve
the
box.
Protest
of
the
Shojin
Monk
The
protesting
Shojin
Monk
stopping
onlookers
from
trying
to
put
the
fire
out.
Eight
years
remained
before
southern
Ionia
could
challenge
Noxus
once
again
for
their
independence.
However,
protests
in
Ionia
were
on
the
rise,
particularly
due
to
the
self-immolation
of
the
Shojin
monk,
Lee
Sin
,
within
the
Lotus
Garden.
These
public
outcries
challenged
the
League’s
authority.
Ionians
claimed
that
fifteen
years
was
far
too
long
a
stay
to
grant
to
the
invaders,
and
that
Noxus
had
taken
advantage
of
the
newly-formed
League
when
the
ruling
was
made.
Demands
for
an
earlier
rematch
were
made
with
Irelia
,
the
Ionian
Captain
of
the
Guard,
at
the
helm
of
the
effort.
Despite
Noxian
protests
that
such
challenges
border
on
illegality,
Ionia
gained
much
support
in
the
court
of
public
opinion.
In
a
stunningly
direct
speech,
Prince
Jarvan
IV,
the
Exemplar
of
Demacia
,
spoke
out
against
the
Noxian
occupation.
He
stated
that
if
the
League
was
unwilling
to
remove
the
Noxians
from
the
island
nation,
then
he
planned
to
personally
visit
Ionia
himself.
Path
to
the
Rematch
Irelia
issues
her
demands
at
a
press
conference
in
Ionia.
As
weeks
passed
Chancellor
Malek
Hawkmoon,
the
officer
charged
with
overseeing
the
Noxian
presence
in
Ionia,
returned
from
an
emergency
conference
in
Noxus.
Hawkmoon
gave
a
stunning
response
to
the
protests
across
Valoran,
stating
that
while
the
demands
on
the
side
of
Ionia
were
unlawful,
it
was
within
Noxus'
right
to
grant
Ionia
its
rematch
before
the
proper
term
had
elapsed.
Should
Ionia
desire
to
meet
Noxus
on
the
Fields
of
Justice
again
to
determine
the
fate
of
southern
provinces,
then
Noxus
would
accept
the
terms
of
a
rematch.
The
Convergence
of
Elders
called
an
assembly
immediately
following
Hawkmoon's
speech.
After
the
Elders'
meeting
had
ended,
Duchess
Karma
announced
Ionia's
acceptance
of
Noxus’
offer.
The
two
city-states
entered
negotiations
to
solidify
the
stakes
of
the
match.
It
was
ultimately
determined
that
if
Ionia
won,
Noxus
must
withdraw
its
forces
in
full,
and
immediately
halt
any
and
all
extraction
of
Ionian
resources.
However,
should
Noxus
prevail,
Ionia
must
completely
surrender
the
southern
provinces
to
the
nation
of
Noxus,
and
furnish
one
Noxian
designee
with
a
seat
amongst
the
Ionian
Elders.
This
would
give
Noxus
a
voice
and
ear
inside
the
government
of
Ionia.
The
League
proceeded
to
approve
ten
champions
for
each
side.
These
champions
would
later
meet
in
a
single
battle
to
determine
the
fate
of
Ionia.

Miss

first

of
the
battle.
The
Ionia
versus
Noxus
Rematch
ended
in
a
decisive
victory
for
Ionia
over
Noxus,
allowing
the
Ionians
to
reclaim
their
southern
provinces.
Noxian
forces
began
withdrawing
from
those
regions
as
the
citizens
of
Galrin,
Navori,
and
Shon-Xan
erupted
in
celebration
prior
to
their
occupiers
vacating
completely.
The
regions
had
been
cut
off
from
the
rest
of
Ionia
for
seven
years
and
Ionians
from
all
over
the
island
descended
upon
the
regions
to
share
food,
supplies,
and
support.
Tearful
reunions
between
long-separated
families
became
a
common
sight
throughout
Ionia.
Many
citizens
gathered
in
droves
at
the
Lotus
Gardens.
They
anxiously
awaited
the
fate
of
Lee
Sin,
the
burning
monk
from
the
Shojin
Monastery,
who
incited
the
protest
by
setting
himself
aflame.
It
was
only
when
the
monk
was
greeted
by
his
sister
from
the
liberated
province
of
Galrin
that
he
allowed
the
flame
to
be
extinguished.
His
brethren
then
hastened
the
monk’s
blistered
body
swiftly
back
to
the
monastery
for
treatment.
The
invasion,
occupation,
protest,
and
finally
liberation
in
this
long
chapter
of
Ionia’s
history
had
at
last
drawn
to
a
close.
The
Festival
of
Fire
Shen
and
Akali
performing
as
guests
of
honor.
Ionians
from
every
province
gathered
beneath
the
flowered
branches
of
the
Great
Tree
in
the
Serene
Gardens
yesterday
for
the
city-state’s
annual
Festival
of
Fire.
An
early
summer
tradition,
this
festival
was
a
symbol
of
Ionian
culture,
celebrating
the
cleansing
and
rebirth
of
the
spirit.
Festivities
began
in
the
early
morning
as
citizens
poured
into
the
Serene
Gardens.
Vendors
set
up
shop
along
the
garden’s
edges,
offering
wares
of
traditional
Ionian
food,
garb,
and
antique
weaponry.
Citizens
mingled
in
the
shade
of
the
Great
Tree
and
wrote
their
woes
and
worries
on
scrolls
to
be
hung
from
the
Tree’s
branches.
During
the
night,
Ionian
citizens
were
treated
to
various
musical
and
theatric
performances
pertaining
to
Ionian
history
or
legend.
The
headlining
performance
featured
League
Champions
Shen,
the
Eye
of
Twilight
,
and
Akali,
the
Fist
of
Shadow
,
who
performed
The
Tale
of
Reina,
a
legend
in
which
an
ancient
Ionian
warrior
is
hunted
by
an
evil
spirit.
Akali
took
the
part
of
Reina
herself,
dressed
in
formal
Ionian
red
and
white
battle
garb,
and
Shen
played
the
spirit
that
plagued
her,
adorned
with
a
fearsome
mask.
As
the
legend
goes,
Reina
fled
the
spirit
for
years,
yet
it
always
found
and
tormented
her.
Finally,
Reina
donned
her
own
mask
to
confront
the
spirit,
but
when
she
turned
to
face
it,
it
never
came
again,
frightened
away
by
her
strength.
When
the
sun
rose
in
the
morning
and
the
Tree
had
become
almost
fully
concealed
behind
scrolls,
an
Ionian
summoner
lit
them
briefly
aflame.
As
the
magic
dissipated,
the
sun
shone
brilliantly
through
the
branches
of
the
Great
Tree.
Master
Hana,
an
Ionian
adjudicator,
stated
that
this
was
the
festival's
greatest
lesson:
out
of
any
darkness
comes
the
grandest
of
light.
The
Celestial
Fortress
Syndra's
Fortress
During
her
training,
Syndra,
the
Dark
Sovereign
discovered
that
her
magic
had
stopped
evolving.
She
went
to
her
master
to
demand
an
answer
for
this.
He
said
that
he
sealed
her
magic
in
hopes
that
she
would
learn
restraint
and
control.
Enraged,
she
assaulted
him
and
demanded
that
he
lift
the
seal.
Her
master
threatened
her
that
if
she
does
not
learn,
he
would
be
forced
to
strip
her
of
her
magic
completely.
Syndra
lifted
her
master
instead
and
smashed
him
to
the
wall
killing
him
and
ultimately
releasing
her
from
the
seal.
She
refused
to
return
to
her
village
and
so
she
turned
the
temple
into
her
fortress
and
lifted
it
into
the
sky.
She
now
plots
her
revenge
against
the
Elders
of
Ionia.
Eternity's
End
Soraka
before
falling
from
grace
The
immortal
Starchild,
Soraka
,
was
visited
in
her
hidden
grove
by
a
man
named
Warwick
and
in
his
hands,
the
body
of
his
late
wife.
Warwick
begged
her
to
restore
his
wife
but
her
powers
were
not
strong
enough
to
raise
the
dead.
Upon
hearing
this
Warwick
swore
to
find
the
fiends
that
murdered
his
wife.
Soraka
as
a
mortal
Warwick
came
to
the
grove
regularly,
eventually
establishing
a
friendly
relationship
with
Soraka.
One
day,
Warwick
found
out
who
killed
his
wife
and
he
wanted
vengeance.
Soraka
pleaded
against
the
idea
of
revenge,
but
Warwick
ignored
her
pleas.
Soraka
followed
him
to
try
and
keep
him
out
of
harms
way
despite
the
warnings
of
the
stars.
She
entered
the
mortal
realm
for
the
first
time
and
ran
after
him.
When
she
found
him,
Warwick
was
being
attacked
and
she
tried
to
heal
his
wounds
but
to
no
avail.
She
was
forced
to
use
her
powers
to
attack
and
immediately
became
mortal.
When
she
came
to
his
side,
Warwick
stabbed
her,
but
she
sent
him
away
with
powerful
magic
and
she
tended
to
her
wound.
Without
immortality
and
the
star's
guidance
gone,
she
now
lives
among
the
mortals
and
seeks
to
bring
an
end
to
the
Runeterra's
suffering.
The
Kinkou
Order
falls
The
Fall
of
the
Kinkou
Order
One
day,
Zed
looked
at
his
followers
and
saw
that
his
students
were
now
an
army.
He
led
them
back
to
the
temple
to
claim
his
prize.
At
the
gates,
he
was
surprised
to
find
the
old
master
waiting,
receiving
Zed
and
his
disciples
as
if
they
were
welcome
guests.
The
old
man
laid
his
sword
at
Zed's
feet,
declaring
that
he
had
failed
Zed
as
his
master.
By
banishing
his
former
student,
the
master
had
doomed
Zed
to
the
shadows,
instead
of
leading
him
to
the
balanced
path.
The
old
man
implored
Zed
to
enter
the
temple,
destroy
the
box,
and
lead
his
followers
to
balance.
The
dark
ninja
followed
the
master
inside.
Moments
later,
the
assembled
ninjas
heard
Zed
cry
out
in
pain.
Mysteriously,
he
emerged
unscathed,
and
threw
the
severed
head
of
the
master
at
Shen's
feet.
Screaming
in
rage,
Zed
commanded
his
followers
to
slaughter
the
master's
students
and
seize
the
box.
That
day,
the
old
ninja
order
fell.
Though
many
students
died,
some
escaped
thanks
to
Shen's
heroic
efforts.
Now
the
temple
is
a
dark
training
ground
for
the
Order
of
the
Shadow.
Zed
rules
as
the
Order's
master,
and
his
edict
is
simple:
perfect
one's
technique,
and
kill
all
ninjas
who
refuse
to
embrace
the
shadows.
An
Ancient
Mystery
In
Runeterra
An
Ancient
Mystery
In
Runeterra
An
Ionian
woodblock
with
a
carved
image
of
the
figure.
Is
it
stained
with
ink
or
blood?
This
Ionian
woodblock
was
carved
long
before
the
war
with
Noxus.
They're
rare
nowadays,
but
they're
always
more
or
less
the
same.
They
all
depict
things
of
beauty:
landscapes,
monks
in
meditation,
the
stars
and
the
night
sky,
all
of
that
"enlightenment"
stuff
they're
always
on
about.
All
of
them...
except
this
one.
I've
never
seen
anything
like
it.
It's
that
same
dark
figure
with
that
same
blade
-
and
the
worst
thing
-
I
don't
think
those
red
stains
are
ink...
