Elixir
of
Brilliance
is
a
consumable
item
in
League
of
Legends
.
[1]
Strategy
It
is
best
used
by
casters
or
other
champions
that
scale
with
ability
power
,
but
the
cooldown
reduction
is
useful
on
every
champion.
This
is
a
great
item
for
manaless
champions
that
lack
the
Crest
of
the
Ancient
Golem
and
need
cooldown
reduction.
Using
Elixir
of
Brilliance
during
the
mid
and
late
game
is
a
good
way
to
reach
the
40%
cooldown
reduction
cap
without
having
to
buy
extra
items.
Elixirs
are
often
bought
towards
the
end
of
long
games
when
builds
are
all
completed
and
the
extra
gold
continues
to
accumulate.
They
can
also
be
bought
mid
game
to
give
a
temporary
stat
advantage
during
ganks
and
teamfights,
or
even
at
level
one.
Notes
Consuming
this
item
along
with
Elixir
of
Fortitude
will
cause
the
colored
auras
to
alternate
from
blue
and
red.
Elixirs
are
automatically
applied
when
purchased
if
there
are
already
6
items
in
the
inventory.
Trivia
The
Piece
of
Blue
Candy
was
a
seasonal
item
that
replaced
the
Elixir
of
Brilliance
during
the
Harrowing
celebration.
It
was
the
same
item
with
a
different
name
and
picture.
The
Blue
Lasi
Kettle
was
another
seasonal
item
that
replaced
the
Elixir
of
Brilliance
during
the
Lunar
Revel
celebration.
The
Sagely
Spores
was
yet
another
seasonal
item
that
replaced
the
Elixir
of
Brilliance
during
the
Great
Hunt
.
