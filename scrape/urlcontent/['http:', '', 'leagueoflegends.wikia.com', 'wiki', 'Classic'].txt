Gameplay
On
both
Classic
maps,
the
primary
goal
is
to
destroy
the
enemy
Nexus
.
Defending
each
Nexus
are
several
turrets
and
inhibitors
;
each
structure
must
be
destroyed
in
sequence
(one
cannot
skip
straight
to
the
Nexus).
There
are
many
ways
to
destroy
turrets:
making
use
of
the
automatic
minions
to
take
the
brunt
of
the
turret's
fire
or
focusing
it
with
several
teamates
while
a
tank
draws
aggro
are
a
few
of
the
many
methods
of
destroying
turrets
while
minimizing
casualties.
After
the
turrets
have
been
destroyed,
the
inhibitors
defend
the
Nexus.
They
do
not
attack
but
are
a
vital
part
of
winning.
Destroying
them
will
allow
their
respective
lane
to
spawn
super
minions,
powerful
beings
that
can
crush
ordinary
minions
with
ease.
Features
Summoner's
Rift
-
A
Field
that
draws
inspiration
from
the
Defense
of
the
Ancients:
Allstars
(often
shortened
to
DotA)
version
of
the
map,
with
several
tweaked
features
and
mechanics.
The
game
consists
of
five
summoners
on
each
team,
who
are
pitted
against
each
other
in
an
attempt
to
destroy
the
enemy
Nexus
and
win.
The
general
time
it
takes
to
complete
a
game
ranges
from
35-50
minutes.
Summoner's
Rift
Features
Three
lanes
to
fight
your
way
to
the
enemy
base
An
overview
of
Summoner's
Rift.
.
A
jungle
populated
by
neutral
monsters
of
varying
degrees
of
toughness,
the
toughest
of
which
provide
buffs
and/or
gold
for
your
whole
team.
Powerful
turrets
defend
key
areas
on
the
map.
You
must
confront
these
in
addition
to
your
enemies
if
you
are
to
make
headway
toward
victory.
A
map
dividing
river
that
lies
in
neutral
territory,
allowing
for
quick
travel
between
lanes.
Two
bases
at
opposite
corners
of
the
map,
populated
by
a
shop,
a
Nexus
,
two
turrets
to
defend
the
nexus,
and
inhibitors
that
suppress
the
other
team's
minions.
Noticable
differences
with
DotA
The
side
lanes
do
not
have
varying
lengths:
they
are
uniform
in
length.
The
turret
placement
is
also
exactly
equal.
The
secret
shop
does
not
exist
in
Summoner's
Rift.
Leaving
will
not
grant
allies
control
of
your
champion
.
Roshan
(a
legendary
neutral
creep
from
DotA)
is
replaced
by
two
different
legendary
creeps
on
opposite
sides
of
the
map:
Dragon
and
Baron
Nashor
.
Removal
of
the
Deny
function.
Brush
scattered
around
the
map
-
small
pockets
of
instant
stealth
that
can
be
used
for
hiding,
running
and
confusing
opponents.
Dying
in
Summoner's
Rift
does
not
tax
gold
or
experience.
The
many
shops
have
become
merged
into
one,
with
a
simple
layout
and
recommended
items
for
beginners.
Minions
cannot
be
pulled
very
far
from
their
lane:
After
a
short
distance,
they
return
to
their
lane.
You
cannot
buyback
(instant
revival
at
the
cost
of
gold).
Additional
buildings
removed:
only
the
turrets,
Nexus,
and
inhibitors
(or
barracks)
remain.
Twisted
Treeline
Map
Twisted
Treeline
The
Twisted
Treeline
is
a
Field
of
Justice
that
is
geared
towards
quicker
gameplay
as
opposed
to
that
of
Summoner's
Rift.
The
general
time
for
games
on
this
map
is
20-35
minutes.
The
map
features
a
smaller
field,
with
only
two
lanes
and
one
legendary
creep
known
as
Vilemaw
.
Features
Two
lanes
to
fight
your
way
to
the
enemy
base.
