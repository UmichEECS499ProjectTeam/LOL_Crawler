How
to
Get
On
Twisted
Treeline
,
by
slaying
Vilemaw
.
Unlike
other
monster
buffs,
this
buff
is
not
transferable:
the
buff
is
lost
when
a
champion
carrying
it
is
killed.
This
is
similar
to
the
Exalted
with
Baron
Nashor
buff.
Patch
history
V1.0.0.150
Ebonmaw
has
been
removed.
Vilemaw
will
now
grant
the
buff.
Will
now
grant
bonus
health
and
mana
regeneration,
attack
speed,
and
cooldown
reduction.
V1.0.0.101
:
Ebonmaw
no
longer
grants
the
Crest
of
Crushing
Wrath
buff
to
dead
allied
champions.
Now
has
a
proper
cooldown
timer.
V1.0.0.52
:
Adjusted
to
increase
damage
by
1%
per
level.

Effects

Crushing
Wrath
(old)
–
Increases
the
damage
dealt
by
champions
by
a
1%

at
most
increase
the
damage
output
by
18%.
Both
basic
attacks
and
skills
damage
were
amplified
by
this
buff.
