Old
Ward
Model
A
ward
is
an
item
that
reveals
the
Fog
of
War
once
placed.
It
is
visible
for
a
short
time
but
becomes
stealthed
and
has
a
limited
duration
of
3
minutes.
A
ward
has
the
fixed
3
units
of
health
and
any
attack
on
it
only
reduces
1
unit
per
hit
regardless.
Any
damage
enhancing
effect
(e.g.
Nami's
Tidecaller's
Blessing
,
passive
of
Thresh's
Flay
,
passive
of
Statikk
Shiv
or
any
Spellblade
passive)
will
not
be
applied
or
consumed
while
attacking
the
ward.
Wards
would
visibly
burn
when
attacked
by
a
champion
with
Blessing
of
the
Lizard
Elder
,
but
no
additional
damage
will
be
dealt.
In
patch
V3.12
Sight
and
Vision
Wards
received
a
model
and
texture
update.
In
patch
V3.14
Sight
and
Vision
Wards
were
changed
totally,
Sight
Ward
was
renamed
Stealth
Ward
and
now
is
limited
to
3
placed
for
player
and
Vision
Wards
now
are
visibles
but
have
5
units
of
health.

Skins
Ward
skins
first

2012
Harrowing
seasonal
event,
and
the
five
new
ward
skins
were
put
on
sale
for

only
and
not
permanent.
Some
of
the
wards
were
purchasable
for
a
small
amount
of
while
others
were
made
obtainable
with
.
Riot
was
just
introducing
the
new
idea
of
ward
skins
and
listened
intently
to
the
feedback
(that
proved
to
be
negative)
for
future
ward
skins.

Announcement
made
by
NeeksNaman
:
[1]
We're
excited
to
announce
ward
skins,
a
new
customization
option
that
allows
you
to
change
the
appearance
of
your
Sight
and
Vision
Wards
on
the
Fields
of
Justice.
In
keeping
with
the
season,
these
ward
skins
are
inspired
by
the
haunting
guise
of
the
Shadow
Isles.
Activating
a
ward
skin
will
transform
your
wards
into
ghosts,
spooky
trees,
spiders,
creepy
stone
statues,
or
pumpkin-headed
bats
with
their
own
unique
visual
effects,
sounds,
and
animations.
Here's
how
they
work.
When
you
purchase
a
specific
ward
skin
from
the
Wards
tab
of
the
League
of
Legends
Store,
it
gets
added
to
your
inventory
for
one
week.
You
can
activate
a
specific
ward
skin
to
change
the
appearance
of
your
wards
in
game.
You
can
keep
up
to
a
year's
worth
(52
weeks)
of
ward
skins
in
your
inventory
at
a
time,
so
don’t
hesitate
to
stock
up
if
you
have
a
favorite.
Ward
skins
function
the
same
as
a
regular
Sight
or
Vision
ward.
Here
are
the
first
five
ward
skins
available
to
unlock:
Deadfall
Ward
–
200
IP
Haunting
Ward
–

Ward
–

RP
Widow
Ward
–

Bat-O-Lantern
Ward
–

Free
Ward
Skins
After
receiving
the
negative
feedback
from
players
voicing
their
objection
against
having
to
spend
points
on
a
ward
skin
that
won't
be
permanent
on
their
account,
ward
skins
were
made
free
to
to
use
for
upcoming
events.
However,
they
were
only
available
for
use
during
the
following
seasonal
event
and
removed
once
they
were
over.

On

Riot
introduced
the
first
permanent
and
champion-
based
ward
skins.
Announcement
made
by
RiotWenceslaus
[2]
If
you've
been
hankering
for
some
new
ward
skins,
we've
got
some
good
news
for
you.
The
first
run
of
permanent,
non-seasonal
wards
is
now
hot
off
the
presses
into
the
League
of
Legends
store.
To
help
you
rep
a
trio
of
your
favorite
champs
wherever
you're
laning,
these
new
ward
skins
are
all
themed
after
members
of
the
League
of
Legends
lineup.
You'll
find
them
in
the
wards
tab
of
the
store
for
640
RP
once
the
new
patch
lands:
Lux
:
Light
the
way
with
some
wand-shaped
warding!
Soraka
:
Let
the
cosmos
guide
you
by
picking
up
Starchild
wards!
Draven
:
Fly
your
League
of
Draven
colors
proudly
with
the
official
ward
of
the
Glorious
Executioner!
If
you're
a
super-passionate
ward-enthusiast
or
just
like
a
little
variety
you
can
also
snag
all
three
as
a
bundle
for
1632
RP.
It's
a
good
day
to
buy
a
Sight
Stone,
summoners.
Happy
warding,
and
we'll
see
you
on
the
Fields
of
Justice.
Harrowing
2013
For
the
Harrowing
event
of
2013,
the
five
holiday
ward
skins
from
the
previous
year
saw
their
return
to
the
store.
This
time
they
were
free
to
use
during
the
event
and
purchasable
for
640
to
unlock
them
permanently.

Victorious
Ward
Skin

a
close
on
November
12,
2013,
Riot
awarded
summoners
who
achieved
a
ranking
of
