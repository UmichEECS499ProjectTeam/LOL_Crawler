A

Turret
in
bot
lane
A
Turret
,
also
called
a
Tower
,
is
a
heavy
fortification
that
blocks
the
enemy's
minion
waves
and
champions'
path
to
the
Nexus
.
In
order
for
a
Champion
to
push
forward
and
continue
its
assault
into
the
enemies’
territory,
the
champion
must
destroy
these
turrets.
Charging
minions
will
not
be
able
to
pass
any
further
up
a
lane
until
the
turret
closest
to
them
is
destroyed.
Turrets
do
heavy
damage
to
enemy
units.
Summoner's
Rift
has
11
turrets
per
team.

Attack
Prioritization
Turrets
will
continue
to
attack
their
current
target
until
the
target
dies,
leaves
attack
range,
or
becomes
untargetable
due
to
abilities
or
items.
A
turret
will
attack
an
enemy
champion
only
if
that
champion
deals
damage
to
an
allied
champion.
The
ally
must
also
be
within
range
of
the
same
turret
in
order
for
it
to
attack
the
enemy.
Damage
dealt
can
come
from
any
source
(pet,
aura,
item,
etc.)
in
order
for
a
champion
to
be
targeted.
Additionally,
turrets
will
target
an
enemy
champion
if
no
other
valid
target
is
within
range.
Turrets
will
not
attack
an
enemy
champion
who
uses
a
spell
that
deals
no
damage
(such
as
Karthus's
Wall
of
Pain
).
A
spell
or
attack
that
is
blocked
(by
a
spell
shield
or
ability
effect)
and
deals
no
damage
will
still
draw
turret
aggro.
When
the
current
target
is
lost
for
whatever
reason,
the
turret
will
select
a
new
target—whichever
of
the
following,
in
order,
is
found
in
range
first:
The
closest
targetable
Trap
(i.e.
Rampant
Growth
).
The
closest
enemy
Pet
(i.e.
Mirror
Image
,
Hallucinate
,
Summon:
Tibbers
,
Children
of
the
Grave
,
Summon
Voidling
,
H-28G
Evolution
Turret
,
Decoy
,
Spider
Swarm
,
or
Omen
of
Death
).
The
closest
enemy
Siege
Minion
or
Super
Minion.
The
closest
enemy
Melee
Minion.
The
closest
enemy
Caster
Minion.
The
closest
enemy
Champion.
Turret
healing
and
invulnerability
Inhibitor
turrets
have
15
Health
Regeneration
per
5
seconds.
The
Nexus
Turrets
also
have
natural
Health
Regeneration.
However,
if
inhibitors
have
been
destroyed
this
far,
it
would
be
difficult
to
"turtle"
the
match
by
turret-hugging.
Inner
turrets
are
invulnerable
and
untargetable
until
the
corresponding
Outer
turrets
are
destroyed.
Likewise,
Inhibitor
turrets
are
invulnerable
and
untargetable
until
the
corrsponding
Inner
turrets
are
destroyed,
and
Nexus
turrets
are
invulnerable
and
untargetable
unless
at
least
one
inhibitor
is
destroyed.
Turret
Damage
Turrets
deal
70%
damage
to
siege
minions
and
super
minions
[1]
.
Turrets
first
attacks
on
champions
deal
105%
damage
[2]
.
The
Nexus
Obelisk
deals
a
flat
1000
damage
every
0.5
seconds,
ignoring
all
damage
reduction
and
resistance.
Damage
from
the
other
turrets
is
mitigated
by
your
armor
-
minus
the
Armor
penetration
due
to
the
Penetrating
Bullets
passive.
Passives
described
by
the
Turret's
Inventory
items
Turrets
have
an
item
inventory
that
can
be
seen
by
clicking
on
them.
Each
item
in
the
inventory
explains
a
specific
turret
mechanic.
Reinforced

:
Gains
150
Armor
and

resistance
when
no
enemy
minions
are
in
range
for
attack.
This
makes
backdooring
less
effective
than
conventional
pushing.
It
is
not
tested
whether
traps
(Shaco's
Jack
in
the
box),
pets
(Annie's
Tibbers
or
Yorick's
ghouls)
and
monsters
(a
Golem
brought
around
by
Syndra's
Force
of
Will)
deactivate
this
passive
too.

-
Warming
Up
:
Turrets
gain
25%
damage
each
time
they
strike
a
champion
(Max
75%
bonus
damage).
It
should
be
noted
that
this
passive
is
not
champion-specific,
meaning
it
keeps
stacking
even
when
switching
between
champions.
In
other
words,
it
resets
only
when
attacking
a
non-champion
(pet,
minion
or
monster).
Unique
passive
-
Heated
Up
:
After
the
turret
is
fully
heated,
consecutive
attacks
against
the
same
champion
deal
25%
additional
damage
(Max
50%
bonus
damage).
Both
Warming
Up
and
Heated
Up
bring
a
total
of
105%
damage
on
the
first
hit,
then
125%,
150%,
175%,
200%,
and
up
to
a
maximum
of
225%
on
the
sixth
hit
and
beyond.
If
the
turret
attacks
another
champion,
only
Heated
Up
stacks
will
be
reset,
and
the
damage
will
stay
at
175%.
If
a
non-champion
(pet,
minion,
monster,
trap...)
is
hit,
both
passives
reset
and
damage
returns
to
105%.

Damaging
Turrets
Damage
to
a
turret
is
based
on
your
base
attack
damage
plus
the
higher
of
your
bonus
attack
damage
or
40%
of
your
ability
power
[4]
.
It
is
not
affected
by
any
kind
of
armor
or
magic
penetration
[5]
[6]
.
Critical
strikes
will
register
against
turrets.
However,
they
are
not
affected
by
them,
and
no
bonus
damage
will
be
incurred.
Top
and
middle
lane
outer
turrets
have
20
damage
reduction
from
champion
basic
attacks
since
V4.1
.
The
phrasing
in
the
patch
notes
makes
it
ambiguous
whether
this
is
permanent
or
happens
only
during
the
first
8
minutes
of
the
game;
feel
free
to
test
and
update.
Rewards
for
destruction
Last-hitting
a
turret
does
not
grant
extra
gold
to
the
champion.
Exceptions:
Twisted
Fate's
Loaded
Dice
grants
him
from
1
to
6
gold
to
when
he
last-hits
a
turret.
Ashe's
Hawkshot
and
Avarice
Blade
also
apply.
Cho'Gath's
Carnivore
heals
and
restore
mana
upon
last-hitting
a
turret.

Notes
The
texture
and
model
of
a
turret
in
development.
Turrets
count
as
terrain.
Any
abilities
that
interact
with
terrain
can
trigger
their
effects
using
them,
namely
the
stuns
from
Poppy's
Heroic
Charge
and
Vayne's
Condemn
.
Nautilus's
Dredge
Line
will
also
drag
him
to
turrets.
Towers
can
be
shielded
by
Janna's
Eye
Of
The
Storm
.
Aura
effects
do
not
affect
turrets.
If
a
turret
is
destroyed
while
a
shot
is
in
mid-flight,
that
shot
would
not
deal
any
damage.
The
3D
models
and
icons
of
the
Inner,
Inhibitor
and
Nexus
turrets
are
different.
Inner
and
Outer
turrets
have
the
same
model
and
icons.
