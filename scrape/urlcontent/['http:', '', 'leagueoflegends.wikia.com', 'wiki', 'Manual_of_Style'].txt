This
page
documents
an
official
League
of
Legends
Wiki
policy.
It
is
a
widely
accepted
standard
that
should
normally
be
followed
by
all
editors.
This
Manual
of
Style
outlines
a
standard
of
clean,
consistent
formatting
for
articles
in
League
of
Legends
Wiki.
The
formatting
described
here
is
a
guideline
and
can
be
overridden
where
circumstances
warrant
it.
These
guidelines
will
never
be
unerringly
perfect
for
every
situation.
However,
please
try
your
best
to
keep
to
the
advice
outlined
in
this
article
so
others
may
use
your
edits
as
an
example
when
creating
and
editing
their
own
articles.
These
guidelines
are
a
summary
of
the
most
important
guidelines
for
the
League
of
Legends
Wiki,
but
a
more
expansive
set
of
guidelines
can
be
found
on
Wikipedia
at

Grammar
and
punctuation
When
writing
articles
it
is
important
to
follow
these
rules
of
the
english
language:
Don't
use
netspeak
or
any
similar
slang.
We
are
compiling
a
professional
resource
for
League
of
Legends
fans.
Keep
your
writing
around
a
6th
Grade
reading
level.
You
don't
need
to
fill
it
with
big
words
just
to
make
it
sound
smarter,
especially
if
you're
not
certain
how
the
word
should
be
used.
Vary
your
words
.
When
writing,
try
to
vary
the
words
you
use
and
the
length
of
your
sentences.
It
makes
things
sound
more
interesting.
Capitalize
words
when
appropriate.
(
see
below
)
Use
correct
punctuation.
This
includes
commas
,
periods
,
quotation
marks
,
and
apostrophes
.
(
see
below
)
Know
the
difference
between
homophones
:
there,
their,
and
they're;
here
and
hear;
it's
and
its;
who's
and
whose.
Capitalization
For
a
full
list
visit
Capital
Community
College's
Guide
to
Grammar
and
Writing
Capitalize
the
first
word
of
every
sentence.
(eg.
Annie
uses
mainly
her
spells,
instead
of
normal
physical
attacks.
)
Capitalize
proper
nouns.
(eg.
Steve
Mescon
)
Capitalize
the
first
and
important
words
in
a
title.
(eg.
"
League
of
Legends
"
,
"Shaco
the
Demon
Jester"
)
Do
not
capitalize
titles
like
"champion",
"summoner"
or
similar
except
when
used
as
a
proper
name.
[1]
Capitalize
the
names
of
champions,
spells,
items,
runes,
and
masteries
(e.g.
Annie,
Alpha
Strike,
Flash,
Cloth
Armor,
Lesser
Mark
of
Desolation,
Strength
of
Spirit).
Don't
capitalize
champion
statistics
(e.g.
armor,
magic
resistance,
magic
penetration,
lifesteal,
tenacity).
Acronyms
are
still
capitalized,
of
course
(e.g.
MR,
AD).
Punctuation
In
addition
to
basic
punctuation,
it
is
important
to
know
how
to
punctuate
titles.
Titles
are
always
either
in
italics
or
inside
quotation
marks.
Italics
Italics
are
used
for
large
works
like
games,
movies,
comics
and
books.
Example:
League
of
Legends
To
use
italics
on
Wikia
place
two
single
quote
marks
before
and
after
the
title:
''League
of
Legends''
These
are
single
quotes
('),
not
double
quotes
(").
Alternately,
highlight
the
title
you
want
to
put
in
italics
with
your
mouse
and
click
the
"
I
"
button
in
the
toolbar
above
the
edit
box
(in
between
the
B
for
bolding
and
AB
for
the
Internal
link).
Links
To
link
to
another
article
inside
League
of
Legends
Wiki,
you
must
put
[[
]]
around
it.
To
link
an
article
to
an
external
site
put
the
link
between
[
].
Linking
an
article
to
Wikipedia
or
Wikia
is
somewhat
different.
For
Wikipedia
use
{{w|
}}
and
put
the
link
inside,
for
other
Wikia
sites
-
{{wikia|name
of
the
wikia|link
after
/wiki/}}.
If
an
article
does
not
exist
by
that
name,
the
link
will
show
up
as
dark
red,
like
this
.
External
links
will
show
up
as
blue.
You
only
need
to
link
to
another
page
once
in
any
given
article.
Most
of
the
time
this
is
the
first
time
that
article's
title
comes
up,
but
there
are
some
exceptions
to
this.
Examples:
[[Ashe]]
[[Ashe
the
Frost
Archer]]
[http://na.leagueoflegends.com
The
official
LoL
site]
{{w|League
of
Legends|the
Wikipedia
entry
for
the
game}}
{{wikia|dota|Steve_Feak-"Guinsoo"|Guinsoo}}
Champion
articles
In
the
Story
section
of
a
Champion
article,
link
to
an
article
the
first
time
it
appears
even
if
it's
been
linked
to
previously.
In
the
Trivia
section,
only
information
which
is
relevant
to
the
article,
has
a
cited
source
or
reference
(such
as
a
link
to
a
wikipedia
article),
and
is
not
common
knowledge
should
be
included.
Links
to
champion
articles
When
referencing
a
champion,
a
majority
of
the
time
they
can
be
referred
to
by
just
their
name
leaving
the
title
away,
e.g.,
Twisted
Fate
instead
of
Twisted
Fate
the
Card
Master.
To
assist
with
creating
links
inside
pages,
redirects
have
been
established
for
each
champion
that
includes
their
title.
Examples:
[[Master
Yi]]
works
just
the
same
as
[[Master
Yi
the
Wuju
Bladesman]]
and
[[Master
Yi
the
Wuju
Bladesman|Master
Yi]]
If
it
is
necessary
to
have
the
link
display
something
other
than
the
title
of
the
link,
that
information
should
be
placed
after
the
pipe
(the
vertical
bar)
inside
the
link:
[[Summoner's
Rift|the
first
map]]
,
which
appears
as
the
first
map
.
For
ease
of
use
and
to
give
the
wiki
a
more
colorful
appearance,
a
Champion
Icon
template
has
been
made
to
make
links
to
champions
stand
out.
Example:
{{ci|Miss
Fortune}}
results
in
Miss
Fortune
.
If
you
need
to
add
a
custom
link
text,
add
it
as
a
next
parameter
after
champion
official
name:
{{ci|Miss
Fortune|Miss
Fortune
the
Bounty
Hunter}}
results
in
Miss
Fortune
the
Bounty
Hunter
.
Links
to
item
articles
Similar
to
those
for
champions,
an
Item
Icon
template
has
been
created
in
order
to
provide
graphic
representation
of
the
item
icon
before
the
link.
Example:
{{ii|Rod
of
Ages}}
results
in
Rod
of
Ages
.
Links
to
champion
abilities
In
the
same
style,
there
is
an
Ability
Icon
Template
that
allows
direct
linking
to
a
champion's
page
and
the
section
for
a
specific
ability,
and
displays
its
icon.
There
is
also
a
template
to
only
display
the
ability;
don't
forget
to
add
the
champion's
name,
though.
Example:
{{cai|Starcall|Soraka}}
results
in
Soraka's
Starcall
{{ai|Miasma|Cassiopeia}}
results
in
Miasma
Articles
Naming
articles
Note
that
Wikia
handles
capitalized
words
differently
than
lowercase
words.
Entering
them
into
search
will
bring
up
two
different
articles.
Article
names
should
be
in
singular
form,
not
plural.
The
initial
letter
of
a
title
is
capitalized.
Otherwise,
capital
letters
are
used
only
where
they
would
be
used
in
a
normal
sentence.
Do
not
use
a
,
an
,
or
the
as
the
first
word,
unless
by
convention
it
is
an
inseparable
part
of
a
name.
The
final
visible
character
of
a
title
should
not
be
a
punctuation
mark.
Champions
There
are
a
few
simple
rules
to
follow
when
naming
a
character
article.
Articles
are
named
using
the
standard
name
of
a
champion
as
seen
in
champion
select,
e.g.
Shaco
,
Lux
,
Lee
Sin
.
If
a
champion's
name
is
not
known
from
a
official
source,
then
it
is
all
right
to
use
the
champion's
title,
e.g.
The
Plant
King
.
You
may
want
to
create
redirects
for
common
address
of
a
character.
For
example:
Redirect
Cardmaster
to
Twisted
Fate
Redirect
Guinsoo
to
Steve
Feak
Administrators
may
move
articles
without
consultation
if
they
do
not
conform
to
the
Character
Naming
Policy.
Items
Item
articles
are
named
for
the
items
precisely
as
they
are
presented
in-game.
Each
item
in
the
shop
has
the
title
and
it
must
be
titled
exactly
as
written.
This
includes
capitalization
and
punctuation,
but
does
not
include
the
quotation
marks
around
the
title.
Please
note
that
it
may
be
appropriate
to
create
redirects
from
one
or
two
common
misspellings
or
mis-capitalizations
of
titles
to
make
users'
searches
easier.
Administrators
may
move
articles
without
consultation
when
they
don't
conform
to
the
Episode
Naming
Policy.
Summoner
spells
and
masteries
Summoner
spell
and
mastery
articles
are
named
precisely
as
their
in-game
counterparts.
Each
spell
or
mastery
has
a
title
and
so
it
must
be
titled
exactly
as
it
is
written
by
Riot.
Section
headers
All
of
the
guidelines
for
article
titles
above
applies
to
section
headings
as
well.
Headings
provide
an
overview
in
the
table
of
contents
and
allow
readers
to
navigate
through
the
text
more
easily.
Section
and
subsection
headings
should
preferably
be
unique
within
a
page;
otherwise,
after
editing,
the
display
can
arrive
at
the
wrong
section
(see
also
below)
and
the
automatic
edit
summary
can
be
ambiguous.
Headings
should
be
descriptive
and
in
a
consistent
order
Headings
should
not
normally
contain
links,
especially
where
only
part
of
a
heading
is
linked.
Headings
should
not
explicitly
refer
to
the
subject
of
the
article,
or
to
higher-level
headings,
unless
doing
so
is
shorter
or
clearer.
The
nesting
hierarchy
for
headings
is
as
follows:
the
automatically
generated
top-level
heading
of
a
page
is
H1,
which
gives
the
article
title;
primary
headings
are
then
==H2==,
===H3===,
====H4====,
and
so
on
until
the
lowest-level
heading
======H6======.
headings
should
be
nested
sequentially,
neither
using
random
heading
levels
(e.g.
selected
for
emphasis,
which
is
not
the
purpose
of
headings),
nor
skipping
parts
of
the
sequence.
Spaces
between
the
==
and
the
heading
text
are
optional
(==H2==
is
equivalent
to
==
H2
==).
These
extra
spaces
will
not
affect
the
way
the
heading
is
displayed
to
readers.
Include
one
blank
line
above
the
heading
for
readability
in
the
edit
window.
Headings
should
be
nested
sequentially,
starting
with
level
2
(
==
),
then
level
3
(
===
)
and
so
on
(level
1
is
not
used,
as
this
is
the
auto-generated
page
title),

Formatting
guidelines
The
Articles
on
League
of
Legends
Wiki
that
constitute
a
set
of
types
(Champions,
Items,
Minions,
etc.)
have
usually
a
preset
"template"
that
are
very
useful
in
case
you
don't
know
how
to
start
or
need
guidelines
on
how
certain
information
needs
to
be
presented.
The
following
pages
give
you
an
example
of
what
the
page
should
look
like
overall
as
well
as
provide
a
set
of
guidelines
and
rules
to
be
used
for
that
particular
type
of
article.

General
information
The
following
guidelines
are
currently
an
unwritten
rule
throughout
the
wiki,
certain
things
are
done
certain
ways
on
numerous
pages,
and
numerous
users
have
come
to
agree
upon
using
a
certain
way
to
present
same
information
over
and
over.
So,
this
section
will
finally
document
these
guidelines.
For
champion
abilities
that
gain
bonus
damage
from
attack
damage,
the
conversion
factor
is
typically
written
as
percentage.
Example:
Spinning
Slash
:
attack
damage
scaling
modified
to
100%
of
bonus
attack
damage
from
50%
of
total
attack
damage.
For
champion
abilities
that
gain
bonus
damage
from
ability
power,
the
conversion
factor
is
typically
written
as
a
decimal
fraction.
Example:
Spinning
Slash
:
ability
power
ratio
reduced
to
0.7
from
0.8.
Categories
Pages
are
not
placed
directly
into
every
possible
category,
only
into
the
most
specific
one
in
any
branch.
This
means
that
if
a
page
belongs
to
a
subcategory
of
C
(or
a
subcategory
of
a
subcategory
of
C,
and
so
on)
then
it
is
not
placed
directly
into
C.
Normally
a
new
article
will
fit
into
existing
categories
–
compare
articles
on
similar
topics
to
find
what
those
categories
are.
Editors
should
categorize
every
article
or
file
that
currently
has
no
category.
Particular
considerations
for
categorizing
articles:
Each
article
should
be
placed
in
all
of
the
most
specific
categories
to
which
it
logically
belongs.
Categorize
articles
by
characteristics
of
the
topic,
not
characteristics
of
the
article.
An
article
should
never
be
left
with
a
non-existent
(redlinked)
category
on
it.
Either
the
category
should
be
created,
or
else
the
link
should
be
removed
or
changed
to
a
category
that
does
exist.
By
convention,
category
declarations
are
placed
at
the
end
of
the
wikitext.
For
more
information
about
categories,
see
Wikipedia:Categories
.

Images
are
preferred
to
be
Right-alignment
to
left-alignment.
Although
this
is
allowed
when
other
objects
interfere
or
make
it
visually
unappealing.
Any
given
article
shouldn't
have
too
many
images.
If
there
are
too
many
images
in
the
article,
consider
making
a
gallery
with
a
level
two
heading
at
the
bottom
of
the
article.
Use
captions
to
explain
the
relevance
of
the
image
to
the
article.
Large
images
should
be
presented
in
an
article
using
a
thumbnail
that
is
of
appropriate
size.
Complete
sentences
in
captions
should
always
end
with
a
period.
If
the
caption
is
not
a
complete
sentence,
it
generally
should
not
have
a
period
at
the
end.
Captions
should
also
not
be
italicized.
Uploading
images
Please
name
your
files
descriptively
to
avoid
confusion.
Uploading
an
image
with
the
name
"0239235jgjgkdgdf.jpg"
will
be
deleted
or
moved
according
to
the
opinion
of
the
administrator.
Do
not
upload
images
we
already
have
.
If
you
plan
on
uploading
an
image,
look
around
the
League
of
Legends
Wiki
first
to
see
if
it
has
already
been
uploaded
by
someone
else.
Abilities,
Items,
Skins,
Champion
Squares
and
any
other
image
should
be
in
.jpg,
.gif
or
.png
format.
This
is
in
order
for
pages
to
load
faster.
There
are
strict
guidelines
on
how
to
name
those.
Abilities
should
have
the
64x64px
dimension,
Squares
(Infobox
Portraits)
should
have
the
120x120px.
Other
images
(renders,
in-game
screenshots,
etc.)
are
allowed
to
be
in
