Oktoberfest
Gragas
Comic

Trivia
Gragas
was
designed
by
Geeves
.
Gragas
is
voiced
by
J.S.
Gilbert,
Who
also
voices
Battlecast
Prime
Cho'Gath
,
Dr.
Mundo
,
Sion
and
Udyr
.
He
previously
held
the
title
of
the
"Cask
Master",
but
it
was
most
likely
changed
due
to
similarities
with
Twisted
Fate's
title,
the
"Card
Master".
Gragas
himself
is
possibly
based
off
of
"The
Miller"
from
The
Canterbury
Tales
by
Geoffrey
Chaucer
.
Gragas'
9,000
year
lease
for
the
Avarosa
Iceflow
Glacier
from
Ashe
and
Tryndamere
is
a
reference
to
Guinness,
who
have
a
similar
deal.
Oktoberfest
Gragas'
barrel
in
his
model
has
the
word
"Rengarbräu"
in
it
which
translates
as
Rengar-Brew.
Gragas
got
a
new
German
voice
in
2013.
There
is
a
barrel
of
wine
that
possibly
belongs
to
Gragas
in
the
Mac
Version
Launch
video.
Gragas
translates
from
Old
Norse
(
Grágás
)
to
Grey
Goose
,
which
is
a
popular
vodka
spirit.
With
the
reclassification
of
all
champions
in
v3.10
,
Gragas
became
the
only
melee
mage.
Interestingly,
prior
to
v3.10,
Gragas
was
classified
as
a
melee
fighter.
Quotes
Gragas'
quote
"Oh
yeah!"
is
likely
a
reference
to
the
Kool-Aid
Man,
as
they
are
both
large,
round
figures
who
carry
beverages
and
have
a
habit
of
bursting
through
walls.
His
quote
"Dodge
this!"
is
probably
a
reference
to
a
scene
in
The
Matrix
where
Trinity
says
the
same
thing
before
killing
an
agent.
His
joke
may
be
a
reference
to
Ted
Striker's
"drinking
problem"
in
the
movie
Airplane!,
as
his
"problem"
is
an
inability
to
guide
the
drink
safely
to
his
mouth.
Gragas
shares
a
quote
with
Nami
:
"Have
a
drink!"
Skins
The
spatula
in
the
background
of
Scuba
Gragas
artwork
most
likely
belongs
to
Urf
.
Hillbilly
Gragas
is
a
reference
to
the
"hillbilly"
stereotype.
Santa
Gragas
skin
is
a
reference
to
Santa
Claus
,
a
figure
in
Western
culture
who
represents
the
mythological
and
folkloric
aspects
of
Christmas
.
The
term
Esq.,
as
used
in
Gragas
Esq.
means
"esquire",
which
is
an
unofficial
title
of
respect,
having
no
precise
significance,
which
is
used
to
denote
a
high
but
indeterminate
social
status.
The
bottle
from
Gragas'
Esq.
skin
says
"Gragasse
brute".
However,
in
the
in-game
skin
art,
the
bottle
will
actually
say
"Responsibly",
possibly
a
reference
to
the
recurring
theme
of
"Drink
Responsibly"
at
the
end
of
most
alcoholic
beverage
commercials.
In
the
splash
art
for
Oktoberfest
Gragas
you
can
see
Gangplank
,
Olaf
,
and
Ashe
all
dressed
fitting
the
Octoberfest
Theme.
You
can
also
see
the
glove
of
Teemo
in
the
bottom
left
corner
holding
a
drink.
Relations
Gragas
brews
and
sells
his
own
brand
of
alcohol
known
as
"Graggy
Ice,"
and
has
made
a
business
deal
with
Singed
to
mass-produce
his
product
in
chemical
plants
based
in
Zaun
.
Singed
has
also
provided
some
of
the
necessary
hardware
for
Gragas'
brewery
expansion
plans
in
other
regions
as
part
of
the
deal.
[3]
[4]
He
made
a
deal
with
Queen
Ashe
and
King
Tryndamere
to
lease
the
Avarosa
Iceflow
from
Freljord
for
9,000
years
for
the
constant
water
supply
to
his
brewery
expansion
in
Freljord
that
is
constructed
entirely
of
ice.

Jax
is
Gragas
drinking
buddy.
