Hotfix
There
was
a
hotfix
for
double
cast
bugs:
We've
just
deployed
a
hotfix
to
resolve
the
Double
Cast
issues
that
some
champions
are
seeing.
You
should
not
be
able
to
double
cast
any
of
the
previously
affected
spells
as
of
right
now,
however
it
may
APPEAR
to
double
fire.
We
have
issued
a
small
client
side
patch
that
will
resolve
the
visual
discrepancy,
so
simply
logging
out
and
logging
back
in
should
resolve
that.
NOTE:
This
does
NOT
fix
the
Gragas
issue,
which
we
will
be
tackling
next
and
keep
you
updated
about.
