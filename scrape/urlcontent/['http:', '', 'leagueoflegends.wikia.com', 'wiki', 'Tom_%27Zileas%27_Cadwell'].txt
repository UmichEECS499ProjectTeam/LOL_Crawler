Prior
to
joining
Riot,
Tom
worked
at
Blizzard
as
a
Designer
on
World
of
Warcraft,
designing
much
of
the
core
talent
system
and
polishing
the
new
player
experience.
He
also
worked
on
the
Warcraft
III
The
Frozen
Throne,
heading
up
play
balance,
and
working
on
a
variety
of
other
systems.
Tom
holds
a
MBA
from
Kellogg
and
a
BS
in
Computer
Science
from
MIT.
We
thought
this
meant
he'd
know
a
bunch
about
business
and
about
technology,
but
we
later
found
it
just
means
he
has
good
alcohol
tolerance,
and
a
tendency
to
make
painfully
geeky
remarks.
In
his
spare
time,
Tom
plays
too
many
games,
and
reads
sci-fi
while
working
up
a
sweat
on
the
treadmill.
Once
upon
a
time,
he
was
the
winner
of
the
Blizzard
Brood
War
Beta
invitational,
and
#1
on
the
SC
&
BW
ladders
several
times.
Special
Ability
Summon
Beer
:
Tom
briefly
meditates
and
accesses
the
para-plane
of
brewing.
Focusing
this
energy,
he
manifests

existence
