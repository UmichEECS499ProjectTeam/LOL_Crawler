Trivia
Veigar,
Riot's
QA
guy,
is
the
origin
of
the
champion's
name.
He
is
"quite
tall".
All
of
Veigar's
skills
(excluding
Baleful
Strike
)
refer
to
space.
Event
Horizon
a
reference
to
the
edge
of
a
black
hole,
the
point
at
which
light
cannot
escape.
Dark
Matter
a
reference
to
the
undetectable
matter
in
space.
Primordial
Burst
a
reference
to
the
Big
Bang
,
the
prevailing
cosmological
model
that
explains
the
early
development
of
the
Universe.
Equilibrium
,
which
means
"Balance",
is
an
important
concept
in
stellar
and
orbital
physics.
Veigar's
personality
and
appearance
are
similar
to
the
Black
Mage,
a
character
from
the
web
comic
8-Bit
Theatre
.
Veigar
is
one
of
four
champions
that
can
infinitely
increase
their
stats
by
using
their
abilities
-
ability
power
in
Veigar's
case.
The
other
three
are
Nasus
,
Sion
and
Thresh
.
When
Veigar
uses
his
ultimate
to
kill
an
enemy
champion,
he
will
laugh
malevolently.
Veigar
possess
the
most
laugh
emotes
of
any
champion,
at
6.
Quotes
Veigar's
quotes
"I
will
swallow
your
soul!"
and
"Even
now,
your
loved
ones
suffer!"
are
similar
to
quotes
from
The
Evil
Dead
franchise.
Skins
Classic
Veigar
closely
resembles
the
Black
Mage
from
the
Final
Fantasy
series.
White
Mage
Veigar
does
not
have
the
robe
of
the
White
Mage
but
uses
a
similar
color
palette.
Golden
Alistar
,
Assassin
Master
Yi
,
and
White
Mage
Veigar
are
the
only
skins
priced
at
390
,
making
them
the
cheapest
skins
in
the
store,
excluding
sale
prices
and
free/promotional
skins.
Leprechaun
Veigar
replaces
Baleful
Strike's
particles
with
four
leaf
clovers,
Event
Horizon's
particles
with
floating
four
leaf
clovers,
and
Dark
Matter's
falling
trail
with
a
solid
rainbow.
Veigar
Greybeard
is
a
direct
reference
to
Gandalf
the
Grey
from
the
The
Lord
of
the
Rings
,
written
by
J.R.R.
Tolkien
.
Superb
Villain
Veigar
changes
Event
Horizon
particles
into
mechanic
pyramid-like
structures
that
resemble
the
claw
on
his
hand.
Superb
Villain
Veigar
holds
a
scepter
that
closely
resembles
the
"
Runed
Arcanite
Rod
"
item
in
World
of
Warcraft.
Contrary
to
the
belief
of
some
of
the
community,
Superb
Villain
Veigar
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
popular
YouTube
personality
TotalBiscuit.
[1]
Bad
Santa
Veigar
is
a
possible
reference
to
the
Grinch
,
a
green,
hairy
creature
that
stole
every
gift
during
Christmas.
Bad
Santa
Veigar
changes
the
particles
of
all
of
Veigar's
spells;
Baleful
Strike
becomes
a
Christmas
tree
shaped
cookie,
Dark
Matter
becomes
a
breaking
colored
bauble,
Event
Horizon's
area
is
marked
by
Christmas
trees
and
lights,
and
Primordial
Burst
becomes
a
wrapped
present.
The
skin
also
features
a
Recall
animation
where
Veigar
enters
a
chimney.
Relations
The
reason
why
was
Veigar
in
Noxian
prison
was,
according
to
reports
from
Noxian
authorities,
Veigar
was
amongst
“a
handful”
of
yordles
arrested
for
trading
illegal
goods
in
Noxus.
Lulu
is
friends
with
Veigar.
After
his
failed
attempt
to
steal
The
Mothership,
Veigar
was
shot
down
by
Teemo
during
his
escape.
