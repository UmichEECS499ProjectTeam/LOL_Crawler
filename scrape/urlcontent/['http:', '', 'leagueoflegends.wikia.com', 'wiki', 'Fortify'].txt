"You

The
subject
of
this
article
was
removed
from

displayed
is
no
longer
relevant
to
League

but
exists
here
for
historical
purposes.
Fortify
Fortify
Effect
Grants
invulnerability
to
all
allied
turrets
and
causes
them
to
attack
100%
faster
for
7
seconds.
While
Fortify
is
ready
to
cast,
you
deal
9
bonus
damage
to
minions.

Example
Fortify
was
a
'non-targeted'
summoner
spell
that
buffed
your
turrets
globally.
Fortify
was
removed
from
League
of
Legends
with
the
November
15th,
2011
patch
V1.0.0.129
.
Contents

Strategy
Fortify
was
mainly
used
defensively
to
prevent
towers
from
taking
damage
and
clearing
creeps
faster
than
normally.
However
it
was
also
a
very
effective
method
to
punish
tower
divers
or
quickly
do
damage
to
foes
that
got
caught
by
pulls
and
taunts
like
Rocket
Grab
and
Puncturing
Taunt
.
Notes
When
you
use
Fortify,
any
hits
to
the
protected
tower
won't
proc
certain
abilities
that
would
have
worked
before.
For
example,
Jax's
Relentless
Assault
,
Guinsoo's
Rageblade
,
and
Master
Yi's
Double
Strike
.
Fortify
can
be
used
while
your
champion
is
dead.
While
fortified,
a
turret
grants
you
assists
and
kills
when
it
last-hits
or
assists
in
killing
an
enemy
champion
as
if
you
were
dealing
the
damage,
and
not
the
turret.
This
does
not,
however,
apply
to
minion
kills.
Trivia
The
bonus
damage
to
minions
is
an
on-hit
effect
and
only
applies
to
standard
attacks
and
abilities
that
specifically
mention
applying
on-hit
effects
(e.g.
Ezreal's
Mystic
Shot
or
Nasus's
Siphoning
Strike
).
After
the
V1.0.0.129
patch
update,
players
who
achieved
summoner
level
4
reported
having
the
message
that
they
have
learned
Fortify.
This
tooltip
may
have
been
left
out
during
the
patch's
installation.
