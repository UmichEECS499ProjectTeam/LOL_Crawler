Redirected
from
Gifting
feature
The
Gifting
Center
is
a
feature
that
lets
one
unlock
RP,
Champions,
and/or
Skins
for
a
friend
on
their
friends
list
as
a
gift.
The
gifting
center
first
appeared
during
the
2012
Snowdown
Showdown
event.
Announcement
made
by
Hippalus
[1]
'
Tis
the
season
for
giving,
so
this
Snowdown
we
wanted
to
offer
you
all
the
opportunity
to
spread
some
holiday
cheer.
In
the
coming
patch
you'll
be
able
to
buy
champions,
skins,
and
RP
as
gifts
for
the
significant
summoners
in
your
life.
The
gifting
center
will
only
be
open
for
a
limited
time,
so
be
sure
to
plan
your
holiday
shopping
accordingly.
Here’s
how
to
give
to
a
friend:
Click
on
the
Gifting
Center
in
the
store.
Choose
the
type
of
gift
you'd
like
to
purchase;
you
can
give
champions
and
skins
with
your
RP,
or
buy
RP
to
give
to
a
friend.
Choose
a
friend.
Fill
in
your
payment
information
if
you're
gifting
RP,
or
select
the
skin
or
champion
you'd
like
to
purchase
for
your
friend;
you'll
be
notified
if
your
friend
is
ineligible
to
receive
the
gift.
Add
a
touch
of
holiday
cheer
by
filling
in
a
personal
message.
Your
friend
will
receive
his/her
present
along
with
your
Snowdown
sentiments
the
next
time
he/she
logs
in.
This
is
the
first
time
that
we've
offered
gifting,
so
we’ve
got
a
few
rules
in
place
to
protect
your
account
from
any
funny
business
or
uncouth
shenanigans.
Here's
an
overview:
You
need
to
purchase
any
skins,
champions,
or
RP
that
you
plan
on
giving
away:
we
know
that
you
might
have
some
items
in
your
inventory
that
you’re
not
using
that
frequently,
but
re-gifting
is
only
classy
when
Amumu
does
it
You
can
only
give
to
summoners
you’ve
had
on
your
friends
list
since
early
December:
we
apologize
if
you’re
smitten
with
a
new
acquaintance,
but
for
your
own
protection
there’s
no
adding
someone
and
then
immediately
showering
them
in
gifts
You
must
be
at
least
level
20
to
send
a
gift
and
level
10
to
receive
one:
gifting
is
available
for
two
weeks,
so
if
you
want
to
be
a
precocious
gift-giver,
level
fast
There
are
other
restrictions
on
who
can
send
gifts
(no
banned
accounts)
and
how
many
gifts
you
can
send
or
receive
per
day
(generally
3/day):
plan
your
gift-giving
needs
accordingly.
Now
that
the
fine
print
is
out
of
the
way,
let’s
get
back
to
what’s
really
important:
the
spirit
of
giving.
When
the
next
patch
lands,
throw
on
your
Santa
hat
and
head
over
to
the
store
to
start
your
holiday
shopping.

the
Gifting

was
new
at
the
time,
it

released

a
trial
run
and
taken
offline
after
the
event
for
more
work.
