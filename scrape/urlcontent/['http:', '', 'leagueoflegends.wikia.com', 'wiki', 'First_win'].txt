Influence
Points
,
or
IP,
are
a
measure
of
a
summoner's
influence
in
the
League
of
Legends
rewarded
based
on
their
performance
on
the
Fields
of
Justice.
The
amount
of
IP
rewarded
varies
on
the
outcome
of
the
game,
the
game
type,
and
the
length
of
the
match.
Influence
points
can
be
used
to
permanently
unlock
champions

Determining
Factors
Since
patch
V1.0.0.111
,
the
amount
of
Influence
Points
awarded
for
a
given
match
depends
on
these
rules:
It
increases
linearly
with
the
duration
of
the
game.
[1]
For
each
Field
of
Justice
there
is
a
floor
and
cap
for
IP
gained
per
match.
Games
longer
than
the
cap
or
shorter
than
the
floor
grant
the
same
IP
as
a
game
with
length
corresponding
to
the
length
of
the
cap.
The
floor
does
not
apply
to
Co-op
vs.
AI
games,
the
cap
is
not
tested.
On
Summoner's
Rift
these
lower
and
upper
limits
are
at
25
minutes
(76
IP
for
a
win)
and
55
minutes
(145
IP
for
a
win).
[1]
On
Twisted
Treeline
the
floor
is
at
20
minutes
(64
IP
for
a
win)
and
the
cap
is
at
55
minutes
(145
IP
for
a
win).
The
precise
limits
for
the
Crystal
Scar
are
not
known,
the
floor
seems
to
be
7
minutes,
additional
testing
is
needed.
It
was
previously
believed
to
be
20
minutes
as
surrender
is
available
at
15
minutes
similar
to
the
Twisted
Treeline.
The
cap
is
different
on
ranked
games.
IP
boost
grants
168
IP
on
ranked
games
on
Summoner's
Rift,
so
it
appears
the
cap
is
65
minutes
for
ranked
games
on
Summoner's
Rift.
For
a
win,
the
reward
is
approximately:
18
IP
+
2.
312
per
minute
IP.
[1]
For
a
loss,
the
reward
is
approximately:
16
IP
+
1.
405
per
minute
IP.
[1]
An
active
Wins
IP
Boost
gives
you
a
flat
amount
of
IP
equivalent
to
the
minimum
IP
you
could
get
from
a
game
matching
the
duration
of
the
cap
(for
whichever
game
mode
you
are
playing).
A
custom
game
has
a
penalty
of
25%.
Custom
games
only
grant
IP
when
teams
are
balanced.
(example:
2vs2,
NOT
2vs3)
Co-op
vs.
AI
and
custom
games
have
separate
limit
timers
which
reset
daily,
after
180
minutes
for
Co-op
vs.
AI
and
120
minutes
for
custom
games
no
IP
is
earned.
Twisted
Treeline
in
Co-op
vs.
AI
does
not
have
a
limit
timer.
A
win,
in
any
game
type
except
custom,
will
award
the
"First
Win
of
the
Day"
bonus
if
available.
This
bonus
is
a
fixed
150
IP
which
is
not
affected
by
boosts
or
penalties.
When
awarded,
this
bonus
becomes
unavailable
for
22
hours.
Co-op
vs
AI
Gamemode
Modifiers
Co-op
vs.
AI
matches
have
penalties
depending
on
the
summoner
level
and
difficulty.
A
game
shorter
than
7
minutes
does
not
grant
any
IP
and
as
such
also
no
first
win
of
the
day.
This
may
also
apply
to
regular
games,
but
is
unlikely
to
happen.
The
rule
for
minimum
IP
reward
does
not
apply
(a
match
shorter
than
25
minutes
will
give
less
IP
than
a
match
of
25
minutes).
The
rule
for
maximum
IP
reward
does
apply.

The
game
time
is
always
rounded
down,
meaning
a
game
of
35:59
grants
the
same
amount
as
a
35:00
minute
game.
Dominion
has
a
special
bonus
that
is
given
depending
on
how
well
your
team
did.
The
more
hp
your
nexus
has
if
you
win
the
larger
the
bonus,
the
less
hp
their
nexus
has
if
you
lose
the
larger
your
bonus.
