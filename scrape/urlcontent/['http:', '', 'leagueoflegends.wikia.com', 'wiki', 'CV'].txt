Example
Clairvoyance
is
a
'targeted'
Summoner
spell.
It
is
mainly
used
for
scouting,
aiming
skills,
avoiding
enemy
ganks
and
setting
up
ganks
of
your
own.
It
cannot
detect
invisible
units,
but
it
can
see
into
brush.
Unlike
wards
,
Clairvoyance
need
not
be
"placed"
into
a
specific
patch
of
brush,
but
instead
reveals
all
brush
within
its
range.

Strategy
Clairvoyance
is
generally
taken
by
a
support
champion
such
as
Sona
or
Soraka
so
that
carries
may
choose
more
self-serving
Summoner
Spells.
On
Summoner's
Rift
,
use
Clairvoyance
early
on
the
enemy
fountain
(between
5
and
15s)
to
see
enemies'
starting
items
and
lane
setup.
Enemy
champions'
items
will
be
updated
on
the
summary
window
(Tab
or
O).
Clairvoyance
is
primarily
used
to
check
the
enemy
jungler's
progress,
and
prevent
ganks
from
the
jungler
or
laners
that
are
"MIA".
If
you
know
the
enemy
jungler
is
invading
your
jungle,
cast
Clairvoyance
at
their
probable
location,
hopefully
catching
them
off
guard
and
granting
your
team
a
kill.
You
can
use
Clairvoyance
during
a
team
fight
near
brush
to
prevent
your
team
from
losing
line
of
sight.
Notes
If
Clairvoyance
only
extends
over
half
of
a
brush
patch,
an
enemy
unit
can
remain
unseen
in
the
other
half.
The
"eye"
that
is
placed
at
the
Clairvoyanced
area
can
be
seen
by
the
enemy,
even
if
it
is
in
the
fog
of
war.
Clairvoyance
will
reset
the
markers
for
neutral
monster
camps
on
the
minimap.
Casting
Clairvoyance
does
not
interrupt
Recalls
channel.
The
"eye"
(green
by
ally
and
red
by
enemy)
of
the
effect
indicates
its
duration.
Trivia
Clairvoyance
has
the
second
shortest
cooldown
of
all
the
summoner
spells
at
60
seconds,
preceded
by
Smite
at
40
seconds.
