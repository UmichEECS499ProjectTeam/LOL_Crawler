Abilities
are
what
a
champion
uses
on
the
Field
of
Justice
.
The
unique
nature
of
a
champion's
abilities
set
them
apart
from
the
other
champions.
A
champion's
abilities
also
determine
the
champion's
role
in
his
or
her
team,
how
the
champion
should
be
played,
and
what
items
,
runes
,
and
masteries
should
be
gotten
to
maximize
effectiveness.
Summoner
spells
are
not
abilities.
Baron
Nashor
and
Vilemaw
are
the
only
non-champions
to
utilize
abilities,
although
the
Dragon
has
a
passive
on-hit
DoT
called
"Burning".
Archetypes
Every
champion
has
at
least
five
unique
abilities.
Four
of
these
abilities
are
learned
over
the
course
of
a
battle
using
ability
points,
and
the
fifth
is
an
Innate
Ability
.
One
ability
point
is
granted
to
every
champion
at
the
start
of
a
game,
and
another
point
is
earned
by
each
champion
every
time
they
level
up.
A
champion
can
level
up
individual
abilities
by
spending
subsequent
ability
points
in
those
abilities
which
they
have
already
learned.
Basic
Ability
:
All
champions
feature
three
basic
abilities,
which
are
available
from
level
1
to
a
maximum
of
five
ranks.
Basic
abilities
cannot
be
ranked
higher
than
half
the
level
of
the
champion
(rounded
up),
meaning
a
new
rank
is
available
every
odd
single-digit
level,
and
requiring
level
9
to
max
any
individual
skill.
Udyr
has
no
ultimate
ability,
featuring
only
four
basic
abilities.
Yasuo
has
four
basic
abilities.
Elise
,
Jayce
,
Lee
Sin
,
Quinn
and
Rengar
each
have
six
basic
abilities.
Including
their
evolved
forms,
Syndra
,
Kha'Zix
,
Karma
and
Viktor
also
have
six
basic
abilities.
Innate
Ability
:
A
champion’s
innate
ability
passively
affects
the
champion
for
the
entire
match.
Every
champion
has
one,
and
these
abilities
cannot
be
improved
with
ability
points
gained
on
level-up.
Syndra
features
an
innate
abilitiy
with
four
independent
effects.
Prior
to
her
minor
kit
rework
in
V3.9
,
Shyvana
also
possessed
a
passive
with
four
independent
effects.
This
is
no
longer
the
case,
however.
Prior
to
Shyvana's
release,
Vladimir
and
Akali
held
the
record
with
two
effects
each.
Ultimate
Ability
:
A
champion's
fourth
and
feature
ability
is
their
ultimate.
Summoners
cannot
invest
skill
points
into
their
ultimates
until
at
least
champion
level
6
and
cannot
again
until
levels
11
and
16,
to
a
maximum
of
three
ranks.
Nidalee's
Aspect
of
the
Cougar
replaces
her
basic
abilities
with
a
set
of
ultimate
abilities.
As
such,
Nidalee
has
access
to
four
ultimate
abilities;
the
most
of
any
champion.
While
active,
Nidalee
has
access
to
no
basic
abilities.
Jayce
,
Nocturne
,
Riven
Twisted
Fate
,
and
Quinn
each
have
two
ultimate
abilities.
Including
their
evolved
forms,
Kha'Zix
and
Syndra
also
have
two
ultimate
abilities.
Elise
,
Jayce
and
Karma
are
the
only
champions
with
access
to
their
ultimate
abilities
at
level
one.
Each
may
invest
skill
points
into
their
ultimates
at
levels
6,
11
and
16,
allowing
it
to
reach
rank
4.
Jayce
and
Quinn
,
with
two
ultimates
and
six
basic
abilities
each,
hold
the
record
for
the
most
abilities
on
a
single
champion.

Self-Buffs:
These
are
abilities
that
grant
passive
effects
once
activated.
These
effects
last
either
a
fixed
amount
of
time,
such
as
Kog'Maw's
Bio-Arcane
Barrage
,
or
last
until
a
one-off
component
has
been
used,
such
as
Rammus's
Powerball
.
Stocked:
These
abilities
have
a
extremely
low
cooldown
but
rely
on
"stock"
to
use.
Stock
is
generated
over
time
and
there
is
a
capacity
unique
to
each
skill
to
how
many
stocks
can
be
stocked.
When
the
ability
is
used,
it
uses
up
1
Stock.
Cooldown

affects
the
time
at
which
stock
is
generated.

H-28G
Evolution

Passive
ability:
These
abilities
are
passive
abilities
that
have
persistent
effects,
and
do
not
need
to
be
activated
per
se.
However,
some
passive
abilities
are
unavailable
under
specific
conditions,
such
as
while
the
ability
is
on
cooldown
(
Blitzcrank's
Static
Field
)
or
upon
taking
damage
(
Teemo's
Move
Quick
).
The
ability
will
be
activated
again
as
soon
as
the
specific
condition
has
passed,
i.e.
the
ability
is
off
cooldown,
or
no
damage
has
been
taken
for
a
certain
amount
of
time.
These
are
often
compared
to
innate
abilities.
Toggle
ability:
These
abilities
are
used
by
activating
them
and
remain
active
with
persistent
effects
until
they
are
deactivated.
The
toggling
of
an
ability
is
not
considered
an
activation,
for
the
purposes
of
Sheen
or
Force
Pulse
,
but
mana
consumption
of
toggled
abilities
will
stack
Tear
of
the
Goddess
.

Special
toggles:
These
abilities
are
listed
as
being
toggles,
but
have
their
own
set
of
conditions:
these
abilities
do
count
as
activating
an
ability,
and
will
toggle-off
automatically
if
the
champion
moves
too
far
away.
Anivia's
Glacial
Storm
(will
also
toggle-off
if
she's
disrupted
)
Maokai's
Vengeful
Maelstrom
Stance
ability
:
A
type
of
ability
currently
unique
to
Udyr
and
Sona
.
Each
stance
has
an
individual
cooldown
and
a
shared
global
cooldown.
Every
stance
provides
an
effect
that
lasts
as
long
as
the
stance
is
active
as
well
as
an
activation
effect.
Rammus's
Defensive
Ball
Curl
and
Powerball
are
described
as
stances
in
their
ability
descriptions,
and
function
like
stances
in
that
only
one
can
be
active
simultaneously.
Baron
Nashor's
Voracious
Corrosion
and
Wrath
of
the
Ancients
use
a
stance
system.
Attributes
Abilities
have
certain
attributes
that
determine
how
they
are
used
in
game.
These
attributes
include
area,
cooldown,
cost,
effect,
and
range.
Cooldown:
All
abilities
have
a
cooldown,
a
length
of
time
after
the
use
of
the
ability
in
which
the
ability
cannot
be
used
again.
Cooldown
reduction
reduces
this
time,
to
a
maximum
of
40%
reduction
of
the
ability's
initial
cooldown.
Some
champions
have
abilities
that
refresh/reduce
the
cooldown
period.
Some
abilities
have
a
secondary
active
function.
The
ability
goes
on
cooldown
after
the
secondary
function
has
been
triggered
or
the
window
for
triggering
it
expires.
Cost:
Most
abilities,
but
not
all,
have
a
specific
cost
associated
with
them.
Generally
abilities
cost
mana
,
though
some
champions
use
health
,
energy
,
or
other
resource
mechanics.
When
the
ability
is
used,
the
champion
loses
the
cost
of
the
ability.
If
the
champion
has
less
than
the
cost
of
the
ability,
the
ability
cannot
be
used
and
its
HUD
icon
changes
color.
Range:
The
range
of
an
ability
determines
how
far
away
a
target
can
be
and
still
take
the
effect
of
the
ability.
This
range
generally
does
not
appear
on
in-game
tooltips,
but
placing
one's
cursor
over
the
ability
will
display
the
range
and
targeting
for
that
ability.
Some
abilities
have
Global
range,
meaning
their
range
includes
the
entire
map.
Targeting:
All
abilities
which
affect
a
unit
other
than
the
champion
casting
it
are
targeted
in
some
way.
If
an
ability
has
a
specific
target
it
will
hit,
it
is
referred
to
as
targeted.
Other
forms
of
targeting
are
referred
to
by
their
type:
Area
of
Effect
(AoE)
abilities
can
affect
more
than
one
target
in
an
area.
The
affected
area
is
generally
circular,
but
conic
or
linear
areas
are
also
possible.
Certain
abilities,
such
as
Diana's
Crescent
Strike
,
may
have
completely
unique
areas
of
effect.
Skillshots
are
projectile-based
abilities,
generally
cast
in
a
line
away
from
the
champions
location,
which
only
affect
targets
the
projectile
collides
with.
Click-on
abilities
require
a
target
and
vision
of
it
to
cast.
Most
of
these
abilities
are
to
either
apply
a
buff
or
to
use
a
strong
projectile
to
assault
the
target.
A
simple
click
is
all
that
is
needed
to
start
casting
a
Click-on
at
a
target
Cast
time:
While
most
abilities
have
either
an
instant
cast
time
or
a
slightly
delayed
instant
cast
of
0.
5
seconds,
there
are
several
which
prevent
the
caster
from
taking
any
other
action
while
the
ability
is
cast.
Most
of
those,
called
channeled
abilities
,
can
be
interrupted,
either
by
the
caster
or
by
any
form
of
Crowd
Control
(excluding
Slows,
Snares,
and
Blinds)
applied
by
an
enemy
unit.
Effects
See
Category:Advanced
attributes#Abilities
Every
ability
has
an
effect.
These
effects
vary
widely,
but
can
generally
be
broken
down
as
follows:
Buffs
:
Increase
the
target's
statistics
while
active.
Passive
and
Toggle
abilities
are
most
likely
to
have
this
type
of
effect.
Active
abilities
which
give
buffs
have
higher
bonuses
than
Passives
or
Toggles
due
to
their
limited
duration.
Some
champions
have
AoE
buffs
for
nearby
allies,
referred
to
as
auras
.
Crowd
Control
:
This
category
includes
all
effects
that
reduce
the
fighting
ability
of
enemy
units.
The
page
includes
a
table
with
notes
on
each.
Damage
:
Offensive
abilities
that
deal
damage.
This
damage
can
be
either
physical,
magic,
or
true,
and
generally
procs
spell
vamp
,
unless
the
description
states
it
applies
on-hit
effects
.
Most
damage-dealing
abilities
scale
with
a
champion's
attack
damage
,
ability
power
,
or
both.
Some
abilities
deal
damage
over
time
.
Damage
Reduction:
Reduces
damage
dealt
to
the
target
for
the
duration.
This
damage
reduction
does
not
apply
to
true
damage
and
applies
before
reduction
from
armor
or
magic
resistance.
Gold
:
Gives
champions
more
gold
than
the
base
rate,
either
over
time
or
on
kill.
Healing
:
Heals
a
target.
Healing
generally
scales
with
ability
power
.
Support
champions
are
most
likely
to
have
healing
abilities,
and
are
the
only
ones
to
have
healing
abilities
which
target
a
champion
other
than
themselves.
Several
non-support
champions
have
abilities
that
heal
only
themselves.
Immunity:
Prevents
certain
types
of
crowd
control
from
affecting
the
target,
which
is
usually
the
champion
using
the
ability.
Invulnerability:
The
target
cannot
be
damaged
for
the
duration.
Currently
only
Kayle's
Intervention
provides
a
temporary
invulnerability.
Certain
abilities
also
make
units
untargetable
,
such
as
Fizz's
Playful
.
See
the
page
for
more
details.
Movement
:
Moves
the
champion
or
the
champion's
target
from
place
to
place.
This
can
be
a
dash
,
a
blink,
or
a
teleport.
Many
of
these
abilities
allow
a
champion
to
move
through
otherwise
solid
obstacles/terrain
in
a
similar
manner
to
the
summoner
spell
Flash
.
Resurrection:
Brings
target
back
to
life
if
reduced
to
below
0
health,
though
other
conditions
may
apply.
Shield
:
Absorbs
a
certain
amount
of
damage
for
the
target,
in
place
of
losing
health.
Stealth
:
Target
becomes
unseen
and
untargetable
until
revealed
or
duration
expires.
The
page
contains
further
information,
including
means
of
detecting
stealthed
champions.
