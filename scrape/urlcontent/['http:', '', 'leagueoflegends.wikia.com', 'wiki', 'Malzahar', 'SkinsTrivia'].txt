Trivia
Malzahar
was
designed
by
Ezreal
.
Malzahar
is
voiced
by
Vic
Mignogna
.
Before
his
official
announcement,
he
was
named
Al'Zahar
on
the
Public
Test
Realm.
Malzahar
was
the
only
Champion
who
caused
malfunctions
on
the
Public
Test
Realm
due
to
its
changes.
His
/dance
is
a
direct
reference
to
MC
Hammer's
famous
"Can't
Touch
This"
dance.
A
side-by-side
comparison
can
be
seen
here
.
Malzahar's
voidling
now
dances
when

dances

pet
,
along
with
Annie
,
Elise
,
Heimerdinger
,
Mordekaiser
,
Shaco
and
Yorick
Malzahar's
backstory
is
perhaps
a
reference
to
Abdul
Alhazred
from
the
Necronomicon,
who
became
a
prophet
of
Cthulhu
after
being
compelled
by
visions
to
walk
through
the
Arabian
desert
without
any
supplies.
Skins
Shadow
Prince
Malzahar
may
be
a
reference
to
the
Prince
of
Persia
franchise.
Vizier
Malzahar
is
a
reference
to
a
title
often
held
in
Middle-Eastern
governments,
following
his
Middle-Eastern
themes.
Djinn
Malzahar
is
an
alternative
spelling
reference
of
Jinn
.
In
Middle
Eastern
culture
and
Islamic
mythology,
the
(d)jinn
are
fire
spirits
similar
to
angels
who
rebelled
against
Allah
(God)
in
ancient
times.
The
English
word
'genie'
is
a
corruption
of
the
singular
form
of
'(d)jinn',
'(d)jinni';
the
genies
of
modern
pop
culture
are
loosely
based
on
these
folk
tales.
Overlord
Malzahar
may
be
a
reference
to
the
Overlord
video
game
franchise.
His
voidling
represents
the
minions
that
serve
The
Overlord
with
their
armor
on.
Relations
Malzahar
is
from
the
Shurima
Desert
and
was
born
a
Seer,
blessed
with
the
gift
of
foresight.
His
talent,
though
unrefined,
promised
to
be
one
of
Runeterra's
greatest
boons.
Malzahar
traveled
to
Icathia
and
saw
visions
of
Void
creatures
consuming
Runeterra
.
Believing
this
as
an
inevitable
fate,
Malzahar
now
serves
the
Void.
Malzahar
was
the
one
who
enticed
Kog'Maw
into
joining
the
League
.
Malzahar
is
the
prophet
of
a
growing
subculture
of
Void
cultists.

wishes
for
Kassadin
to
join
forces
with
him.
In
