Shroud
is
an
advanced
item
in
League
of
Legends
.
[1]
Background
Deep
in
the
icy
wastelands
of
Valoran's
easternmost
pole,
there
is
rumored
to
be
a
frozen
loom.
Its
pedals,
levers,
and
weave
all
made
from
smooth,
pure
ice.
It
is
this
mysterious
loom
that
is
said
to
be
the
origin
of
the
magnificent
Glacial
Shroud.

Strategy
Glacial
Shroud
is
a
fairly
cost
effective
item:
for
the
combine
cost
of
250
gold
,
it
grants
10%
cooldown
reduction,
5
armor
and
50
mana.
As
one
of
the
few
items
that
grants
a
combination
of
armor,
mana
and
cooldown
reduction,
Glacial
Shroud
is
an
affordable
advanced
item
in
most
fighter
or
tanky
mage
builds,
later
to
be
upgraded
for
even
more
armor
and
other
stats.
