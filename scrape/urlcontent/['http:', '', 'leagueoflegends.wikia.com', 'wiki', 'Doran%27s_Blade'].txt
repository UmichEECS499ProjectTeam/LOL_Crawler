Doran's
Blade
is
a
basic
item
in
League
of
Legends
.
[1]
It
is
a
useful
starting
item
for
any
champion
going
for
a
DPS
build.

Gold
Efficiency
Doran's
Blade
is
gold
efficient
even
without
its
passive.
Strategy
Stacking
Doran's
Blades
is
a
viable
tactic
for
champions
who
need
survivability.
This
is
because
Doran's
items
have
a
very
low
cost
for
the
stats
they
give,
balanced
by
the
fact
that
they
cannot
be
upgraded.
Getting
2
Doran's
Blades
can
also
be
useful
to
get
an
early
lane
advantage
over
your
opponent,
in
particular
if
going
against
the
enemy
carry.
In
this
situation
however,
you
should
press
that
advantage,
as
he
will
complete
his
core
build
sooner.
The
on-hit
heal
from
multiple
Doran's
Blades
WILL
stack.
The
stat
per
gold
of
Doran's
Blade
(when
excluding
health
and
mana
regeneration)
is
the
worst
among
the
three
Doran's
items.
Doran's
Blade
falls
off
as
the
game
progresses,
due
to
the
heal
amount
being
fixed,
so
it
does
not
scale
with
increasing
damage
output.

Background
They
say
Effrem
E.
Doran
was
born
with
a
hammer
in
his
hands
and
a
forge
in
his
heart.
Every
object
he
touched,
he
found
ways
to
improve,
and
he
knew
that
he
was
destined
to
be
a
brilliant
artificer.
At
the
age
of
15,
he
was
invited
to
the
League
with
an
offer
to
assume
the
role
of
Master
Artificer,
a
dream
come
true
and
an
unprecedented
honor
for
one
so
young.
However,
fate
had
other
plans.
En
route,
his
carriage
broke
an
axle.
When
he
leaned
down
to
inspect
it,
he
was
kicked
in
the
head
by
his
donkey,
a
stern
blow.
He
stumbled
back
onto
the
wagon,
but
when
he
arrived
at
the
Institute
of
War
he
was
a
different
boy.
The
kick
had
rendered
his
mind
soft,
but
it
hadn’t
robbed
him
of
his
passion.
He
still
wanted
nothing
other
than
to
craft,
but
where
once
he
may
have
created
singular
masterpieces,
he
now
crafted…somewhat
simpler
items,
and
many
of
them.
He
is
a
kind,
goofy,
good-hearted
soul,
and
he
takes
pride
in
the
work
he
does.
His
items
are
daily
selected
by
champions
on
the
Fields
of
Justice
,
and
he
has
a
permanent
home
at
the
Institute
of
War.
Doran's
Blade
,
Doran's
Shield
and
Doran's
Ring
are
some
of
the
more
famous
crafts.
