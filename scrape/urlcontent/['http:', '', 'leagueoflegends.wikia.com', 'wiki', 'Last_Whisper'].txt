Last

becomes
more
effective
at
penetrating
armor
than
The
Brutalizer
when
an
opponent
has
more
than
28.6
armor.
It
becomes
more
effective
than
Youmuu's
Ghostblade
at
57.1
armor.
It
becomes
more
effective
than
five
stacks
of
The
Black
Cleaver's
debuff
(plus
its
flat
penetration)
at
100
armor.
Percentage
armor
penetration
stacks
multiplicatively
with
other
percentage
armor
penetration
abilities.
If
the
increased
physical
damage
from
the
35%
amour
penetration
can
be
thought
of
as
increased
AD,
the
passive
must
increase
damage
by
23.89
points
(860g/36g
per
AD
=
23.89
AD),
in
order
to
be
gold
efficient.
For
this
to
occur,
“Arm*(AD-44.367)
>
6825.7”,
where
Arm
is
the
targets
armour.
This
can
be
rounded
to
“Arm*(AD-45)
>
7000”,
for
ease
of
remembering.
A
graph
of
the
unrounded
equation
can
be
seen
to
the
right.
