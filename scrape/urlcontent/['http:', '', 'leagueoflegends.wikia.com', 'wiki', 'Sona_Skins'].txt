Trivia
Sona
is
designed
by
Colt
'Ezreal'
Hallam
[1]
and
reworked
by
Miyuki
'Shurelia'
Mitsuhashi
.
Sona
is
voiced
by
Erin
Fitzgerald
,
who
also
voices
Janna
.
Sona's
classic
splash
art
from
the
3.02
patch
was
drawn
by
Shilin
Huang
.
The
name
"Sona"
is
derived
from
the
Latin
prefix
denoting
sound,
"son-",
attached
to
the
Latin
suffix
for
feminine
objects,
"a".
Sona's
name
in
Hindi
means
"gold".
Sona's
name
and
abilities
are
closely
related
to
"sonar",
which
is
the
technique
that
propagates
sound
to
navigate,
detects
and
also
communicate.
Sona's
abilities
greatly
alludes
to
the
'active
sonar'
technology,
which
she
emits
pulses(in
her
case,
waves)
of
sound.
A
"
maven
"
is
someone
highly
skilled
in
a
field
who
wishes
to
teach
others
in
said
field.
Sona's
weapons
are
all
zithers,
excluding
the
one
she
used
in
her
Arcade
skin,
an
electrical
keyboard
with
few
arcade
cabinet's
control
panel.
Hence,
she
is
called
a
'zitherist'.
Sona
seems
to
be
able
to
make
her
large
zither
floats
in
front
of
her.
Playing
a
zither
while
standing
is
actually
an
unorthodox
way
of
playing
it,
since
zithers
are
particularly
heavy
to
carry
that
it
doesn't
use
frames
like
guitars
to
carry
it
around.
Sona
is
the
second
champion
to
use
the
stance
mechanic,
the
first
being
Udyr
.
The
name
of
Sona's
weapon,
the
"Etwahl",
is
pronounced
the
same
as
the
French
word
"étoile",
which
means
"star".
The
Etwahl
is
likely
a
reference
to
the
guzheng
,
a
Chinese
string
instrument.
"Etwahl"
is
also
an
anagram
for
"wealth",
symbolizing
her
adoptive
mother's
only
notable
quality,
as
well
as
a
reminder
that
it's
Sona's
source
of
power.
A
power
chord
is
a
type
of
chord
that
consists
of
a
doubled
root
note
and
the
fifth.
It's
a
key
element
of
many
styles
of
rock
music.
Sona
is
a
mute,
yet
can
talk
to
the
Summoner.
She
claims
that
only
"you"
can
hear
her
and
says
the
phrase
"From
my
mind,
to
yours."
This
indicates
the
mental
connection
between
a
Summoner
and
their
Champion,
which
is
a
recurring
feature
in
League
Judgements.
Her
appearance
and
the
general
musical
theme
bears
certain
similarity
to
Hatsune
Miku
.
Each
of
Sona's
abilities
have
varying
ambient
music,
playing
whenever
its
aura
is
active.
When
Hymn
of
Valor
is
the
active
aura,
the
League
of
Legends
theme
can
be
heard
from
the
Etwahl.
Hymn
is
a
type
of
song,
usually
alluded
to
religiousness.
In
Greek,
it
means
"song
of
praises",
practically
equivalent
to
the
Islamic
'Dhikr'
(chant
of
remembrance
and/or
praises).
Sona's
ultimate,
Crescendo
,
actually
triggers
the
dance
emote
in
addition
to
the
stun.
Crescendo
means
"gradually
becoming
louder"
in
Italian,
it
refers
to
the
amplification
of
volume
instead.
Quotes
The
tune
of
Sona's
taunt
has
the
same
tune
of
the
announcer's
"Finish
him!"
from
the
Mortal
Kombat
series.
"Allegrissimo"
means
to
play
the
music
faster,
in
a
very
lively
or
cheerful
way,
from
Italian.
"Brioso,
Brioso!"
means
lively,
merry,
proud
and
high
spirited,
from
both
Italian
and
Spanish.
"Adagio"
means
gently,
slowly
or
simply
more
graceful
and
leisurely
in
Italian.
Skins
Sona's
classic
skin
bears
striking
similarities
to
Hatsune
Miku
,
a
popular
Japanese
singing
synthesizer
application
with
a
human
persona.
Pentakill
Sona
shares
a
theme
with
Mordekaiser
,
Karthus
,
Yorick
,
and
Olaf
.
In
the
Chinese
art
for
Pentakill
Sona
,
the
sparks
coming
from
her
instrument
appear
to
spell
the
word
'FAME'.
Muse
Sona
is
based
on
the
Muses
,
figures
from
Greek
mythology
that
were
goddesses
or
spirits
associated
with
memory
and
the
arts.
Many
performers
wrote
songs
in
dedication
to
the
Muses.
Silent
Night
Sona
is
a
reference
to
the
Christmas
carol
"
Silent
Night
".
It
may
also
relate
to
the
origins
of
the
song,
which
was
first
played
on
a
guitar.
If
the
joke
command
is
alternated
with
Kog'Maw
in
proximity
with
his
Reindeer
skin
and
her
using
her
Silent
Night
skin,
they
will
both
play
and
sing
a
section
of
'Deck
the
Halls'
together.
Guqin
Sona
is
a
direct
reference
to
the
guqin
,
a
seven-string
Chinese
instrument.
This
skin
was
released
in
celebration
of
the
Chinese
New
Year.
Arcade
Sona
is
a
reference
to
many
'80s
and
early
'90s
video
game
effects.
The
effect
from
Crescendo
is
a
direct
reference
to
Dance
Dance
Revolution.
The
sequence
is
(↑→)(←)(↑→)(↑)(↑)(↑)
Sona
shares
the
Arcade
theme
with
Hecarim
.
Arcade
Sona
skins
basic
attacks
are
different
depending
on
which
aura
she
is
playing.
Relations
Sona
is
part
of
the
band
Pentakill
,
along
with
other
members
Mordekaiser
,
Karthus
,
Yorick
,
and
Olaf
.
The
band
is
reported
to
have
been
a
huge
success
all
across
Valoran.
Sona
herself
was
one
of
the
founders
of
the
band,
along
with
Mordekaiser.
In
Sona's
reflection
during
her
League
Judgement
it
is
stated
that
her
adoptive
mother,
Lestara
Buvelle,
was
killed
by
the
Etwahl.
Sona's
first
years
were
spent
in
Ionia,
yet,
since
her
adoption
she
has
become
a
resident
of
Demacia.
