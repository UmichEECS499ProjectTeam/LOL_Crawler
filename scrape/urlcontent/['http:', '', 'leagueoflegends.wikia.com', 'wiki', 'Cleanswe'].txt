Example
Cleanse
is
a
'non-targeted'
summoner
spell.
Its
primary
function
is
to
remove
active
crowd
control
effects,
allowing
the
summoner
to
continue
pursuit
or
escape.
Strategy
Cleanse
will
remove
any
and
all
of
the
following
effects:
Blind
,
Charm
,
Fear
(or
Flee
),
Slow
(that
affect
Movement),
Polymorph
,
Silence
,
Root
(sometimes
called
Entangle,
Snare
or
Immobilize),
Stun
and
Taunt
.
Cleanse
will
not
remove
non-CC
effects,
such
as:
damage
over
time,
attack
speed
reductions,
defense
shredding
and
Grievous
Wounds
.
Quicksilver
Sash
is
an
alternative
to
Cleanse
that
will
remove
all
of
these
effects.
However,
Exhaust
is
completely
removed
and
Ignite
has
its
true
damage
over
time
component
removed.
Cleanse
will
provide
3
seconds
of
65%
crowd
control
reduction
after
activation.
This
stacks
multiplicatively
with
other
sources,
such
as
Tenacity
and
champion
abilities.
This
crowd
control
reduction
will
have
no
effect
on
additional
Ignites
but
will
reduce
the
duration
of
movement
speed
slows
from
additional
Exhausts
.
Cleanse
has
no
effect
on
Suppression
,
knock-ups,
knock-backs,
grabs
and
flings.
This
is
true
for
both
the
removal
and
reduction
effects.
Cleanse
will
remove
all
effects
contained
within
the
crowd
control
debuff.
For
example,
it
will
remove
the
following
attack
speed
slows:
Glacial
Storm
,
Crippling
Strike
,
Cripple
,
Wither
,
Ice
Blast
,
Absolute
Zero
,
Warden's
Mail
and
Randuin's
Omen
.
Tryndamere's
Mocking
Shout
is
an
example
of
an
ability
where
the
two
parts
are
separate
debuffs.
Trivia
Previously
the
tool
tip
stated
that
Cleanse
was
able
to
remove
the
Sleep
debuff,
although
no
such
effect
existed
in
the
game.
Cleanse
was
named
Boost
up
until
V0.9.22.15
.
Prior
to
V3.13
Ground
Slam
and
Barrel
Roll
were
the
only
attack
speed
slows
in
the
game
not
connected
to
a
movement
speed
slow
and
so
are
the
only
attack
speed
slows
that
Cleanse
did
not
remove.
