Redirected
from
Snowballing
Snowballs
are
situations
that
gain
momentum
over
the
course
of
time,
analogously
derived
from
a
snowball
rolling
down
a
hill,
picking
up
more
snow
and
momentum
as
it
rolls.
"Snowballing"
generally
describes
the
act
of
using
so
called
"Snowball
items".
A
more
contemporary
use
of
the
word
is
an
individual
or
team
that
has
taken
advantage
of
a
certain
factor
(such
as
the
global
gold
from
slaying
the
Dragon
a
Kill
to
establish
dominance
in
lane)
to
widen
the
gap
between
them
and
their
opponents.

Snowball
items
Snowball
items
are
items
that
make
a
champion
stronger
over
the
course
of
time,
unless
that
champion
is
killed
on
a
regular
basis.
While
granting
only
low
stats
by
themselves,
the
items
allow
the
champion
to
gain
stacks
of
a
certain
effect
which
further
increase
stats
(e.g.
bonus
ability
power
or
attack
damage
).
Each
kill
grants
two
of
these
stacks,
while
an
assist
grants
one
stack.
They
do
not
retroactively
grant
stacks,
i.e.
kills
and
assists
gained
before
the
item
was
bought
will
not
grant
any
stacks.
The
stack
cap
for
the
current
set
of
items
is
20
stacks.
Upon
reaching
that
cap,
an
additional
bonus
is
unlocked
for
as
long
as
no
stacks
are
lost.
When
the
champion
dies
,
they
lose
a
third
of
their
stacks,
rounded
down.
The
stacks
are
bound
to
the
item,
meaning
that
if
you
sell
the
item,
the
stacks
will
be
lost.
Buying
the
item
again
will
not
replenish
the
stacks.
The
snowball
items
give
a
buff
upon
receiving
one
stack.
When
you
die,
you
lose
this
buff.
The
snowball
items
and
their
buffs
are:
Leviathan
-
Leviathan
Armor
(item
was
removed)
Mejai's
Soulstealer
-
Soul
Engourgement
Sword
of
the
Occult
-
Blood
Tribute
Exceptional
Snowball
Items
With
patch
V1.0.0.145
,
the
snowball
item
Bonetooth
Necklace
has
been
added,
which
is
available
exclusively
to
the
champion
Rengar,
the
Pridestalker
who
has
been
added
in
the
same
patch.
The
item
differs
from
the
above
mentioned
snowball
items
in
the
following
manners:
Upon
obtaining
charges,
the
icon
of
the
item
changes.
Instead
of
giving
one
bonus
that
increases
or
decreases
with
stacks,
the
item
grants
several
different
bonuses
depending
on
the
number
of
stacks
Rengar
has.
He
does
not
get
a
bonus
for
every
charge
but
for
every
threshhold
of
charges
he
achieves.
The
threshholds
are
3,
6,
9
and
14
charges.
Cost
efficiency
While
snowball
items
grant
comparably
low
base
stats
(especially
compared
to
their
gold
prices),
a
fully
stacked
snowball
item
grants
stats
that
exceed
most
other
items
in
the
game,
let
alone
within
their
gold
price
range.
Mejai's
Soulstealer
,
for
example,
grants
only
20
ability
power
at
the
cost
of
1235
gold
if
the
champion
has
not
collected
any
stacks
yet.
At
20
stacks,
however,
it
grants
a
total
of
180
ability
power
as
well
as
15%
cooldown
reduction
,
surpassing
Rabadon's
Deathcap
which
costs
3300
gold,
with
any
amount
of
stacks
higher
than
17.
From
a
cost
efficiency
perspective,
Mejai's
Soulstealer
breaks
even
at
6
stacks
(18.16
gold
per
point
of
AP)
and
Sword
of
the
Occult
breaks
even
at
5
stacks
(34.28
gold
per
point
of
AD).
Semi-snowball
items
Since
they
use
a
similar
stacking
mechanic,
The
Bloodthirster
can
be
referred
to
as
a
snowball
item
as
well.
However,
the
stacking
effect
works
very
differently.
Instead
of
stacking
only
on
kills
and
assists,
The
Bloodthirster
also
stacks
on
minion
kills,
enabling
a
champion
with
the
item
to
fill
it
by
simply
killing
minions
and
monsters
before
a
fight.
Only
half
of
these
stacks
are
lost
upon
champion
death,
so
champions
with
this
item
often
go
after
farm
upon
respawning.
More
generally,
snowballing
through
item
advantage
usually
refers
to
building
an
item
earlier
than
usual
or
purchasing
an
item
that
one
would
not
normally
be
able
to
get.
Countering
As
soon
as
you
realise
that
an
enemy
champion
is
getting
a
snowball
item,
it
is
essential
to
keep
them
from
gaining
stacks
and
kill
them
as
quickly
and
as
often
as
possible;
they
should
be
your
highest
priority
in
fights.
Keep
in
mind
that
each
assist
grants
one
stack
as
well,
making
team
fights
very
attractive
for
snowballing
champions.
Also
keep
in
mind
that,
after
a
snowballing
champion
is
killed,
assists
will
still
grant
them
stacks
even
after
death.
This
makes
it
considerable
to
sometimes
kill
them
last
in
order
to
drain
the
most
stacks
from
them.
In
the
case
of
The
Bloodthirster
,
it
would
be
wise
to
attempt
to
catch
a
champion
farming
while
he
tries
to
regain
his
stacks,
since
farming
is
usually
done
alone,
and
they
won't
have
as
much
lifesteal
as
they
did
before
death.
