[1]
In
Japanese
is
it
pronounced
as
"Ri
Sei"
(Ree-say).

to
the

protest
against
the

Dragon
Fist
Lee
Sin
(Lunar

skin
is
a
tribute
to
Bruce
Lee,
the
famed
martial
artist/actor
of
1970's
action
movies.
The
skin
seems
to
be
specifically
referencing
his
trademark
look
first
seen
in

the
Dragon.
Dragon
Fist
Lee
Sin's
idle
animation
are
Bruce
Lee's
mannerisms

which
literally
means
"plum",
and
with
it
being
a
common
Chinese
surname.
