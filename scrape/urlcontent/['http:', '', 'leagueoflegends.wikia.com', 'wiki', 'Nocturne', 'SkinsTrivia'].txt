Trivia
Nocturne
was
designed
by
Ezreal
.
Nocturne
is
voiced
by
Jason
Wishnov.
"Nocturne"
is
a
Latin
word
derived
from
"nox,
noctis"
meaning
"night"
and
"nocturnus/a/um"
meaning
"nightly".
In
French,
a
nocturne
is
usually
a
musical
composition
that
is
inspired
by,
or
evocative
of,
the
night.
Historically,
nocturne
is
a
very
old
term
applied
to
Night
Offices
and,
since
the
Mid
Ages,
to
divisions
in
the
canonical
hour
of
Matins.
In
French,
nocturne
is
also
an
adjective
to
describe
living
entities
who
are
active
at
night.
Umbra,
the
Latin
word
for
"shadow",
is
the
darkest
part
of
the
shadow,
where
the
light
source
is
completely
blocked
by
the
occluding
body.
An
observer
in
the
umbra
experiences
a
total
eclipse.
Nocturne
was
the
first
champion
to
be
previewed
on
a
popular
event
prior
to
its
release,
namely
at
the
PAX
East
2011
.
He
was
also
given
a
small
sneak
peek
on
the
website
IGN
before
release.
Nocturne's
ultimate
Paranoia
was
the
name
of
Fiddlesticks'
original
passive,
which
caused
enemies
nearby
to
miss
their
attacks.
Nocturne
along
with
Fiddlesticks'
are
the
only
champions
that
were
featured
in
two
special
login
screens.
One
being
the
2011
harrowing
event,
where
the
login
screen
was
Nocturne
in
his
Haunting
skin,
and
when
his
legendary
skin
was
released,
Eternum
Nocturne.
(5
dec.)
Nocturne's
lore
might
be
connected
with
Zed
,
several
speculations
about
the
two
champions
relationship
were
made
on
Reddit
upon
the
strong
resemblance
of
Nocturne's
2013
splash
art
with
ShockBlade
Zed
skin
and
other
common
elements
shared
by
the
two
characters.
Quotes
Nocturne's
quote:
"
Afraid
of
the
dark?
"
is
similar
to
Cho'Gath's
quote:
"
Afraid
of
the
dark?
Wise...
".
Nocturne's
quote:
"
Embrace
the
darkness!
"
might
be
a
reference
to
The
Darkness
game.
Nocturne's
joke:
"
Weather
forecast
for
tonight:
dark,
with
a
chance
of
pain!
"
might
be
a
reference
to
a
George
Carlin
routine,
"Al
Sleet,
the
Hippy-Dippy
Weatherman".
Eternum
Nocturne
joke
"
We
have
learned
of
spin
to
win,
None
can
stop...
it's
a
trick!"
Is
a
reference
to
the
popular
League
of
Legends
meme
"Spin
to
Win"
Graves's
Smokescreen
interacts
with
Nocturne.
If
an
enemy
Nocturne
is
hit
by
Smokescreen
,
Graves
will
say
"I've
got
your
darkness"
or
"Who's
in
the
dark
now?"
.
This
was
the
first
example
of
unique
dialogue
triggered
by
interactions
between
champions.
Skins
Eternum
Nocturne
skin
teaser
[1]
Three
of
Nocturne's
skins
changes
the
particle
of
his
Duskbringer
and
Unspeakable
Horror
:
Frozen
Terror
Nocturne
changes
the
particles
of
his
Duskbringer
and
Unspeakable
Horror
abilities
to
light
blue
instead
of
the
original's
black.
Haunting
Nocturne
had
its
Duskbringer
and
Unspeakable
Horror
ability
particles
changed
from
the
original's
black
to
slime
green
after
a
petition
on
the
League
of
Legends
forum
by
players
as
seen
here
.
Eternum
Nocturne
changes
the
particles
of
his
Duskbringer
,
Unspeakable
Horror
,
Paranoia
to
a
red
colour
instead
of
the
original's
black.
Also
Shroud
of
Darkness
particle
changes
to
a
cleaner,
bigger
spell
shield
that
resembles
more
Spell
Shield
than
the
classic
version
of
this
one.
Haunting
Nocturne's
art
was
used
for
the
log
in
screen
during
The
Harrowing
of
2011.
Eternum
Nocturne's
spell
effects
are
similar
to
that
of
the
Battlecast
skins'
effects.
Eternum
Nocturne's
voice
and
demeanor
are
similar
to
Harbinger
from
the
Mass
Effect
series.
More
specifically,
several
of
his
quotes
are
similar
to
lines
from
the
Reapers
Sovereign
and
Harbinger
,
including:
"Their
existence
is
a
mistake.
"
resembling
Sovereign's
"
Organic
life
is
nothing
but
a
genetic
mutation,
an
accident.
"
"
We
transcend
time.
"
and
"
What
was,
is,
and
will
forever
be.
"
resembling
Sovereign's
"
We
have
no
beginning.
We
have
no
end.
We
are
infinite
."
"
Fate
cannot
be
averted.
"
resembling
Harbinger's
"
You
cannot
escape
your
destiny
".
"
The
end
of
days
draws
near.
"
somewhat
resembling
Sovereign's
"
The
time
of
our
return
is
coming
."
"
We
are
one."
resembling
Harbinger's
"
We
fight
as
one.
"
and
Sovereign's
"
We
are
legion.
