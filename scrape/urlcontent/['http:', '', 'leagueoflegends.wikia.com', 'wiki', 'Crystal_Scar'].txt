Kalamanda
“What
do
you
think
would
have
happened
if
the
League
hadn’t
stopped
Demacia
and
Noxus
in
Kalamanda?
I
can
sum
it
up
in
four
words:
the
sixth
Rune
War.”
–-
Ryze,
the
Rogue
Mage
The
League
of
Legends
,
in
its
21
years
of
existence,
never
had
its
mandate
of
keeping
the
peace
between
Valoran's
city-states
put
to
a
serious
test.
All
of
the
political
disagreements
that
the
city-states
could
muster
had
been
resolved
securely
on
the
Fields
of
Justice.
Never
before
was
the
League
forced
to
intervene
in
any
dispute.
That
is,
until
Kalamanda.
The
conflict
between
Demacia
and
Noxus
in
Kalamanda,
a
village
nestled
within
the
Great
Barrier’s
Odyn
Valley,
would
provoke
the
League’s
first
show
of
force.
It
all
began
when
a
treasure
trove
of
natural
resources
was
discovered
there.
The
city-states
flocked
in,
each
hoping
to
secure
the
lion’s
share
of
that
treasure
for
itself.
Enormous
profits
were
turned
from
mining
the
vast
crystal
deposits,
and
with
the
added
strikes
of
enchantable
gold
and
rare
gems,
the
city-states
thrived
from
their
newfound
riches.
This
time
of
prosperity
was
short-lived,
as
the
temptation
to
seize
full
control
of
the
mines
proved
too
difficult
for
the
city-states
to
resist.
In
a
period
of
months,
Kalamanda
was
transformed
from
a
sleepy
mountain
village
to
a
stage
for
open
war
between
two
ancient
and
powerful
foes.
Demacia
and
Noxus
came
to
blows
for
control
of
the
village,
triggered
by
the
assassination
of
Noxus’
longtime
leader,
General
Boram
Darkwill.
The
battle
raged
on
despite
severe
warnings,
and
the
League
was
forced
to
resort
to
a
terrifying
show
of
power.
A
temporal
stasis
field
was
summoned
over
the
entire
village,
trapping
inhabitants
and
combatants
alike.
Time
magic
on
such
a
scale
had
not
been
seen
since
the
Rune
Wars.
None
of
Valoran’s
city-states
had
the
slightest
inkling
that
the
League
preserved
such
secrets,
let
alone
possessed
the
will
to
use
them.
While
removing
the
trapped
people
from
the
village,
the
League
found
that
the
use
of
such
powerful
magic
had
rendered
Kalamanda
completely
uninhabitable.
After
the
stasis
field
was
removed,
Kalamanda
was
transformed
into
the
newest
Field
of
Justice,
the
“Crystal
Scar”.
It
stands
as
a
chilling
reminder
of
the
destructive
consequences
of
magic
to
Runeterra,
and
the
lengths
to
which
the
League
will
go
in
order
to
enforce
the
peace
in
Valoran.
Timeline
13
July,
20
CLE
(Common
League
Era)
–
Mayor
Anson
Ridley
reports
discovery
of
precious
mineral
deposits
and
two
nexuses
within
the
village
of
Kalamanda.
The
League
and
all
major
city-states
send
representatives
for
research
and
mining
purposes.
25
January,
21
CLE
–
An
earthquake
causes
the
collapse
of
Demacia’s
#1
Loadstone
Mining
Consortium.
The
trapped
Demacian
miners
are
rescued
a
month
later
and
the
body
of
a
Noxian
soldier
surrounded
by
arcano-charges
is
discovered
nearby,
suggesting
Noxian
sabotage.
24
February,
21
CLE
–
Before
the
investigation
surrounding
Noxian
sabotage
is
complete,
the
Kalamanda
Village
Council
grants
an
exclusive
mining
contract
to
Demacia,
making
Kalamanda
a
province
of
Demacia.
Noxus
refuses
to
vacate
the
village,
claiming
that
they
were
falsely
accused.
1
July,
21
CLE
–
The
leader
of
the
Noxian
High
Command,
General
Boram
Darkwill,
is
assassinated
while
on
the
road
to
Kalamanda.
Open
warfare
erupts
throughout
the
village
between
Demacian
and
Noxian
military
forces.
The
League’s
Council
of
Equity
demands
that
all
hostilities
stop
within
24
hours
or
“face
dire
and
lasting
consequences”.
29
July,
21
CLE
–
The
League
summons
a
temporal
field
over
the
village,
freezing
everyone
and
everything
inside
it
in
time.
All
fighting
instantly
ceases.
Valoran
is
in
shock,
as
no
one
believed
the
League
possessed
such
might,
let
alone
the
will
to
use
it.
3
August,
21
CLE
–
The
League
releases
the
temporal
field
that
had
engulfed
the
village
and
claims
it
permanently
as
League
territory.
The
village
is
transformed
into
the
League’s
newest
Field
of
Justice,
“Crystal
Scar”.
Ancient
creature
awakens
For
ages,
A
race
commonly
known
as
the
Brackern
has
slept
below
the
grounds
near
Kalamanda.
The
brackern
were
unusual
beings
blessed
with
the
earth's
primal
magic,
embodied
in
the
form
of
crystals.
Their
kind
knew
of
an
arcane
ritual
to
bind
their
life's
essence
to
a
crystal,
communing
with
the
magic
embedded
in
it.
A
vicious
battle
was
fought
near
the
Odyn
Valley
and
unleashes
a
chaotic
magic
that
poisoned
the
crystals.
To
avoid
extinction,
The
brackerns
only
course
was
to
hibernate
underground
until
the
wars
stopped.
The
strongest,
most
intelligent
brackern
hibernated
closer
to
the
surface
to
awaken
first
and
assess
the
world's
condition
for
the
return
of
their
race.
The
recent
mining
operations
and
violent
escalation
in
Kalamanda
were
enough
to
awaken
Skarner
the
Crystal
Vanguard
.
He
lashes
out
in
anger
and
confusion.
Reason
eventually
won
out
over
his
anger
when
he
realized
that
the
agents
of
the
League
who
found
him
were
simply
functionaries.
For
now,
there
is
a
place
where
Skarner
can
use
his
power
to
change
the
world
into
one
to
which
his
kind
could
eventually
return:
the
League
of
Legends.
Gameplay
Map
of
the
Crystal
Scar.
Unlike
other
maps,
the
Crystal
Scar
features
a
capture-and-hold
style
of
gameplay.
This
new
League
of
Legends
experience
is
called
Dominion
.
Here
two
teams
of
five
players
battle
over
a
circular
map
and
fight
for
control
over
five
capture
points
in
an
effort
to
destroy
the
opposing
team’s
Nexus,
which
has
a
starting
health
of
500.
The
team
that
has
captured
more
points
than
the
other
begin
to
deal
damage
to
the
opposing
enemy
nexus
until
its
health
reaches
0.
This
gameplay
is
designed
to
be
fluid,
with
both
teams
constantly
seizing
the
advantage
from
one
another.
Features
The
outer
ring
of
the
Crystal
Scar
is
approximately
28,000
units
around,
taking
about
80
seconds
for
the
average
champion
to
run
around
without
any
boots
.
Capture
Points
Main
article:
Capture
Point
Capture
points
represent
important
strategic
locations
across
the
map.
Controlling
these
points
and
defending
them
against
the
opposition
is
the
central
focus
of
Dominion.
These
locations
are:
Master
Yi
attempting
to
capture
the
Quarry
The
Windmill
,
located
in
the
northern
part
of
Kalamanda.
The
Drill
,
located
in
Kalamanda’s
northeastern
section.
The
Boneyard
,
located
in
the
southeastern
section.
The
Quarry,
in
the
southwestern
section.
The
Refinery
,
located
in
the
northwestern
section.
Buffs
Main
article:
Buff
In
the
crystal
scar
there
are
several
fixed
position
buffs
that
are
placed
in
strategic
locations
on
the
map
and
come
in
three
different
forms:
Nidalee
obtaining
The
Greater
Relic
Greater
Relic
The
Greater
Relic
grants
two
powerful,
short
duration
combat
buffs,
Storm
Shield
Shield
and
Storm
Shield
Lightning
,
giving
an
absorption
shield
and
a
damaging
nuke
(that
attacks
and
spellcasts
proc)
to
any
one
teammate.
There
is
one
relic
for
each
team
and
are
team-specific.
Positioned
right
next
to
each
other
the
relics
are
located
at
the
very
center
of
the
Crystal
Scar.
Speed
Shrines
Nidalee
running
through
a
Speed
Shrine
The
Speed
Shrines
are
three
areas
on
the
map
that
grant
a
significant,
yet
short
duration,
movement
speed
bonus
to
any
champion
that
passes
through
them.
These
relics
are
located
in
a
triangle
around
the
seal.
Health
Relics
The
Health
Relics
are
placed
in
ten
areas
on
the
map
that
grant
a
replenishment
of
health
and
mana
for
the
champion
that
walks
over
it.
A
health
relic
is
located
behind
every
capture
point
and
the
rest
are
positioned
around
the
seal
(ten
total).
Items
Due
to
the
different
pace
of
the
game,
Dominion
offers
new
items
available
only
on
the
Crystal
Scar
and
also
prohibits
other
items
to
maintain
balance.
Each
champion
is
also
provided
with
a
set
of
recommended
items
specially
for
Dominion
mode.
The
Crystal
Scar
Shop
Replaced
items
Many
Summoner's
Rift
items
are
replaced
with
other
items
to
maintain
balance.
For
instance,
the
Prospector
items
replace
the
Doran
items
with
double
the
stats
and
a
passive
that
adds
health,
but
is
unique
to
prevent
stacking.
They
are
a
variation
of
the
original
item,
but
remains
beneficial
to
the
fast-paced
game
style
that
is
Dominion.
Many
of
the
replacing
items
are
also
used
on
other
maps
to
maintain
balance
as
well.
