Zed
is
the
first
ninja
in
200
years
to
unlock
the
ancient,
forbidden
ways.
He
defied
his
clan
and
master,
casting
off
the
balance
and
discipline
that
had
shackled
him
all
his
life.
Zed
now
offers
power
to
those
who
embrace
knowledge
of
the
shadows,
and
slays
those
who
cling
to
ignorance.
An
orphan,
Zed
was
taken
in
and
trained
by
a
great
ninja
master.
Only
one
other
student
appeared
to
be
Zed's
equal
-
the
master's
son,
Shen
.
It
seemed
Zed
could
never
win
the
favor
of
the
master,
as
every
match
between
the
rivals
ended
in
a
draw.
Frustrated
and
jealous,
he
sought
an
advantage.
The
young
ninja
ventured
into
a
sealed
part
of
the
clan's
temple,
where
he
found
an
ornate,
foreboding
box.
Sensing
the
dark
knowledge
within,
Zed
knew
he
should
not
open
it,
but
he
peered
inside
nonetheless.
In
an
instant,
shadows
touched
his
mind,
revealing
techniques
that
had
long
been
hidden.
Now
armed
with
a
secret
edge,
he
challenged
Shen,
and
this
time
he
defeated
the
master's
son.
He
expected
praise
and
recognition
in
his
moment
of
victory,
but
somehow
the
master
knew
Zed
had
used
forbidden
ways,
and
banished
him.
Humiliated,
the
young
ninja
wandered
for
years.
His
bitterness
turned
to
ambition,
and
he
began
to
train
others
in
the
style
of
the
shadows.
As
his
power
grew,
so
did
his
circle
of
followers,
but
he
knew
that
without
the
box,
his
technique
would
never
be
perfect.
One
day,
Zed
looked
at
his
followers
and
saw
that
his
students
were
now
an
army.
He
led
them
back
to
the
temple
to
claim
his
prize.
At
the
gates,
he
was
surprised
to
find
the
old
master
waiting,
receiving
Zed
and
his
disciples
as
if
they
were
welcome
guests.
The
old
man
laid
his
sword
at
Zed's
feet,
declaring
that
he
had
failed
Zed
as
his
master.
By
banishing
his
former
student,
the
master
had
doomed
Zed
to
the
shadows,
instead
of
leading
him
to
the
balanced
path.
The
old
man
implored
Zed
to
enter
the
temple,
destroy
the
box,
and
lead
his
followers
to
balance.
The
dark
ninja
followed
the
master
inside.
Moments
later,
the
assembled
ninjas
heard
Zed
cry
out
in
pain.
Mysteriously,
he
emerged
unscathed,
and
threw
the
severed
head
of
the
master
at
Shen's
feet.
Screaming
in
rage,
Zed
commanded
his
followers
to
slaughter
the
master's
students
and
seize
the
box.
That
day,
the
old
ninja
order
fell.
Though
many
students
died,
some
escaped
thanks
to
Shen's
heroic
efforts.
Now
the
temple
is
a
dark
training
ground
for
the
Order
of
the
Shadow.
Zed
rules
as
the
Order's
master,
and
his
edict
is
simple:
perfect
one's
technique,
and
kill
all
ninjas
who
refuse
to
embrace
the
shadows.
"Balance
is
a
lie
-
we
are
the
true
ninjas."

Sneak
Peek
Announcement
made

Zed
sneak
peek
artwork
Since
early
antiquity,
shadows
have
long
been
a
subject
of
fascination.
If
you're
a
scientist,
your
shadow
is
probably
a
simple
projection
of
light.
If
you're
more
spiritual,
your
shadow
might
be
a
reflection
of
your
more
shady
whims.
And
if
you’re
following
a
forbidden
path
filled
with
dark
techniques
and
even
darker
motives,
it's
possible
that
your
shadow
is
a
sinister
companion
ready
to
help
you
pull
off
a
vicious
assassination
in
some
dark
corner
of
the
Fields
of
Justice.
While
we're
delving
into
the
forbidden
ways,
allow
us
to
introduce
Zed,
a
relentless
ninja
master
who'll
leave
your
enemies
scared
of
their
own
shadows.
Zed,
the
Master
of
Shadows
Revealed
Announcement

A
forbidden
new
champion
stalks
the
Fields
of
Justice
in
the
upcoming
patch:
Zed,
the
Master
of
Shadows.
Deadly
in
many
roles,
including
mid
lane
and
jungle,
this
dark
assassin's
energy-based
gameplay
revolves
around
conjuring
and
commanding
shadow
clones.
Unlike
other
champions
with
illusions,
Zed's
shadow
clone
is
the
lynchpin
in
his
kit.
With
a
shadow
clone
active,
Zed's
abilities
are
duplicated,
allowing
him
to
deal
more
damage,
apply
additional
effects,
or
even
engage
an
enemy
from
an
unexpected
angle.
Zed
can
even
switch
places
with
his
clones
to
perform
surprise
initiations
or
quickly
head
off
a
fleeing
enemy.
This
ability
to
strategically
reposition
combined
with
some
hefty
bursts
of
both
physical
and
magic
damage
to
make
Zed
versatile
across
multiple
roles.
When
playing
Zed
in
lane,
Razor
Shuriken
can
both
harass
the
enemy
and
rapidly
clear
minions,
making
him
a
powerful
bully.
Spamming
Razor
Shuriken
allows
Zed
to
shove
the
lane
and
keep
pressure
up,
buy
time
to
roam,
or
stifle
a
push
to
drive
enemies
off
his
tower.
Meanwhile,
using
Living
Shadow
to
set
up
creative
angles
on
your
lane
opponent
can
complicate
juke
attempts
and
allow
you
to
land
full
damage
nukes.
Zed's
ganking
and
pursuit
power
also
makes
him
an
ideal
jungler.
Switching
places
with
your
shadow
clone
via
Living
Shadow
creates
opportunities
for
lightning-fast
initiations,
escapes,
and
even
buff
steals.
The
powerful
slow
from
a
cloned
Shadow
Slash
can
also
lock
down
an
enemy
champion,
leaving
him
vulnerable
to
execution
from
a
heavy
hitting
attack
charged
with
Contempt
for
the
Weak.
Once
the
team
fights
start,
Zed's
clone
enables
him
to
alternately
deploy
his
abilities
from
a
safe
distance
or
deal
even
more
damage
when
he
charges
into
the
fray.
He
can
also
combine
Living
Shadow
with
Shadow
Slash
to
blanket
an
area
with
a
high-intensity
slow,
throwing
off
enemy
positioning.
Finally,
Death
Mark
is
an
excellent
cleanup
ability
to
chase
down
and
finish
off
fleeing
low-health
champions.
The
bonus
magic
damage
from
Contempt
for
the
Weak
is
a
great
way
to
top
off
Death
Mark's
detonation
damage
for
surefire
killing
blows.
Managing
this
clone-and-combo
kit
is
crucial
to
dominating
with
Zed.
Strategically
positioning
Zed
and
his
clone
for
a
two-pronged
assault
before
deploying
your
skillshots
will
ultimately
make
or
break
your
success
on
the
Fields
of
Justice.

V1.0.0.151
:
Added
Contempt
for
the
Weak
(Innate)
Whenever
Zed
attacks
an
enemy
below
50%
Health,
he
deals
an
additional
8%
of
their
maximum
Health
as
magic
damage.
This
effect
has
a
short
cooldown.
Razor
Shuriken
(Q)
Zed
and
his
shadow
both
throw
their
shurikens,
dealing
physical
damage
to
any
target
they
pass
through.
Each
Shuriken
deals
less
damage
to
targets
beyond
the
first.
Living
Shadow
:
(W)
Passive:
Increases
Zed's
bonus
attack
damage
by
a
percentage.
Active:
Zed's
shadow
dashes
forward,
remaining
in
place
for
a
short
duration.
Zed's
shadow
will
duplicate
his
spells.
Activating
Living
Shadow
again
while
his
shadow
is
active
will
cause
Zed
to
switch
positions
with
his
shadow.
If
both
Zed
and
his
shadow
strike
the
same
target
with
Razor
Shurikens
or
Shadow
Slash,
Zed
re-gains
some
energy
and
the
target
suffers
an
additional
effect:
Razor
Shurikens
deal
additional
bonus
damage
and
the
slow
from
Shadow
Slash
is
dramatically
increased.
Shadow
Slash
(E)
Zed
and
his
shadow
both
create
a
burst
of
shadow,
dealing
physical
damage
to
nearby
enemies.
Zed's
Shadow
Slash
slightly
reduces
the
cooldown
of
Living
Shadow
by
for
each
unit
struck.
The
shadow's
Shadow
Slash
briefly
slows
enemies.
Death
Mark
(Ultimate)
Zed
sinks
into
the
shadows
and
dashes
to
his
target,
dealing
physical
damage.
He
also
spawns
a
Living
Shadow
beyond
the
target,
which
duplicates
his
spells
and
marks
the
target.
After
3
seconds,
the
mark
will
detonate,
dealing
physical
damage
based
on
the
damage
dealt
to
the
target
by
Zed
and
his
shadow
while
the
mark
was
active.
Zed
can
reactivate
this
ability
to
switch
positions
with
this
shadow.
