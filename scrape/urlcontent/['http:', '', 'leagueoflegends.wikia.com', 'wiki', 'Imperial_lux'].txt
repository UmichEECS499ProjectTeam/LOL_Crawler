Trivia
Lux
was
designed
by
Shurelia
.
Lux
has
an
unusual
Champion
Spotlight
:
Shurelia
herself
explains
how
Lux
and
her
abilities
works
as
well
as
giving
out
pointers.
"Lux"
is
the
Latin
word
for
"light".
It
is
also
the
SI
unit
of
luminance
and
luminous
emittance
per
unit.
One
of
her
abilites
was
named
Luminance
Fräulein
before.
("Fraeulein"
(or
Fräulein)
means
"young
woman"
in
German.)
[2]
Lux
is
the
third
champion
,
after
Katarina
and
Ezreal
,
to
be
announced
and
then
have
her
model
re-imagined
before
it
went
live.
The
redesigned
model
is
based
off
of
a
painting
by
Katertot.
[3]
"Katertot"
is
the
forum
nickname
of
Katie
DeSousa,
who
was
hired
by
Riot
as
an
artist
shortly
after
she
submitted
the
fan
rework
of
Lux's
image.
[1]
Lux's
design,
along
with
her
ultimate,
her
joke,
and
her
skins
draw
heavy
inspiration
from
Marisa
Kirisame
,
the
Ordinary
Magician,
of
Touhou
Project
.
Lux's
joke
about
being
an
ordinary
mage
corresponds
with
Touhou
7
(Perfect
Cherry
Blossom),
where
Marisa
says
"Me?
No,
I'm
just
an
ordinary
magician"
when
accused
of
being
a
light
magician.
Lux's
penchant
for
mimicking
spells
on
sight
described
in
the
lore
is
similar
to
Marisa's
tendency
to
steal
moves
from
other
characters
as
well.
Lux's
ultimate
Final
Spark
was
originally
named
Finales
Funkeln
,
which
is
German
and
translates
to
"Final
Sparkle".
It
had
been
renamed
Infinite
Light
in
V1.0.0.144
.
Due
to
community
demand,
the
ability
was
again
renamed
to
Final
Spark
in
V1.0.0.145
.
Both
the
former
and
the
current
name
is
a
reference
to
Marisa
Kirisame's
upgraded
spellcard
called
Final
Spark
.
This
ability
also
bears
close
resemblance
to
Final
Flash,
an
ability
used
by
Vegeta
in
Dragonball
Z.
They
both
begin
charging
this
ability
with
their
arms
pointing
out
to
the
side,
and
finish
it
with
their
arms
pointing
forward.
The
names
and
shapes
of
the
abilities
are
also
similar.
Lux
was
announced
in
the
Journal
of
Justice:
Volume
1,
Issue
06
prior
to
her
official
announcement.
Lux
and
Swain
used
to
have
the
most
amount
of
jokes,
both
at
4.
Until
getting
surpassed
by
Vi
who
has
5.
After
Garen
received
his
VU,
he
surpassed
all
champions
with
a
grand
total
of
6.
Lux
has
the
lowest
Base
Health
out
of
all
Champions,
345
HP
with
+79
growth.
Quotes
Lux's
taunt
about
power
levels
is
a
reference
to
the
manga/anime
Dragon
Ball
Z
.
Lux's
taunt
"In
the
name
of
Demacia,
I
will
punish
you!"
,
is
a
reference
to
the
manga/anime
Sailor
Moon
.
Lux's
movement
quote
"I
love
it
when
a
plan
comes
together"
is
a
reference
to
the
A-Team's
Colonel
Hannibal
Smith's
favorite
catchphrase.
Lux's
joke
"Double
rainbow?
What
does
it
mean...?"
and
the
follow
up
joke
"Well,
a
'double
rainbow'..."
is
a
reference
to
a
well-known
YouTube
video
where
a
man
severely
overreacts
to
seeing
a
double
rainbow.
[2]
In
the
Polish
client,
Lux's
joke
"Light?
I
carry
it
in
myself."
is
a
reference
to
a
line
from
a
Polish
song
"Light,
you
carry
it
in
yourself"
and
is
sung
in
the
same
melody.
The
quote
"Shhh!
I'm
charging
my
laser..."
is
a
reference
to
the
Shoop
Da
Whoop
meme.
Skins
The
splash
art
for
Sorceress
Lux
resembles
the
character
Marisa
Kirisame
from
the
Touhou
Project
,
when
Marisa
is
shown
in
her
navy-blue
dress
and
riding
a
broom
(or
a
vine)
in
memorable
versions.
Also
in
the
splash
art
of
the
Sorceress
skin,
Lux
is
in
front
of
a
full-moon,
likely
a
reference
to
Touhou
8
(Imperishable
Night),
the
first
game
in
the
series
to
have
clearly
depicted
Marisa
on
a
broom,
where
the
story
revolved
around
retrieving
stolen
full-moon.
Also,
since
Touhou
7.5
(Immaterial
and
Missing
Power),
despite
being
chronoligally
first,
was
released
after
Touhou
8,
the
latter
is
the
first
released
game
of
the
series
featuring
Marisa's
Final
Spark
spellcard.
Spellthief
Lux
is
another
reference
to
Marisa
Kirisame,
who
also
steals
spells.
This
is
also
a
reference
to
the
Rylai
Crestfal
from
Dota,
who
was
initially
supposed
to
be
kind
of
a
spellthief,
that
would
look
that
way.
Imperial
Lux
is
likely
a
homage
to
the
Star
Wars
universe;
bearing
a
strong
similarity
to
Admiral
Dodonna
of
the
Old
Republic.
Imperial
Lux
is
often
compared
to
the
visual
look
of
Street
Fighter's
M.
Bison
who
has
a
fairly
similar
appearance.
Commando
Lux
possibly
is
a
reference
to
the
Imperial
Guard
of
the
Warhammer
40,000
series.
At
the
left
side
of
Steel
Legion
Lux
splash's
background,
it
shows
furnance(s)
similar
to
those
of
the
Emberworks
,
a
dungeon
from
the
game
Torchlight
II
.
Relations
Stolen
image
of
the
couple
Lux
is
Garen
's
younger
sister.
One
of
the
Howling
Abyss
shopkeepers,
Lyte,
hints
that
Ezreal
has
a
secret
relationship
with
Lux.
A
Zaun
Lab
Bot
had
apparently
stolen
an
image
of
the
couple
from
Ezreal
and
has
made
it
public.
[4]
Lux
and
Ezreal
are
listed
as
friends
on
the
new
League
of
Legends
website.
Acording
to
the
new
League
of
Legends
webpage,
Lux
is
listed
as
Fiora
's
rival.
