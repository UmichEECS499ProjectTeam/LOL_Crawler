Background
"When
the
sun
is
at
its
peak,
the
pool
blends
in
with
the
shimmering
heat,
looking
as
it
its
waters
run
off
into
infinity."
Only
the
boldest
of
men
and
women
dare
take
the
risky
trip
to
the
hottest
spot
in
Valoran
,
in
the
very
center
of
the
Shurima
Desert
.
Those
who
successfully
make
the
journey
may
bathe
their
swords
in
a
magical
pool
of
the
purest
water
known
to
this
world.
Any
edge
dipped
into
this
pool
will
stay
sharper
and
strike
truer
than
any
other
sword.
Trivia
Infinity
Edge
shares
its
name
with
a
set
of
Infinity
Weapons
from
the
game
Lineage
II
,
which
are
the
strongest
weapons
available.
Infinity
Edge
bears
similarities
to
the
Infinity
Shaper.
Infinity
Edge
is
tied
with
Lord
Van
Damm's
Pillager
for
the
most
expensive
item
in
the
game.
