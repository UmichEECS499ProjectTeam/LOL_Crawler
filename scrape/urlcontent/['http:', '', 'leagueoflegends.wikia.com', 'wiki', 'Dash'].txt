Dash
is
a
type
of
champion
ability
that
causes
the
user
to
move
to
a
destination
at
an
increased
speed.
Skillshots
can
hit
the
champion
mid-way
through
the
dash.
Some
dashes
can
be
used
to
pass
through
walls.
Blinks
are
similar
to
dashes,
but
they
are
instantaneous;
as
such,
they
can't
be
hit
mid-travel.

Strategy
A
dash
spell
can
be
used
for
offensive
or
for
escaping
purposes.
For
offensive
purposes,
it's
best
used
for
either
initiation
or
for
finishing
blows.
Strategy
of
a
dash
spell
is
dependable
on
the
champion's
attribute:
For
example,
Shen
can
use
his
dash
ability,
Shadow
Dash
,
to
initiate
the
battle,
or
Akali
can
use
her
dash
ability,
Shadow
Dance
,
to
secure
a
kill.
Types
There
are
five
types
of
dashes:
Line
dash
Ground
Targeted
dash
Single
Target
dash
Point
Blank
dash
Blink
Line
dashes
These
kinds
of
dashes
move
the
champion
in
a
straight
line
toward
the
targeted
location.

targeted
dashes
allow
a
champion
to
reach
the
location
of
a
target
in
range,
regardless
of
how
much
it
travels
after
the
dash
has
been
cast.
These
dashes
can
only
pass
through
walls
if
there
is
a
valid
target
on
the
other
side.
Targeted
dashes
will
not
affect
the
target
if
they
use
a
blink,
but
will
travel
with
the
target
if
they
use
a
dash.

of

Blink
Main
article:
Blink
These
abilities
target
a
point
or
area
and
teleport
the
champion
to
the
location,
usually
causing
an
effect
afterwards.
These
are
unique
from
the
dash
abilities
listed
above
because
they
avoid
all
hazards
between
the
points
and
are
therefore
not
affected
by
them.
For
example,
Akali
gets
stunned
when
using
Shadow
Dance
through
Veigar's
Event
Horizon
but
Kassadin
can
Riftwalk
past
with
impunity.
