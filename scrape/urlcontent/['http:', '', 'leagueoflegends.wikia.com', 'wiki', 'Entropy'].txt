Notes
The
active
effect
on
Entropy
is
the
only
active
effect
on
any
item
that
procs
the
bonus
damage
from
Sheen
,
Trinity
Force
,
and
Lich
Bane
.
Strategy
Entropy
is
designed
for
a
front-line
fighter
to
stick
to
his
target
on
the
smaller
maps,
where
short-range
dashes
and
blinks
are
very
strong.
The
active
effect
deals
damage
over
time,
which
can
secure
a
kill
on
an
enemy
with
an
escape.
Frozen
Mallet
is
an
alternate
Legendary
item
which
performs
a
similar
function.
It
has
less
damage
but
a
strong
slow
and
more
health,
making
it
better
on
melee
fighter
champions
who
need
more
health
to
survive
being
in
close-range
and
a
consistent
slow
to
lock
down
an
enemy.
Trivia
Entropy's
active
ability
is
intended
to
replicate
the
effects
of
Blessing
of
the
Lizard
Elder
,
which
is
not
available
in
Dominion
.
Veigar's
innate
ability
was
originally
called
"Entropy"
until
it
was
replaced
to
Equilibrium
.
Until
season
three,
Entropy
was
the
only
item
that
granted
the
user
deal
true
damage
.
It
remains
one
of
two
items,
along
with
Spirit
of
the
Elder
Lizard
.
