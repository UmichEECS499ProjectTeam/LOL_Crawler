Trivia
Alistar
was
designed
by
Guinsoo
.
Alistar
is
voiced
by
Harlan
Hogan
.
The
word
alistar
in
old
English
means
"protector".
The
icon
for
Triumphant
Roar
is
used
to
show
the
stun
debuff
for
some
abilities.
Alistar
is
featured
in
the
Summoner
spell
interface.
Quotes
Alistar's
quote
"Mess
with
the
bull
and
you
get
the
horns!"
may
be
a
reference
to
the
Breakfast
Club.
Said
by
principal
Richard
Vernon:
Don't
mess
with
the
bull,
young
man.
You'll
get
the
horns.
[1]
A
side-by-side
comparison
can
be
seen
here
.
Alistar
shares
a
quote
with
Sejuani
:
"Stampede!".
Skins
Black
Alistar
is
one
of
the
four
Collector's
Edition
skins,
the
other
skins
with
this
distinction
are
Goth
Annie
,
Silver
Kayle
and
Human
Ryze
.
It
could
only
be
obtained
by
pre-ordering
the
game.
Matador
Alistar
is
a
tribute
to
the
tale
of
Ferdinand
the
Bull
,
who
would
rather
smell
flowers
than
participate
in
bullfights.
Longhorn
Alistar
may
be
a
reference
to
the
series
Cowboys
of
Moo
Mesa
.
Golden
Alistar
,
Assassin
Master
Yi
,
and
White
Mage
Veigar
are
the
only
skins
priced
at
390
,
making
them
the
cheapest
available
skins
(excluding
sale
prices
and
free/promotional
skins).
Golden
Alistar
may
be
a
reference
to
the
Biblical
golden
calf
.
In
his
Chinese
artwork,
Alistar
has
four
fingers
despite
his
model
only
having
three.
It
also
shows
him
having
three
knuckles
(suggesting
four
fingers)
in
his
classic,
black
and
golden
artwork.
This
mistake
is
corrected
in
the
Matador
Alistar,
Unchained
Alistar,
Longhorn
Alistar
and
Chinese
Golden
Alistar
artworks.
In
his
Original
Splash
Arts,
some
show
him
with
4
fingers,
while
others
display
the
correct
3
fingers.
In
his
Chinese
Longhorn
Alistar
and
Classic
arts,
he
still
has
4
fingers.
There
was
originally
a
bug
that
the
Longhorn
Alistar
texture
would
all
turn
blue,
this
was
however
later
fixed.
Unchained
Alistar
skin
is
free
and
obtainable
by
visiting
the
Riotgamesinc
channel
on
Youtube
and
then
syncing
with
the
appropriate
LoL
website.
If
you
do
not
have
the
champion,
Alistar
will
be
given
to
you
for
free
along
with
the
said
skin.
Further
instructions
for
attaining
this
skin
can
be
reached
here:
Unchained
Alistar
Instructions
.
In
early
2012,
Alistar's
Classic
artwork
was
replaced
by
the
Chinese
Classic
skin
artwork,
as
well
as
those
of
Fiddlesticks
,
Galio
,
and
Malzahar
.
These
were
the
first
in
a
long
line
of
many
champions
to
get
new
artworks
on
future
patches.
However,
Alistar's
Classic
skin
artwork
is
recolored
a
bit.
Infernal
Alistar
shares
the
Infernal
theme
with
Infernal
Nasus
.
Relations
Both
Alistar
and
Xin
Zhao
had
been
captured
by
Noxus
and
have
participated
in
the
Fleshing.
When
Renekton
broke
into
the
Institute
of
War
,
Alistar
was
one
of
the
three
defenders
who
attempted
to
stop
Renekton
from
getting
to
his
brother,
Nasus
.
