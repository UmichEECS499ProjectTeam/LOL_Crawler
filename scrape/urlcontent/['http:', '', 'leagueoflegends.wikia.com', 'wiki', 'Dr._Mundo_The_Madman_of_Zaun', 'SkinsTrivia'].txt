Trivia
Mundo
was
designed
by
Fantasyworld
,
an
old
Designer
who
is
in
Business
now.
Mundo
is
voiced
by
J.S.
Gilbert,
Who
also
voices
Battlecast
Prime
Cho'Gath
,
Gragas
,
Sion
and
Udyr
.
Mundo
is
the
Spanish,
Filipino,
and
Portuguese
word
for
"world".
Dr.
Mundo
might
be
a
reference
to
"Mr.
Hyde",
the
abominated
alter
ego
of
Dr.
Henry
Jekyll
from
the
Van
Helsing
movie
and
the
video
game.
The
icons
for
Dr.
Mundo's
Burning
Agony
and
Masochism
skills
used
in
game
on
the
champion
info
screen
show
him
in
his
original
model,
which
was
used
in
the
early
closed
beta.
In
fact,
we
can
see
that
model
on
a
coffin
of
Voodoo
Shaman
in
Autumn
version
of
Summoner's
Rift
.
His
/dance
was
inspired
by
TV
series
House,
M.D.
,
from
this
episode
where
Dr.
House
dances
to
the
song
"
Fight
The
Power
".
[1]
A
side-by-side
comparison
be
be
seen
here
.
According
to
Rinoa,
Dr.
Mundo's
first
name
is
Edmundo,
named
after
an
artist
at
Riot.
[2]
Mundo
is
apparently
lactose
intolerant,
as
said
in
this
post.
Dr.
Mundo
is
one
of
the
five
champions
who
use
health
as
a
primary
resource
for
casting
spells.
The
other
four
champions
are
Aatrox
,
Mordekaiser
,
Vladimir
and
Zac
.
Of
these
five
champions,
Dr.
Mundo
is
the
only
one
to
have
any
associated
cost
to
use
his
ultimate
ability
(20%
of
his
current
health).
Quotes
Dr.
Mundo's
quote
"Mundo...mmm...*slurp*...smash!"
may
be
a
reference
to
the
Hulk
,
a
Marvel
Comics
character.
Dr.
Mundo's
famous
quote,
"Mundo
will
go
where
he
pleases."
may
be
a
reference
to
Duke
Nukem's
quote,
"I'll
go
where
I
please,
and
please
where
I
go."
This
quote
is
also
popular
in
the
League
of
Legends
community.
For
Dr.
Mundo's
Corporate
skin,
many
of
the
quotes
are
references
from
various
office
comedies,
such
as
from
the
movie
Office
Space
.
The
line
"Mundo
smash
like
a
boss!"
is
a
reference
to
the
popular
song
Like
A
Boss
by
The
Lonely
Island
.
The
quote
about
the
mail
room
may
be
a
reference
to
the
Broadway
musical
How
to
Succeed
in
Business
Without
Really
Trying
,
where
the
main
character
starts
off
working
in
the
mail
room
like
one
is
supposed
to
in
business.
The
quote
about
the
ABC's
of
Mundo
-
"Always
be
cleavin"
-
is
a
reference
to
Glengarry
Glen
Ross
where
Alec
Baldwin's
character
explains
that
a
good
salesman
should
"always
be
closing."
The
line
"PC
LOAD
LETTER?
What
the
Mundo
does
that
mean?"
is
a
reference
to
the
comedy
film
Office
Space
.
Some
of
the
papers
that
spill
out
of
Mundo's
briefcase
have
the
heading
"TPS",
a
reference
to
the
"TPS
reports"
in
Office
Space
.
Skins
Toxic
Mundo
bears
a
strong
resemblance
to
The
Hulk
,
a
Marvel
Comics
character.
Mr.
Mundoverse
is
a
reference
to
the

Universe
bodybuilding
competition.
Corporate
Mundo
was
originally
a
legendary
skin
suggestion
made
on
the
forums
that
gained
a
lot
of
popularity.
Corporate
Mundo
and
his
cleaver
makes
an
appearance
in
the
preview
video
for
the
Mac
Version
Launch
of
League
of
Legends.
The
skin
art
for
Mundo
Mundo
shows
him
fitting
a
Dr.
Mundo
costume.
In
the
background,
masks
of
Willump
,
Heimerdinger
,
Teemo
,
Gangplank
,
and
Blitzcrank
can
be
seen
as
well
as
costumes
of
Urf
,

,
a
French
Maid
Nidalee
robe,
and
Cho'Gath
.
Shaco
is
also
visible
near
the
top
right
corner
wearing
a
mask
that
resembles
Mundo.
Executioner
Mundo
bears
a
resemblance
to
Astaroth
from
the
Soul
series
.
Rageborn
Mundo
is
likely
a
tribute
to
Grom
Hellscream
which
shares
the
same
model
as

It
is
also
a
reference
to
the

in
Dungeon
Defenders
when
on

mode.
