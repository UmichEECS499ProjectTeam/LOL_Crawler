Notes
The
lowest
base
movement
speed
in
the
game
is
325.
At
this
speed,
Zeal
grants
16.
25
movement
speed.
The
movement
speed
stat
only
increases
flat
movement
speed,
and
will
not
interact
with
other
percentage
increases.
Strategy
Zeal
is
the
cheapest
item
to
grant
increased
movement
speed
(not
counting
boots).
Since
it
also
grants
a
small
attack
speed
and
critical
strike
chance
bonus,
it's
a
great
item
to
buy
for
slow
and
immobile
AD
Carries
such
as
Ashe
and
Varus
.
Trivia
This
item's
appearance
and
effects
resemble
the
Paladin's
zeal
skill
from
Diablo
II.
