How
to
Get
On
Summoner's
Rift
,
by
landing
the
killing
blow
to
the
Ancient
Golem
(from
which
its
name
is
derived).
By
killing
a
champion
that
currently
possesses
this
buff.
In
this
case,
the
duration
of
the
buff
is
refreshed.
Strategy
Due
to
the
large
mana
regeneration
it
provides,
it
is
excellent
for
many
casters,
especially
those
with
spammable
spells
or
persistent
AoE
effects
such
as
Anivia
,
Karthus
,
Swain
,
Amumu
or
Ziggs
.
Trivia
The
Blue
Buff's
icon
was
originally
for
Tabu
's
Q
ability
before
Tabu
was
cancelled.
