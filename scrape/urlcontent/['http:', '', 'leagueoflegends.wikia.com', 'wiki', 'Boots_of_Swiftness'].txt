Boots
of
Swiftness
grant
the
most
base
movement
speed
across
all
boots,
excluding
Boots
of
Mobility
whose
effect
is
only
temporary.
Because
of
this,
these
boots
are
also
the
most
effective
with
percentage
movement
speed
increasing
effects.
Boots
of
Swiftness
will
also
reduce
the
potency
of
self
slows,
such
as
Varus'
Piercing
Arrow
and
Vi's
Vault
Breaker
.
The
defense
mastery
Swiftness
stacks
multiplicatively
with
Boots
of
Swiftness
to
provide
a
total
of
32.5%
reduction
in
the
potency
of
slows.
Sejuani
's
passive
also
stacks
with
Boots
of
Swiftness
to
provide
a
scaling
reduction
in
the
potency
of
slows
from
32.5%
(at
level
one)
to
43.75%
(at
level
17).
You
can
reduce
the
potency
of
slows
even
more
by
having
the
Swiftness
defense
mastery.
Having
both
of
these
on
Sejuani
makes
the
Slow

Reduction
scale
from
39.25%
(At

to
49.375%
(at
