Notes
The
lowest
base
movement
speed
in
the
game
is
325.
At
this
speed,
Trinity
Force
grants
26
movement
speed.
The
movement
speed
stat
only
increases
flat
movement
speed,
and
will
not
interact
with
other
percentage
increases.
Trinity
Force
is
best
used
on
champions
that
have
some
combination
of
the
following:
One
or
more
low-cooldown
spells
to
trigger
Spellblade
often
(
Udyr
,
Xin
Zhao
).
Ability
to
make
use
of
a
wide
variety
of
champion
statistics
(
Jax
,
Nidalee
).
High
base
attack
damage,
which
Spellblade
amplifies
(
Skarner
).
One
or
more
abilities
that
grant
flat
movement
speed
(
Quinn
).
Difficulty
sticking
to
a
target.
Using
multiple
abilities
in
succession
does
not
result
in
stacking
bonus
damage,
and
the
bonus
damage
does
not
increase
on
a
critical
strike
.
Spellblade
is
a
unique
passive.
However,
if
Iceborn
Gauntlet
is
used
alongside
Lich
Bane
and/or
Trinity
Force
,
it
will
combine
the
slowing
field
of
the
former
with
the
other's
damage
increase.
Lich
Bane
's
proc
will
always
take
priority
over
Trinity
Force
if
both
are
present
in
a
champion's
inventory.

It

however.
Cooldown

after

(after

not
after

Trivia
Trinity
Force
is
one
of
the
only
three
items
that
grants
both
ability
power
and
attack
damage
,
the
others
being
Hextech
Gunblade
and
Guinsoo's
Rageblade
.
Trinity
Force
features
the
most
champion
statistics
in
one
item.
The
highest
damage
possible
from
the
passive
is
260
physical
damage
and
can
be
achieved
with
Cho'Gath
and
Skarner
,
who
both
have
130
base
damage
at
level
18.
The
swords
in
the
icon
clearly
resemble
the
Sheen
item
and
two
swords
in
the
Zeal
item
to
make
the
Trinity
Force
.
Trinity
Force
was
the
most
expensive
item
prior
to
the
V3.10a
patch.
After
this,
the
title
goes
to
the
Infinity
Edge
.
The
Brutalizer
and
Trinity
Force
are
the
only
items
that
have
a
cost
value
not
being
a
multiple
of
5.
The
name
and
icon
for
this
item
were
almost
certainly
inspired
by
"The
Legend
of
Zelda's"
Triforce.
The
Triforce
from
The
Legend
of
Zelda
has
three
pieces:
Power,
Courage,
and
Wisdom.
It
could
also
be
a
reference
to
the
nuclear
bomb
tested
during
World
War
II,
Where
immense
force
was
released
at
Trinity.
Typing
'Tons
of
damage'
into
the
in
the
search
bar
for
the
new
UI
store
finds
the
Trinity
Force
as
a
reference
to
Phreak's
catch-phrase
during
Champion
Showcases
as
well
as
the
meme
that
follows
it.
The
new
"Recommended
Items"
section
of
UI
store
also
displays
"Tons
of
Damage"
as
the
description
for
Trinity
Force
when
shown
as
a
recommended
item
for
a
champion.
It
actually
helps
you
deal
tons
of
damage.
