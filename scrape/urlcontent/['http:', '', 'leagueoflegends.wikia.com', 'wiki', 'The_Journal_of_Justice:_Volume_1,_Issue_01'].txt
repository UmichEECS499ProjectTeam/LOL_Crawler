The
Journal
of
Justice
An
open
letter
from
the
Editor-in-Chief
Senior
Summoner
Ralston
Farnsley
reporting
from
the
Institute
of
War
Welcome,
my
fellow
summoners
,
to
the
inaugural
issue
of
the
League's
newest
journal
of
news
and
commentary.
Our
intent
with
the
Journal
of
Justice
is
to
bring
a
unique
perspective
on
the
events
that
shape
Runeterra
directly
to
you:
the
summoners
that
make
up
the
greatest
organization
that
civilization
has
ever
known.
There
have
been
other
chronicles
such
as
this
in
the
past,
though
they
found
themselves
without
such
a
noble
and
genuine
purpose.
Most
journals
lacked
direction
and
clarity.
For
too
long,
we've
had
to
separate
the
wheat
from
the
chaff
when
it
came
to
distilling
information
from
our
client
city-states.
With
the
Journal
of
Justice,
you
will
receive
accurate
and
thought-provoking
information
on
events
both
great
and
small
that
you
need
to
know
about.
Most
importantly,
through
your
participation
and
patronage,
you
will
help
guide
us
in
the
direction
we
will
take
with
this
journal.
Truly,
this
endeavor
will
be
history
in
the
making.
You,
the
summoners,
shape
Runeterra's
history
in
the
Fields
of
Justice
,
and
now
you
will
also
help
to
shape
it
here.
We
have
taken
our
first
steps
on
a
long
journey
together.
There
will
be
many
changes
and
improvements
the
journal
will
undergo
during
this
venture.
I,
for
one,
am
excited
to
see
where
it
all
will
lead
us.
Precious
Resources
Discovered
in
Kalamanda
Two
massive
nexuses
and
priceless
riches
uncovered
near
Mogron
Pass
Bob
Nashahago
reporting
from
the
Institute
of
War
The
sleepy,
non-descript
village
of
Kalamanda
,
located
near
the
northern
entrance
to
Mogron
Pass
,
now
finds
itself
wide
awake
as
the
leading
lady
on
the
world
stage.
The
village's
mayor,
Anson
Ridley,
reported
this
week
that
a
local
survey
team
has
uncovered
a
massive
deposit
of
gold
and
precious
gems
within
the
village's
sphere
of
influence.
Furthermore,
two
nexuses
of
considerable
magic
potency
have
been
discovered
alongside
the
resource
deposits.
Before
the
discovery,
Kalamanda
was
only
moderately
known
as
a
decent
place
to
fish
for
Valoran
trout
and
not
much
else.
The
village
now
finds
itself
as
the
destination
point
for
adventurers
and
prospectors
seeking
fame
and
riches
beyond
their
wildest
dreams.
The
town
council
has
already
set
up
a
temporary
camp
located
near
the
foothills
that
lead
to
Mogron
Pass
and
the
Great
Barrier
in
anticipation
of
the
great
influx
of
individuals
hoping
to
trade
a
hard
day's
work
for
handsome
rewards.
Mayor
Ridley
has
acknowledged
that
Kalamanda
itself
is
not
properly
equipped
to
extract
and
process
the
raw
riches
that
lay
under
the
village
and
its
environs.
"There's
little
question
that
we
will
be
looking
to
partner
with
an
external
mining
company
or
even
one
of
the
great
city-states
in
the
successful
exploitation
of
these
resources,"
Ridley
said.
"We
are
looking
to
work
with
partners
who
will
respect
Kalamanda's
wishes
to
keep
our
interests
first."
With
the
discovery
of
two
massive
nexuses
in
close
proximity
to
the
valuable
resources,
the
League
has
also
taken
an
interest
in
Kalamanda's
recent
good
fortune.
Council
of
Equity
spokesman
Rovis
Samadon
downplayed
concern
about
the
nexuses'
discovery
by
an
organization
other
than
the
League.
"The
League
works
tirelessly
and
diligently
to
identify
and
maintain
control
over
the
nexuses
found
all
over
the
continent
of
Valoran."
"With
such
a
magically
blessed
world
as
Runeterra
is,
it
is
only
logical
to
assume
that
many
nexuses
remain
undiscovered."
Samadon
continued:
"The
citizens
of
Kalamanda
have
done
the
right
thing
by
not
only
publicly
announcing
their
discovery,
but
also
contacting
the
League
directly
about
it."
The
League
has
since
announced
plans
to
send
a
research
team
of
summoners
and
other
magicians
to
Kalamanda
to
inspect
the
nexuses
for
potential
future
management
and
use
by
the
League.
Piracy
Strikes
Demacian
Navy
DSS
Excursion
lost
to
unknown
pirates
in
the
Conqueror's
Sea
Bob
Nashahago
reporting
from
Demacia
Captain
Lionel
Brickhouse
accepting
command
of
the
DSS
Excursion
â€“
9
August,
19
CLE
The
DSS
Excursion
-
a
cargo
sloop
of
the
Demacian
Navy
-
has
been
reported
lost
at
sea,
an
apparent
victim
of
piracy.
All
hands
aboard
are
currently
missing,
and
no
demands
have
yet
been
made
of
the
Demacian
government
for
their
return.
The
Excursion
was
bound
from
Freljord
to
Demacia
laden
with
unspecified
trade
goods,
according
to
a
spokesperson
for
the
Demacian
Navy,
when
audiopathic
contact
with
the
sloop
was
ultimately
lost.
After
twenty-four
hours
of
communications
silence,
rescue
vessels
were
dispatched
to
the
Excursion's
last
reported
location.
The
Demacian
investigation
of
the
ship's
disappearance
-
led
by
Demacian
Captain
of
the
Guard
and
Champion
of
the
League,
Garen
-
reported
that
some
of
the
logged
cargo
of
the
Excursion
had
been
jettisoned
into
the
Conqueror's
Sea
approximately
twenty
kilometers
from
the
vessel's
last
reported
position.
Other
debris
located
near
the
jettisoned
cargo
was
divined
for
analysis,
revealing
that
the
Excursion
had
been
attacked
and
boarded
while
en
route
to
Demacia.
Further
divination
did
not
reveal
the
identity
of
the
perpetrators
of
the
attack,
though
it
was
gleaned
that
the
attack
occurred
at
night
when
most
of
the
Excursion's
crew
was
in
their
quarters.
The
investigation
has
further
revealed
that
magic
above
maximum
potency
as
dictated
by
the
League
was
used
in
the
attack,
and
necromancy
is
believed
to
have
been
used
based
on
the
evidence
divined.
As
a
result,
the
League
has
dispatched
a
team
of
investigators
led
by
League
Champion
Kayle,
the
Judicator
.
"We
will
be
working
alongside
Demacia
in
their
continued
investigation,"
Kayle
said.
"Piracy
in
all
forms
affects
every
city-state;
only
together,
through
the
shared
benefits
of
the
League,
can
we
crush
such
lawlessness."
Necromancy
is
known
to
be
permitted
as
a
magical
study
by
only
two
of
Valoran's
city-states:
Noxus
and
Zaun
.
While
the
League
has
not
banned
the
use
of
necromancy
throughout
the
continent,
it
is
noted
that
such
magic
is
potentially
dangerous
when
misused
even
slightly.
Extreme
caution
is
advised
when
dealing
with
such
magic.
The
League
does
not
sanction
the
use
of
necromancy,
and
the
study
of
necromancy
and
the
manufacture
of
necromantic
items
are
not
allowed
within
the
Arcanum
Majoris.
Representatives
from
both
Noxus
and
Zaun
have
denounced
the
attack,
though
Noxian
League
representative
Katarina
expressed
concern
over
Demacia's
"aggressive"
trade
policies.
"Demacia's
continued
strong-arm
[trade]
tactics
are
reaping
the
rotten
fruit
from
seeds
they
have
sown
for
countless
years."
Garen,
when
asked
about
the
Noxian
response,
shot
back
at
his
Noxian
counterpart.
"It
is
no
surprise
to
me
or
anyone
familiar
with
the
magical
atrocities
commonly
used
by
rogue
forces
like
Noxus
that
necromancy
was
involved
in
this
pirate
attack.
Rest
assured
that
Demacia
will
stop
at
nothing
to
uncover
the
truth
behind
this
act
of
unprovoked
villainy.
The
perpetrators
will
be
brought
to
justice."
The
Eye
Inside
All
the
latest
gossip
on
the
champions
of
the
League!
Ram
Steed
,
your
eye
inside
the
League
of
Legends
Well
now!
Things
are
certainly
heating
up
in
the
League
-
or
cooling
down
if
you're
one
of
the
unfortunate.
These
past
two
weeks
have
been
quite
the
time
for
some
of
our
favorite
champions.
Let's
take
a
look
and
see
who's
hot
and
who's
not!
Evelynn:
The
Bachelormaker?
It's
always
the
exotic
beauties
you
have
to
watch
out
for,
and
Evelynn
is
a
champion
who
embodies
that
to
the
fullest.
Many
men
have
fallen
prey
to
her
allure
-
or
simply
fallen
prey.
Perhaps
the
most
recent
and
unbelievable
was
that
gypsy
rogue,
the
huckster
they
call
Twisted
Fate
.
The
pair
was
first
romantically
linked
earlier
this
year
when
they
appeared
together
at
the
opening
ceremonies
of
the
Zaun
Glowlight
Festival.
They
were
spotted
once
again
at
the
League
of
Legend's
Fan
Appreciation
Celebration.
That's
not
to
mention
the
many
occasions
this
reporter
has
found
them
out
for
a
quiet
night
together...
but
it
appears
that
the
pair
does
not
see
eye
to
eye.
"Our
time
is
pleasant,"
said
Evelynn.
"But
it
is
nothing
serious.
Nothing
lasts
forever.
Well,
almost
nothing."
Twisted
Fate's
feelings
were
clearly
in
a
different
place.
"I'm
a
man
who
believes
in
keeping
his
options
open.
But
sometimes
you've
got
to
take
a
chance,
and
that
blue-skinned
beauty
is
worth
gambling
on."
Sources
close
to
the
couple
have
claimed
that
vicious
battle
arena
fighting
on
opposite
teams
has
taken
its
toll
on
their
relationship
-
and
on
nearby
city
streets
outside
of
the
Fields
of
Justice.
It
seems
likely
that
Evelynn
will
once
again
eat
the
heart
of
her
lover,
creating
yet
another
eligible
bachelor
in
the
League.
Gragas:
Another
Drunken
Episode
Gragas
may
be
the
hardiest
brewmaster
of
the
foothills,
but
he's
also
the
rowdiest
rouser
of
the
rabble!
This
past
Thursday
night
was
no
exception.
Following
a
successful
battle
arena
match,
Gragas
took
to
his
usual
night
of
celebration
-
this
time
at
the
Lamplighter
Inn
in
Noxus'
famous
Vexallian
Square.
Those
present
say
that
Gragas
arrived
with
his
friend
and
fellow
champion,
Jax
.
They
began
drinking
at
approximately
8:30
pm.
At
10:30
pm,
they
were
buying
rounds
for
the
bar.
By
the
stroke
of
midnight,
twelve
chairs
had
been
broken,
as
had
one
window,
five
bottles,
three
arms,
and
a
handful
of
teeth.
Furthermore,
two
waitresses
claimed
to
have
had
their
buttocks
inappropriately
fondled!
Jax
supposedly
disappeared
earlier
in
the
night,
whereas
Gragas
fled
towards
his
beloved
hills
before
the
Noxian
constabulary
arrived
at
the
Lamplighter.
After
a
cursory
investigation,
Noxian
officials
decided
to
drop
all
charges.
Sergeant
Willem
Nightshade
of
the
Noxian
Constabulary
had
this
to
say:
"As
a
League
Champion
who
has
committed
no
crime
against
the
state
proper,
it
is
unlawful
for
us
to
ban
him
from
our
borders.
Honestly
now,
the
trouble
only
starts
when
the
barkeeps
stupidly
serve
him
too
much
to
drink.
It's
their
risk
if
they
let
him
in
and
give
him
endless
refills
on
alcohol.
What
did
they
expect
would
happen?"
Nightshade
offered
this
as
advice
for
wary
barkeeps
in
Noxus:
"Next
time,
they
should
try
watering
down
his
drink.
On
the
other
hand,
that
might
just
rile
him
up
more.
Anyway,
just
consider
the
risks
when
serving
alcohol
to
someone
whose
nickname
is
'The
Rabble
Rouser'!"
One
thing
is
for
certain:
if
this
reporter
sees
Gragas
coming
into
his
favorite
watering
hole,
he'll
be
heading
for
the
door!
Until
Next
Time...
As
always,
yours
truly
will
keep
on
the
look-out
for
the
juiciest
Champion
news.
Who
knows
what
they'll
be
up
to
next!
Strange
Artifact
Discovered
in
Kumungu
Piltover
prodigy
donates
artifact
to
the
Institute
of
War
Reira
Kashuld
reporting
from
the
Arcanum
Majoris
Wriggle's
Lantern
,
Ezreal's
exciting
find
in
Kumungu
Piltover
Master
Pathfinder
and
Champion
of
the
League,
Ezreal
,
recently
returned
from
a
successful
archeological
expedition
to
Kumungu,
the
mysterious
jungle
region
located
beyond
the
Great
Barrier,
deep
within
the
southern
half
of
continental
Valoran.
"Kumungu
is
a
dangerous
place
for
most,
but
danger
is
of
no
concern
to
me,"
Ezreal
announced
during
a
special
presentation
to
the
Arcanum
Majoris,
the
League's
scholastic
branch
based
in
the
Institute
of
War
.
"New
expeditions
[to
Kumungu]?
Count
on
it."
During
the
event,
Ezreal
stunned
the
assembled
scholars
by
unveiling
and
donating
an
artifact
he
discovered
during
his
expedition.
It
is
expected
to
be
sanctioned
for
use
in
League
matches
once
the
object
can
be
duplicated
and
its
duplicates
are
fully
tested
in
the
League's
Public
Trials
and
Resolutions
battle
arena.
To
the
untrained
eye,
the
artifact
may
appear
to
be
merely
a
mundane
lantern.
"It's
much
more
than
that,"
said
Professor
Alowicious
Chucat,
Lead
Archaeologist
for
the
Arcanum
Majoris.
"Upon
closer
examination
we
discovered
a
name
etched
in
the
base
of
the
Lantern."
Indicating
the
weathered
engraving
of
the
name
Wriggle,
Chucat
continued,
"It
would
seem
that
this
was
an
important
artifact
for
whoever
originally
owned
it.
Judging
by
the
bladed
edges
on
the
bottom
and
the
well-worn
handle,
it
has
definitely
seen
combat.
I
surmise
that
it
was
likely
used
to
ward
off
predatory
animals
native
to
the
region.
It
is
definitely
a
tool
specially
crafted
for
jungle
navigation."
Scholars
universally
agree
that
Kumungu
could
hold
a
wealth
of
valuable
artifacts.
Unfortunately,
the
dangers
associated
with
such
a
savage
and
mysterious
realm
have
not
deterred
a
recent
rush
of
amateur
explorers
to
the
area.
Subsequently,
the
League
has
issued
an
advisory
against
such
expeditions.
"Most
who
fancy
themselves
adventurers
or
archaeologists
are
in
fact
neither,"
Chucat
further
commented.
"Many
who
hear
of
Ezreal's
exploits
think
they
can
do
something
similar.
It
is
important
to
remember
that
not
only
is
Ezreal
a
League
champion,
but
he
is
also
the
lead
explorer
for
a
city-state.
Leave
dangerous
exploration
to
the
professionals."
