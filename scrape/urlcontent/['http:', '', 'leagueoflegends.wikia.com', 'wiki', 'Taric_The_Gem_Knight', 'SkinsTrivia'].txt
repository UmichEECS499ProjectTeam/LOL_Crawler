Trivia
Taric
was
designed
by
Brackhar
.
Taric
is
voiced
by
Dennis
Collins
Johnson
,
who
also
voices
Gangplank
and
Heimerdinger
.
Taric's
name
most
likely
originates
from
the
Arabian
name
"طارق/
Tariq
",
which
means
"The
striker."
A
commonly
used
Quranic
idiom
of
tariq
also
relates
it
to
brilliant
stars,
furthering
its
connection
to
him
as
a
character.
Taric
is
likely
left
handed,
as
that
is
the
hand
that
wields
his
hammer
(though
some
of
his
splash
art
portrays
him
holding
it
in
his
right).
The
in-game
description
for
Taric's
Gemcraft
is
a
reference
to
Diablo
2's
gem
socketing.
Taric's
Gemcraft
is
a
likely
reference
to
the
popular
Tower
Defense
game
series
GemCraft
.
The
Taric
shield
design
is
quite
similar
to
which
has
a
turret
in
the
introduction
image
of
Summoner's
Rift.
Quotes
Taric's
joke
is
a
reference
to
the
80's
cartoon
"Jem"
intro
.
In
Polish
version,
his
/joke
is
a
double
entendre,
as
the
polish
word
for
"gems"
is
also
a
word
used
for
"testicles".
In
literal
translation,
the
joke
is
"Gems?
You
want
to
see
my...
gems?".
Skins
Armor
of
the
5th
Age
Taric
is
a
reference
to
the
World
of
Warcraft
Tier
5
Paladin
Armor.
The
player
Fanatik
photo-shopped
the
pink-tinged
suit,
including
such
things
as
the
leg
warmers,
a
furry
purse,
and
pink
sun-glasses.

The
Chinese
Art
for
Emerald
Taric
and
Armor
of
the
Fifth
Age
Taric
shows
multiple
seals
attached
to
his
armor,
and
hammer,
similar
in
appearance
to
seals
attached
to
armor
and
weapons
worn
by
space
marines
in
the
Warhammer
40,000
franchise.
Bloodstone
Taric
shares
the
Bloodstone
theme
with
Bloodstone
Lissandra
.
Taric
can
be
seen
on
the
"Taric's
Tropical
Tan"
bottle
of
the
Surfer
Singed
skin.
