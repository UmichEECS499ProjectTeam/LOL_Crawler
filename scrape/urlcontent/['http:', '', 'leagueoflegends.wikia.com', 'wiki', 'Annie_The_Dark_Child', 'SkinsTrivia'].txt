Trivia
Riot's
Gameplay
Producer's
girlfriend
is
named
Annie.
She
owns
a
teddy
bear
named
Tibbers.
Annie
is
voiced
by
Cristina
Ulloa
who
also
voices
Amumu
and
Nunu
.
Annie
was
designed
by
Ezreal
and
Guinsoo
,
with
some
help
from
Zileas
.
[3]
Annie
was
one
of
the
first
six
characters
designed,
along
with
Singed
,
Sivir
,
Sion
,
Twisted
Fate
,
and
Lee
Sin
.
[4]
[5]
Annie
was
the
first
champion
to
have
eight
skins.
She
is
now
the
second
champion
with
nine
skins,
the
first
being
Ryze
.
Annie's
last
name,
Hastur,
is
a
reference
to
the
Great
Old
One
Hastur
of
the
Cthulhu
Mythos
.
Annie
is
the
second
champion
to
have
her
skill
icons
remade
together
with
a
Visual
Upgrade
.
The
first
being
Katarina
.
Annie
received
an
early
visual
upgrade
in
the
Philippine
servers,
complete
with
new
particles,
icons
and
quotes,
but
not
her
new
artworks.
Quotes
Annie's
joke
may
be
based
on
Ralph
Wiggum
and
his
nonsensical
manner
of
speech
from
The
Simpsons
.
Annie's
new
taunt,
"I'm
Rubber
and
you're..
on
fire!"
is
based
on
the
first
line
of
the
popular
children's
rhyme
I'm
Rubber,
You're
glue.
Annie's
quote,
"Eeny,
meeny,
miny,
burn!"
is
a
reference
to
the
children's
counting
rhyme,
"Eeny,
meeny,
miny,
moe"
.
In
latinoamerican
servers
this
phrase
was
changed
to
"¿Onta
bebé?,
aquí
está.
Fuego"
("Where's
the
baby?
There
he
is.
Fire"),
where
part
of
that
phrase
corresponds
to
the
dialog
of
Diego
of
the
film
Ice
Age
1
to
patch
3.10,
where
again
was
changed
to
phrase
"De
tin
marín
de
do,
te
quemé"
("De
tin
marín
de
do,
I
burned
you"),
reference
to
the
children's
counting
rhyme
"De
tin
marín
de
do
pingüe..."
Annie's
quote,
"Ashes,
ashes,
they
all
fall
down,"
is
a
reference
to
the
American
version
of
the
nursery
rhyme,
Ring
a
Ring
o'
Roses
.
In
latinoamerican
servers
this
phrase
is
changed
since
patch
3.10
to
"Sol,
solecito,
quémense
un
poquito"
("Sun,
sun,
burn
you
a
little
bit"),
where
part
of
that
phrase
corresponds
to
a
children's
song
Annie
shares
a
quote
with
Ezreal
,
Thresh
,
Irelia
,
and
Evelynn
;
"This
way."

Reverse
Annie
Skin
promo
[6]
Annie's
Goth
skin
is
one
of
the
four
Collector's
Edition
skins,
along
with
the
complementary
skins
of
Black
Alistar
,
Silver
Kayle
,
and
Human
Ryze
.
The
skin
could
be
obtained
by
buying
the
Digital
Copy
in
the
Store,
but
has
since
been
replaced
with
Huntress
Sivir
The
skin
was
to
be
sold
on
the
1st
of
February
to
the
10th
of
February
as
a
celebration
of
a
very
positive
remake
and
the
fact
the
Collector's
Edition
bundle
was
outdated,
this
sale
was
denied
and
is
the
first
sale
of
a
skin
to
ever
be
denied.
Goth
Annie's
rework
appears
to
have
been
based
on
the
Chinese
Artwork.
Annie's
Red
Riding
skin
is
a
reference
to
a
famous
fairy
tale,
Little
Red
Riding
Hood
.
Annie's
Wonderland
skin
is
a
reference
to
Alice
in
Wonderland
,
with
Annie
dressed
as
the
titular
Alice
and
Tibbers
taking
the
place
of
the
White
Rabbit.
Annie
in
Wonderland
was
a
response
to
player
requests
to
change
Tibbers'
skin.
It
is
classified
as
a
Legendary
Skin.
As
of
Annie's
Visual
Upgrade
in
January
2013,
all
of
Annie's
skins
feature
unique
Tibbers'
skin.

four
skins

Bad
Warwick
Annie
in

&
Mad
Hatter
Shaco
Prom
Queen
Annie
&
Almost-Prom
King
Amumu
Goth
Annie
&
Emumu
In
Annie's
Panda
skin,
Tibbers
looks
alot
like
the
Panda
King
from
the
Sly
Cooper
games,
who
used
flame
kun-fu
(named
flame-fu)
&
fireworks
to
fight.
Oddly
enough
Sly
Cooper:
Thieves
in
Time
was
released
in
NA
on
Feb
4th,
and
it
was
the
newest
Sly
game
in
8
years,
and
Panda
Annie
was
released
on
Feb
8th,
only
4
days
apart
from
this
long
awaited
game.
Panda
Annie
shares
a
panda
themed
skin
with

social
outcasts

dark
arcane
knowledge.

has
since
colonized
the

Annie
and
Amumu
are
good
friends
,
explaining
why
both
share
a
similar
skin
theme.
