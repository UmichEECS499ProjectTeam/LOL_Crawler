Trivia
Corki
was
designed
by
Coronach
.
According
to
Corki's
updated
lore,
he
flies
a
Reconnaissance
Operations
Front
Line
(ROFL)
Copter,
a
reference
to
the
Roflcopter
of
internet
subculture.
Heimerdinger
is
the
one
who
made
his
Reconnaissance
Operations
Front
Line
Copter.
Corki's
dance
is
referenced
from
"Do
A
Barrel
Roll",
a
famous
internet
meme.
A
side-by-side
comparison
can
be
seen
here
.
There
has
been
some
speculation
that
Corki
is
possibly
inspired
by
Aurel
Vlaicu
the
Gyrocopter
from
DotA
.
This,
however,
has
been
proven
false,
given
that
Corki
was
released
on
Patch
V0.9.25.21
which
was
dated
September
19,
2009
while
Gyrocopter
was
released
on
DotA
version
6.68
which
is
dated
July
28,
2010.
However,
it's
very
likely
that
Corki
was
based
on
the
Warcraft
III
unit
"Dwarven
Flying
Machine"
,
whose
model
would
later
be
used
by
DoTA
modders
to
make
"Aurel
Vlaicu".
All
3
present
a
midget-like
creature
on
in
"convertible"
flying
machine
with
two
big
engines
that
can
fire
rockets.
Quotes
Corki
uses
many
aviator
slang
phrases
when
he
speaks,
several
of
which
humorously
convey
much
more
vulgar
language:
Blackshoe
-
A
derogatory
term
for
non-flying
personnel,
as
World
War
II
aviators
traditionally
wore
brown
shoes.
Bogey
-
An
unidentified,
potentially
hostile
aircraft.
Charlie
Foxtrot
-
Cluster
F***,
a
term
used
in
a
situation
in
which
everything
has
gone
completely
wrong.
Delta
Sierra
-
Dumb
S***,
an
insult
towards
someone
who
completely
blunders
something.
Lima
Oscar
Lima
-
NATO
phonetic
for
'LOL,'
an
Internet
slang
phrase
that
means
"Laugh
Out
Loud."
Also
the
acronym
for
"League
of
Legends".
Nugget
-
An
aviator
on
his
first
tour,
a
rookie
or
newbie.
Sortie
-
A
military
mission
or
attack
by
a
single
plane.
Speed
of
Heat
-
Very,
very
fast.
Spooled
Up
-
Excited.
Spooling
up
is
also
the
act
of
bringing
an
aircraft's
engines
to
idling
RPMs
to
prepare
for
takeoff.
Up
To
Snuff
-
To
be
aware
of
what
is
going
on.
Whiskey
Delta
-
Weak
D***,
an
insult
aimed
at
an
aviator
who
caves
under
pressure.
Corki's
quote,
"This
is
Major
Tom
to
Ground
Control."
is
a
reference
to
the
David
Bowie's
song
"
Space
Oddity
".
Corki
shares
two
quotes
with
Ziggs
-
"Bombs
away"
and
"Incoming"
.
Skins
The
Red
Baron
was
a
famous
German
World
War
I
ace.
Corki's
Red
Baron
skin
resembles
Richthofen's
plane,
except
the
wings
initially
featured
roundels
rather
than
crosses.
With
patch
V1.0.0.83
however,
Riot
edited
the
skin,
replacing
the
roundels
with
the
famed
crosses.
Corki
was
the
first
champion
to
have
2
legendary
skins.
Although
both
skins
however
have
already
been
retired
to
the
legacy
skins
vault.
All
users
who
signed
up
before
January
14,
2010
received
him
and
UFO
Corki
for
free.
Urfrider
Corki
was
added
in
early
April,
2011
where
he
is
riding
Urf
and
using
his
machine
gun.
If
Corki's
attacks
crit
while
using
the
Urfrider
skin,
Urf
will
grunt
and
throw
his
spatula
at
the
target.
Corki's
Urfrider
skin
is
the
second
skin
presented
by
GANK
industries,
after
Piltover
Customs
Blitzcrank
.
The
video
of
Urfrider
Corki
can
