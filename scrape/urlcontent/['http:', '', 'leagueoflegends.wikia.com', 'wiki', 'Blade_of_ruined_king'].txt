Champions
who
are
highly
dependent
on
basic
attacks
(
Kog'Maw
,
Jax
,
Teemo
,
Tristana
,
etc.)
build
this
item
due
to
the
attack
speed,
lifesteal,
moderate
amount
of
attack
damage,
and
the
passive
that
helps
boost
their
autoattacks.
Champions
with
an
attack
speed
steroids
like
Graves
,
Lee
Sin
,
or
Nocturne
can
synergize
well
with
Blade
of
the
Ruined
King
,
making
better
use
of
the
passive.
Blade
of
the
Ruined
King
is
a
great
item
choice
for
practically
any
autoattacking
champion
that
does
percent
health
damage
like
Kog'Maw
and
Vayne
.
It
may
even
be
considered
for
champions
that
deal
percent
health
damage
with
an
ability
like
Lee
Sin
or
Nasus
.
AD
bruisers
and
assassins
often
build
this
item
(
Talon
,
Pantheon
,
Vi
,
Zed
,
Kha'Zix
,
etc.)
because
its
active
allows
them
to
effectively
chase
important
targets
and
deal
a
reasonable
amount
of
damage.
Notes
The
passive
on-hit
damage
can
not
crit
as
the
bonus
damage
from
the
passive
is
not
added
onto
your
auto
attack,
but
considered
as
bonus
on
hit
effect
damage.
The
heal
from
the
active
effect
will
not
be
equal
to
15%
of
the
target's
health
which
is
calculated
after
considering
damage
mitigation
effects.
Randuin's
Omen
is
a
strong
counter
to
Blade
of
the
Ruined
King
,
as
it
provides
armor,
health,
an
attack
speed
slow
and
a
movement
speed
slow;
and
the
two
actives
mostly
mitigate
each
other.
Disregarding
the
active
ability
and
attack
speed,
to
exceed
damage
gained
by
a
fully
stacked
The
Bloodthirster
on
a
target,
the
target
must
have
at
least
(100-25)/(0.05)
=
1500
health.
To
deal
more
average
damage
to
a
target
than
a
The
Bloodthirster
from
full
to
no
health,
the
target
must
have
over
3000
health.
Although
Hextech
Gunblade
and
Blade
of
the
Ruined
King
both
have
a
Bilgewater
Cutlass
in
their
recipe,
their
item
actives
are
considered
distinct
from
one
another
and
will
not
put
each
other
on
cooldown,
leading
to
a
considerable
degree
of
slowing
if
they
are
used
in
tandem.
Trivia

of
the
Ruined
King
is
