City-State
Tensions
Flare
in
Kalamanda
Demacia/Noxus
tavern
brawl
injures
six,
raises
concerns
Bob
Nashahago
reporting
from
Kalamanda
League
champions
Garen
and
Katarina
break
up
an
inter-city-state
brawl
at
the
Hasty
Hammer
Tavern
in
Kalamanda.
A
village
tavern
brawl
with
reported
injuries
is
typically
not
the
basis
of
world-shaping
news.
Kalamanda
,
however,
is
no
ordinary
village,
and
these
injuries
were
suffered
by
Demacian
and
Noxian
agents.
As
reports
of
more
mineral
strikes
in
the
resource-laden
region
lure
prospective
hopefuls
to
Kalamanda,
Valoran's
city-states
have
added
to
the
growing
population
with
additional
personnel.
Demacia
and
Noxus
,
by
far,
are
investing
the
most
effort
here;
their
growing
presence
also
brings
with
them
a
rivalry
that
is
raising
tensions
within
the
village
to
dangerous
levels.
Kalamanda's
citizens
worry
that
their
good
fortunes
may
turn
for
the
worse
if
Demacia
and
Noxus
come
to
blows
over
the
future
of
their
village.
This
tension,
at
times
palpable,
manifested
itself
last
Saturday
when
Demacian
and
Noxus
guards
drinking
at
the
Hasty
Hammer
Tavern
got
into
a
drunken
brawl
–
a
brawl
that
witnesses
claimed
was
"bordering
on
a
riot".
At
least
six
guards
were
seriously
injured
when
an
argument
between
the
rival
guards
erupted
into
violence.
It
took
what
appeared
to
be
the
entire
Kalamanda
constabulary,
several
local
patrons
of
the
tavern,
and
two
League
champions
to
break
up
the
fight.
No
formal
charges
have
been
made
against
the
guards
by
the
constables,
as
representatives
of
both
city-states
are
currently
working
together
with
local
authorities
to
sort
out
the
details
of
the
incident.
The
stakes
are
high
for
all
city-states
courting
Kalamanda.
Yesterday,
Mayor
Anson
Ridley
announced
that
the
Kalamanda
Village
Council
voted
overwhelmingly
in
favor
of
pushing
for
an
exclusive
mining
agreement
with
one
of
the
city-states,
as
opposed
to
allowing
multiple
contracts.
The
altercation
between
Demacia
and
Noxus
the
night
before
was
fresh
on
the
mayor’s
mind
as
he
explained
the
ruling:
"We
do
not
wish
to
see
hatred
between
powerful
nations
rekindled
because
of
Kalamanda’s
mineral
bounty.
We
must,
and
will
continue
to
act
in
the
village’s
best
interests
–
both
for
our
own
prosperity
and
security.
The
presence
of
just
a
single
city-state
here
will
be
in
everyone’s
best
interest."
Following
the
village
council
ruling,
both
Demacia
and
Noxus
announced
a
further
increase
in
their
presence
within
Kalamanda,
as
both
city-states
have
emerged
as
the
leaders
in
securing
exclusive
mining
contracts
with
the
village.
Both
delegations
already
have
escalated
their
presence
in
Kalamanda
by
appointing
League
champions
as
the
leaders
of
their
respective
missions.
The
Demacian
delegation
is
currently
led
by
Garen,
the
Might
of
Demacia
,
while
the
Noxus
delegation
is
directed
by
Katarina,
the
Sinister
Blade
–
the
eldest
daughter
of
one
of
Noxus'
top
generals
attached
to
the
Noxian
High
Command.
The
presence
of
the
champions
in
the
village
gives
a
clear
indication
that
both
Demacia
and
Noxus
are
committed
to
success
in
Kalamanda.
Adding
to
the
rumors
and
speculation
of
future
chaos
in
Kalamanda,
both
Garen
and
Katarina
were
present
at
the
brawl
that
took
place
in
the
Hasty
Hammer
Tavern
on
Saturday.
To
their
credit,
however,
both
champions
were
instrumental
in
breaking
up
the
fight
and
preventing
further
violence
from
erupting.
While
their
presence
bolsters
the
spirits
of
their
respective
city-states,
however,
it
adds
to
the
growing
unease
from
others
in
Kalamanda.
There
has
been
a
recent
rise
in
tension
between
the
historically
opposed
city-states
that
may
make
the
political
struggle
in
Kalamanda
turn
violent
once
more.
No
progress
has
been
made
in
identifying
the
culprits
responsible
for
acts
of
piracy
against
the
DSS
Excursion
several
weeks
ago,
and
the
ship’s
whereabouts
remain
unknown.
A
host
of
accusations
from
both
sides
regarding
the
incident
have
intensified
recently.
Furthermore,
both
city-states
have
recently
increased
the
number
of
faction-affiliated
champions
within
the
League.
During
the
past
two
months,
four
of
the
five
new
champions
accepted
into
the
League
have
been
affiliated
with
either
Demacia
or
Noxus.
While
the
village
seems
to
be
settling
down,
it
is
highly
doubtful
that
it
will
return
to
a
state
of
calm.
Kalamanda
will
be
hard-pressed
to
diffuse
the
growing
turmoil
caused
by
the
Demacian
and
Noxian
presences.
The
Sword
and
the
Self
A
discourse
on
duty
and
self-discovery
Aria
Breker
commenting
from
Demacia
To
serve
in
the
Demacian
armed
forces
is
more
than
just
an
exalted
honor
for
each
and
every
citizen
in
our
fair
city-state
-
it
is
the
truest
way
to
realize
your
purpose
in
life.
Training
alongside
your
neighbors,
sharpening
body
and
mind
in
the
pursuit
of
absolute
discipline
is
a
formative
experience
that
shapes
every
Demacian
towards
inimitable
virtue.
It
is
in
this
way
that
we
can
live
lives
of
unmatched
morality.
It
is
the
way
to
ensure
the
ideals
of
our
nation
and
the
safety
of
our
allies.
This
is
what
it
means
not
only
to
be
a
Demacian
soldier,
but
a
Demacian
citizen.
Each
and
every
one
of
our
citizens
who
proudly
serves
our
military
is
a
shining
example
in
these
dark
times.
Beyond
the
requisite
service,
however,
there
are
exemplary
individuals
who
dedicate
their
entire
lives
to
the
advancement
of
Demacian
ideals.
One
example
is
the
Crownguard
family,
a
truly
extraordinary
household
whose
every
member
has
pledged
his
or
her
life
to
honored
service.
The
head
of
the
family,
Marcus
Crownguard,
and
his
wife
Lilia,
are
both
well-known,
highly
regarded
officials
of
the
legislative
Demacian
Council.
Their
valiant
son,
Garen
Crownguard,
renowned
amongst
friends
and
enemies
alike
as
the
Might
of
Demacia,
is
highly
decorated
within
the
military.
He
is
also
a
League
champion,
defending
Demacian
ideals
on
the
Fields
of
Justice
with
an
unmatched
fervor.
But
it
is
the
youngest
of
the
brood,
Luxanna
“Lux”
Crownguard
,
who
is
of
particular
note
today.
Eager
to
follow
in
the
footsteps
of
her
brother,
Lux
enrolled
in
the
military
at
the
early
age
of
13.
While
undergoing
rigorous
combat
training
as
is
the
hallmark
of
the
Demacian
regimen,
Lux's
extraordinary
prowess
with
magic
was
immediately
recognized.
She
seized
the
opportunity
to
study
under
the
top
magicians
residing
in
Demacia,
where
her
work
was
so
exemplary
that
she
was
immediately
inducted
into
service
as
a
part
of
the
Demacian
Security
Brigade.
Through
her
work
with
the
DSB,
she
was
instrumental
in
numerous
infiltration
efforts
of
enemy
territory.
The
Noxian
military
may
claim
whatever
they
wish
when
boasting
about
their
considerable
power,
but
what
does
it
say
when
one
of
their
allies’
arcane
spells
was
mimicked
on
sight
by
Lux?
Rather
than
employing
the
captured
magic
in
furtherance
of
the
dark
arts
and
whatever
other
horrors
Noxus
regularly
conjures
up,
Lux
has
chosen
to
transfer
its
energies
into
a
powerful
tool
for
the
pursuit
of
justice.
Through
service,
education,
and
above
all,
selfless
devotion
to
the
greater
good,
Lux
has
found
her
calling,
and
she
continues
to
light
the
way
for
Demacia.
She
has
understood
and
accepted
her
path
with
pride,
and
it
is
for
the
benefit
of
not
only
our
great
city,
but
also
those
who
choose
to
ally
themselves
with
us.
There
are
those
in
this
world
who
would
try
to
dress
up
their
indiscriminate
loyalist
tendencies
in
the
guise
of
absolute
devotion
without
any
shade
of
the
self.
Serving
under
a
banner
as
an
empty
husk,
without
purpose
or
reason,
is
no
more
than
a
refusal
to
admit
defeat
in
the
face
of
one's
self.
To
quote
from
the
Measured
Tread:
"When
Demacians
march
forth,
ridding
Valoran
of
the
evils
of
selfishness
and
greed
under
the
pristine
banner
of
justice,
we
know
who
we
are
and
what
we
fight
for,
unapologetically."
For
our
true
strength
can
only
be
realized
when
we
can
trust
that
each
of
our
neighbors,
be
they
humble
or
noble
in
origin,
will
heed
the
call
of
the
clarion
united
in
thought
and
purpose.
Trade
Routes
Between
Noxus
and
Zaun
Secured
Noxus
welcomes
the
new
allied
villages
of
Askay
and
Meland
Richor
Ebony
commenting
from
Noxus
There
are
often
harsh
words
for
those
with
the
courage
to
do
what
is
necessary
to
protect
the
future.
Idealists
will
prattle
on
about
the
freedom
of
men
and
the
tyranny
of
conquerors.
Talk
is
cheap,
and
you
will
find
these
so
called
visionaries
cowering
in
the
corner
the
moment
there
is
an
enemy
at
your
gates.
Prosperity,
on
the
other
hand,
is
seldom
cheaply
bought.
Rather,
it
is
purchased
with
the
blood
of
patriots.
Permit
me,
for
a
moment,
to
indulge
in
an
example.
At
the
base
of
the
Ironspine
Mountains,
along
the
main
trade
route
between
Noxus
and
Zaun
,
lie
two
smaller
villages:
Askay
and
Meland.
For
generations,
the
people
of
these
villages
have
been
embroiled
in
a
bloody
feud,
the
cause
of
which
has
since
lapsed
from
memory.
While
relations
between
Zaun
and
Noxus
have
always
been
friendly,
the
lawlessness
of
this
region
has
always
complicated
the
development
of
trade
agreements
between
our
great
nations.
Until
recent
times,
most
interactions
have
been
limited
to
wartime
pacts
serviced
by
mercenary
contracts
and
alchemical
weapons.
Current
events,
however,
have
taught
us
that
there
is
much
we
can
share
with
our
eccentric
neighbors
on
the
far
side
of
the
mountain
range.
As
a
result,
there
has
been
much
interest
in
pursuing
more
thriving
peacetime
trade
relations.
With
our
Demacian
conflicts
now
settled
in
the
more
civilized
manner
taught
to
us
by
the
arrival
of
the
League
of
Legends,
it
was
no
hardship
for
the
High
Command
to
simply
retask
a
few
of
its
more
specialized
military
units
with
resolving
the
issue.
For
these
specialists,
deposing
the
current,
radical
political
sects
in
favor
of
a
newer
and
more
forward
thinking
ruling
body
was
a
relatively
simple
matter.
Since
this
time,
both
Askay
and
Meland
have
seen
fit
to
put
aside
their
differences
and
declare
allegiance
to
our
sovereign
city-state.
Some
might
call
facilitating
a
political
coup
insidious
and
underhanded.
To
these
hopeless
romantics,
I
would
pose
the
following
question:
was
the
political
situation
before
our
intervention
preferable?
Should
the
High
Command
simply
have
allowed
the
warmongering
leaders
of
Askay
and
Meland
to
strain
relations
between
ourselves
and
our
allies,
and
continue
to
impose
a
reign
of
terror
upon
their
own
people?
These
two
villages
are
both
now
protectorates
of
Noxus.
Their
men
will
no
longer
make
war
on
their
neighbors,
thus
perpetuating
old
hatreds.
Their
women
will
no
longer
raise
their
offspring
alone,
with
their
fathers
either
deceased
or
away
at
a
frivolous
war.
Their
children
will
grow
up
free
from
the
oppression
of
a
homeland
in
turmoil,
and
with
the
opportunity
to
pursue
higher
education
in
Noxian
Academies.
For
Askay
and
Meland,
this
is
the
dawn
of
a
new
era
–
an
era
free
of
mutually
assured
destruction.
We
will
be
tested.
Sacrifices
will
be
made.
It
will
be
for
a
better
future.
Forever
strong!
The

Senior
Summoner
Ralston
Farnsley
commenting
from
the
Institute
of
War
Once
more,
we
dip
into
the
Mailbag
of
Justice,
checking
the
pulse
of
Valoran!
"A
question
has
been
bothering
me
since
the
start
of
the
League
[twenty]
years
ago:
how
is
it
that
the
League
can
accept
Champions
that
are
in
open
rivalry
with
one
another,
for
example
Garen
and
Katarina?
I
understand
the
need
for
equal
representation
in
the
League,
but
what
do
League
officials
do
to
ensure
that
no
fighting
breaks
out
between
their
Champions?"
--
Meir
Summoning
magic
is
powerful
magic,
Meir,
and
all
champions
are
bound
by
its
incantations.
When
a
champion
who
is
bonded
with
a
summoner
enters
a
Field
of
Justice,
the
magic
used
in
the
summoning
prevents
a
champion
from
inflicting
harm
on
a
fellow
teammate.
This
allows
enemies
who
would
normally
attack
each
other
on
sight
to
work
together
without
fear
of
betrayal.
The
politics
of
Valoran
would
surely
grind
to
a
halt
without
such
magic,
as
battle
arenas
would
degenerate
into
bloody
free-for-alls.
There
are
special
battle
arenas,
however,
that
specifically
exclude
certain
champions
from
being
chosen
for
participation.
These
matches
are
always
ones
that
involve
two
specific
city-states
resolving
a
conflict
between
them.
These
sorts
of
matches
occur
very
infrequently;
most
of
the
battle
arenas
the
League
administers
involve
summoners
that
are
conducting
business
amongst
themselves.
When
they
do
happen,
the
summoners
representing
the
city-state
may
only
select
champions
who
are
affiliated
with
the
city-state,
or
champions
who
have
declared
neutrality
in
their
affiliations.
"I
was
just
wondering
if
Kennen,
the
Heart
of
the
Tempest
,
had
attended
the
performance
by
Sona
and
if
so
what
he
thought
of
the
musical
prodigy?"
--
Skyesilvary
We
tried
to
get
Kennen
to
write
his
thoughts
on
Sona’s
command
performance
in
Ionia
(which
he
did
attend),
though
he
could
not
seem
to
sit
still
long
enough
to
complete
it.
Instead,
we
transcribed
his
unique
perspective
on
the
performance.
"It
was
very
good
I
found
myself
being
carried
far
away
to
a
magical
and
serene
place
which
for
me
is
quite
different
than
what
I
am
normally
used
to
seeing
since
I
must
be
ready
at
all
times
to
unleash
the
fury
of
the
tempest
upon
those
who
would
bring
imbalance
to
our
world
of
harmony
in
all
things
oh
I’m
sorry
I
was
talking
about
Sona’s
performance
oh
yes
she
was
delightful
I
found
myself
drifting
off
on
a
sea
of
bliss
and
tranquility
which
is
so
uncommon
since
being
part
of
the
Kinkou
requires
me
to
be
ready
at
all
times
should
I
be
called
upon..."
Our
apologies
go
to
Kennen
for
cutting
his
thoughts
short,
as
they
did
continue
on
for
a
bit
longer.
Alas,
we
do
not
have
the
space
in
this
issue
(or
the
next)
to
cover
his
full
feelings
on
the
performance.
"If
I
may
ask
what
kind
of
summoners
do
you
get
for
the
deployment
of
minion
forces.
I
suspect
that
not
every
minion
is
controlled
individually
like
we
Champion
Summoners
do,
but
are
controlled
as
a
pack,
or
generally
more
than
one
minion
at
a
time.
This
would
explain
why
the
minions
aren't
the
brightest,
since
it
would
be
hard
to
keep
everyone
in
check."

Minions
in
the
Fields
of
Justice
are
animated
constructs
that,
once
unleashed,
follow
pre-planned
patterns
of
behavior.
The
summoners
–
either
those
controlling
champions
or
powering
the
Field
of
Justice
–
have
no
control
over
the
minions.
Rather,
the
summoners
who
are
assigned
to
the
maintenance
of
a
battle
arena
focus
on
quickly
and
efficiently
constructing
the
minions.
Constructing
each
minion
takes
a
miniscule
amount
of
magic
from
the
nexus
it
spawns
from.
These
summoners,
who
are
usually
apprentice
summoners
that
reside
within
the
Institute
of
War,
are
in
many
ways
the
engine
that
allows
the
battle
arenas
to
function.
All
summoners
who
come
to
the
Institute
of
War
will
spend
time
performing
such
tasks.

A
behind-the-scenes
look
at
the
lives
of
the
League’s
champions
Auras
Lam
reporting
from
the
Institute
of
War
With
as
much
dedication
as
it
takes
to
fight
on
the
Fields
of
Justice,
how
do
our
League
champions
find
the
time
to
do
anything
else?
But
indeed,
it
is
with
immense
passion
that
our
brave
heroes
commit
themselves
to
hobbies
during
their
off-hours.
In
this
issue,
we
look
at
what
Evelynn
,
Twisted
Fate
,
and
Ryze
do
in
their
spare
time!
Tango
for
Two
A
certain
pair
of
League
champions
were
the
talk
of
the
evening
after
their
scintillating
display
of
dance
expertise
last
month
at
the
Royal
Masquerade
Ball,
Demacia's
yearly
costumed
carnival.
Evelynn
and
Twisted
Fate
cleared
the
floor
dancing
a
sultry
tango,
surprising
guests
from
all
over
Valoran.
The
Journal
of
Justice
was
lucky
enough
to
be
invited
to
observe
a
private
dance
session
with
the
spicy
couple.
From
our
observations,
it’s
a
no
brainer
why
tango
is
the
dance
of
choice
for
this
couple.
As
they
tore
up
the
floor,
their
eyes
never
left
each
other,
and
the
heat
of
their
close
embrace
scorched
the
curtains
of
the
ballroom.
Watching
Evelynn’s
leg
snake
around
Twisted
Fate
as
he
led
her
around
the
dance
floor
was
enough
to
understand
why
this
couple
regularly
ends
up
at
the
mercy
of
one
Ram
Steed.
Twisted
Fate
explained
their
choice
of
dance:
“Tango
is
the
dance
style
that
best
expresses
our
relationship
-
we
aren’t
just
dancing;
we’re
competing
with
every
step,
dip,
and
spin.”
Evelynn
and
Twisted
Fate
are
currently
guest
instructors
at
the
Crown
Dance
Academy
in
Demacia.
If
you’re
lucky,
you
might
score
a
spot
in
their
extremely
popular
class,
though
beware
-
many
students
have
been
seen
fleeing
out
the
front
door
after
inciting
jealousy
while
pressing
too
closely
to
either
instructor!
The
Lost
Magic
of
Runeterra
While
many
of
the
League
champions
use
their
off-hours
to
pursue
various
hobbies,
a
dedicated
few
choose
to
spend
their
entire
lives
honing
their
craft.
Ryze
is
such
a
champion,
entrenching
himself
in
the
study
of
arcane
magic
in
our
very
own
Institute
of
War.
The
League
took
notice
of
Ryze’s
absolute
dedication
to
the
craft
immediately
after
he
joined
the
League.
Ryze's
use
of
thorn
magic,
the
ancient
art
of
drawing
magical
energies
through
spells
tattooed
onto
his
body,
has
made
this
brand
of
spellcraft
well-known
throughout
Valoran,
though
Ryze
is
currently
the
only
known
thorn
mage
in
the
world.
In
exchange
for
free
use
of
the
Institute's
grand
laboratories
and
resources,
Ryze
now
works
in
conjunction
with
the
League
to
discover
lost
magic
and
deepen
the
understanding
of
modern
magic.
Ryze
commented,
"The
progression
of
magic
throughout
the
ages
is
my
real
interest,
while
chronicling
the
history
of
Runeterra
is
merely
a
useful
side
benefit
for
the
League.
Uncovering
the
magic
that
has
been
long
lost
to
the
world
will
unlock
immense
power.
We
can
use
such
magic
for
various
causes,
such
as
reversing
the
damage
inflicted
upon
Valoran
by
foolish
mages
during
the
Rune
Wars."
As
part
of
his
research,
Ryze
has
become
well-acquainted
with
the
numerous
League
champions
who
have
volunteered
their
time
to
come
under
Ryze's
intense
scrutiny.
Taric,
the
Gem
Knight
and
fellow
champion
of
the
League,
is
a
frequent
collaborator.
When
asked
about
his
feelings
on
the
study
of
magic,
Taric
answered,
"It
is
through
study
and
collaboration
that
we
can
increase
our
own
strengths
in
addition
to
understanding
each
other.
I
am,
however,
aware
that
a
number
of
other
champions
shun
this
research
in
the
belief
that
we
are
becoming
weaker
by
exposing
ourselves.
I
say
to
them:
come
onto
the
battlefield
and
see
what
advantages
the
League’s
shared
knowledge
has
granted
us."
