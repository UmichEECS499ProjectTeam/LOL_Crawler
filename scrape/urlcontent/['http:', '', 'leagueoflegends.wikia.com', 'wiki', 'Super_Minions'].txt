A
super
minion
is
the
most
powerful
type
of
minion
that
fights
in
League
of
Legends
.
Classic
In
the
classic
game
mode,
they
will
only
spawn
in
a
lane
while
the
enemy
inhibitor
on
that
lane
is
down.
In
that
case,
one
super
minion
will
spawn
in
each
minion
wave,
in
front
of
regular
minions.
If
all
inhibitors
are
destroyed,
a
second
super
minion
will
spawn
in
each
lane
behind
the
first
one.
While
super
minions
are
spawning,
no
siege
minion
will
spawn
in
that
lane.
On
Twisted
Treeline
,
super
minions
deal
more
damage
but
have
less
health.
Super
minions
are
controlled
by
artificial
intelligence,
and
use
a
melee
attack
against
their
enemies.
Their
health,
resistances
and
damage
are
far
superior
to
regular
minions,
receive
only
70%
damage
from
towers
and
grant
nearby
minions
70
armor
and
magic
resist.
Super
minions
are
able
to
easily
push
the
lanes
and
destroy
enemy
turrets
if
left
unprotected.
Super
minions
will
stop
spawning
after
the
Inhibitor
on
that
lane
re-spawns.
The
super
minions'
stats
increase
over
time,
with
no
known
cap.
In
Dominion
mode,
each
minion
wave
is
composed
of
2
regular
minions
with
1
miniature-sized
version
of
a
super
minion.
The
item
Banner
of
Command
can
be
cast
on
1
allied
super
minion
for
several
bonus
advantages.
If
you
attempt
to
look
at
the
super
minion's
buff,
the
source
is
named
as
"Super
Mech".
Super
minions
actually
stop
spawning
as
soon
as
the
Inhibitor
respawn
is
called
out
rather
than
when
it
actually
spawns.
This
means
that
when
it
does
respawn
the
minion
wave
that
spawned
after
the
call
out
will
be
a
regular
minion
wave.
