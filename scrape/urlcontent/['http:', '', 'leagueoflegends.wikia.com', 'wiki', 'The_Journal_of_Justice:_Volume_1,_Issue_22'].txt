Ionia
Celebrates
Annual
Festival
of
Fire
League
Champions
Shen
and
Akali
perform
as
guests
of
honor
Henril
Dreving
reporting
from
Ionia
Shen
and
Akali
performing
as
guests
of
honor.
Ionians
from
every
province
gathered
beneath
the
flowered
branches
of
the
Great
Tree
in
the
Serene
Gardens
yesterday
for
the
city-state’s
annual
Festival
of
Fire.
An
early
summer
tradition,
this
festival
is
a
symbol
of
Ionian
culture,
celebrating
the
cleansing
and
rebirth
of
the
spirit.
League
Champions
Shen
and
Akali
attended
the
festival
as
guests
of
honor,
performing
in
the
festival’s
retelling
of
The
Tale
of
Reina.
Festivities
began
early
yesterday
morning
as
citizens
poured
into
the
Serene
Gardens.
Vendors
set
up
shop
along
the
garden’s
edges,
offering
wares
of
traditional
Ionian
food,
garb,
and
antique
weaponry.
Citizens
mingled
in
the
shade
of
the
Great
Tree
and
wrote
their
woes
and
worries
on
scrolls
to
be
hung
from
the
Tree’s
branches.
“This
is
the
primary
tradition
of
the
festival,”
explained
Master
Hana,
an
Ionian
adjudicator.
“Together,
we
identify
that
which
plagues
us.
As
we
enter
the
darkness
of
night,
which
we
call
'facing
the
Blood
Moon',
we
confront
them
as
one.
With
the
rising
of
the
sun,
our
fears
and
woes
are
cleansed,
our
spirits
rekindled.”
During
the
night,
Ionian
citizens
were
treated
to
various
musical
and
theatric
performances
pertaining
to
Ionian
history
or
legend.
The
headlining
performance
this
year
featured
League
Champions
Shen
and
Akali,
who
performed
The
Tale
of
Reina,
a
legend
in
which
an
ancient
Ionian
warrior
is
hunted
by
an
evil
spirit.
Akali
took
the
part
of
Reina
herself,
dressed
in
formal
Ionian
red
and
white
battle
garb,
and
Shen
played
the
spirit
that
plagued
her,
adorned
with
a
fearsome
mask.
As
the
legend
goes,
Reina
fled
the
spirit
for
years,
yet
it
always
found
and
tormented
her.
Finally,
Reina
donned
her
own
mask
to
confront
the
spirit,
but
when
she
turned
to
face
it,
it
never
came
again,
frightened
away
by
her
strength.
“The
story
bears
the
same
message
we
embrace
at
the
festival,”
said
Akali
after
the
performance.
“We
all
have
darkness
that
pursues
us.
Here,
we
identify
our
fears
and
worries
when
we
hang
them
upon
the
Great
Tree.
Like
Reina,
we
must
confront
the
darkness
within
our
spirits.
We
must
be
stronger
than
that
which
torments
us.”
When
the
sun
rose
in
the
morning,
when
the
Tree
had
become
almost
fully
concealed
behind
scrolls,
an
Ionian
summoner
lit
them
briefly
aflame.
As
the
magic
dissipated,
the
sun
shone
brilliantly
through
the
branches
of
the
Great
Tree.
“This
is
the
festival’s
greatest
lesson,”
said
Master
Hana.
“Out
of
any
darkness
comes
the
grandest
of
light.”
Ghost
Sightings
Reported
Near
the
Bubbling
Bog
Investigators
remain
skeptical
Quinton
Groat
reporting
from
Lirab
The
citizens
of
Lirab,
a
small
Demacian
town
just
south
of
the
infamous
Bubbling
Bog,
have
been
stirred
up
by
a
recent
rash
of
“ghost
sightings”.
According
to
sources,
a
number
of
specters
have
been
seen
floating
above
various
parts
of
the
Bubbling
Bog’s
viscous
expanse.
“Due
to
the
bog’s
unstable
nature,
it’s
very
difficult
to
investigate
these
claims,”
said
Parrin
Maylor,
the
Governor
of
Lirab.
“It
does
make
you
start
to
wonder
though,
once
you’ve
heard
the
same
story
repeated
so
many
times.
That’s
why
I
sent
word
to
Demacia.”
The
first
report
came
from
Horatio
Nerp,
a
gas
farmer
whose
property
abuts
on
the
bog
itself.
Nerp’s
attention
was
first
drawn
by
a
light
that
seemed
to
bounce
along
above
the
bog’s
surface
in
the
distance.
“I’ve
lived
here
my
whole
forty-four
years
and
I’ve
never
seen
any
light
like
that.
Then,
this
see-through
critter
pops
up
outta
nowhere.
I
don’t
scare
easy,
but
I
didn’t
stick
around
to
make
sure
it
was
a
real
ghost.
I
dunno
what
else
you’d
call
it
though.”
The
sudden
appearance
of
these
ghastly
apparitions
may
not
be
arbitrary.
Lirab
isn’t
a
popular
place
to
live.
Gases
emanating
from
the
Bog
often
drift
south
on
the
wind,
carrying
with
them
a
variety
of
“pungent”
odors.
In
such
a
modest
population,
people
took
notice
when
a
new
face
appeared,
just
before
the
sightings
began.
“Sullen-looking
guy
.
Nobody
talked
to
him
because
he
seemed…well…creepy,
but
he
didn’t
seem
to
want
company
anyhow.
He
had
a
serious
hunch,
a
cowl
pulled
low
over
his
face,
and
he
always
carried
around
this
old
shovel,”
added
Nerp.
“He
wandered
around
town
for
a
bit,
like
he
was
looking
for
something,
then
left
as
quietly
as
he
came.
When
you
live
this
far
off
the
beaten
path,
sometimes
you
just
opt
not
to
ask
questions.”
Wesker
Mollifen,
an
investigator
appointed
by
Demacia
to
evaluate
these
reports,
remains
unconvinced.
“You
always
hear
about
these
sorts
of
things
from
small
communities
on
the
far
reaches
of
civilization.
It’s
no
coincidence.
Rumors
tend
to
spread
quickly
and
then
people’s
eyes
start
playing
tricks
on
them.
I’m
not
saying
anyone’s
intentionally
lying.
This
is
probably
the
result
of
illumination
from
swamp
gases
and
overactive
imaginations.”
The
Art
of
Summoning
Setting
the
record
straight
on
the
role
of
summoners
L.B.
Briskes
commenting
from
the
Institute
of
War
If
my
secretary
Olivia
can
be
trusted
(her
honesty,
I
mean
–
she
is
a
truly
dismal
wing-woman),
many
of
your
letters
convey
confusion
as
to
the
magnitude
of
the
roles
played
by
summoners
in
the
League
of
Legends
.
We
are
not
merely
robed,
second-string
stagehands
fervently
supporting
the
lauded
champions
of
the
League.
We
are
not
the
janitors
or
night
watchmen
of
society
as
a
whole.
We
are
the
penultimate
practitioners
of
sorcery,
manipulating
the
very
fabric
of
reality
with
such
precision
that
we
may
steer
the
course
of
history
whilst
preserving
Runeterra
with
calculated
efficiency.
And
no,
I
have
never
extracted
a
rabbit
from
my
hat
–
that
would
eat
up
all
the
space
for
contraband.
Some
people
have
not-so-politely
indicated
that
my
opinion
of
summoners
may
be
inflated
due
to
the
fact
that
I
am
one.
I
say
that
a
low
opinion
of
others
should
not
be
mistaken
as
a
high
opinion
of
oneself.
Yes,
yes,
magic
by
and
of
itself
is
not
uncommon
in
Runeterra
and
many
people
are
capable
of
manifesting
a
couple
cantrips,
but
summoning
magic
exists
on
an
entirely
different
level.
Not
only
must
one
reach
into
the
ether
and
locate
a
single
being
amongst
the
swirling
miasma
of
living
energy,
but
one
must
then
mentally
assume
that
same
space
in
addition
to
one’s
own.
This
is
roughly
akin
to
simultaneously
following
the
flight
paths
of
two
specific
flies
in
a
swarm,
one
with
either
eye.
(For
those
of
you
staring
lizard-eyed
in
two
directions
with
unimpressed,
folded
arms,
the
analogy
falls
far
short
of
the
act.
That
is
extremely
unsettling
though.)
Once
one
has
tackled
the
art
of
thinking
in
two
places,
one
must
finesse
one’s
integration
with
the
subject.
This
is
basically
like
trying
to
put
a
jellyfish
in
a
sweatshirt
with
an
appropriate
amount
of
sleeves.
Depending
on
the
strength
and
willingness
of
the
subject,
there
is
an
equivalent
danger
of
being
stung.
The
process
of
then
performing
heroic
feats
in
your
new
jelly-sweatshirt
is
relatively
simple
compared
to
the
rest
of
it,
though
this
is
what
garners
the
most
attention.
Summoners
do
this
every
day.
The
strain
of
concentration
and
energy
needed
to
fulfill
such
a
task
would
alone
drive
most
men
stark
mad,
and
that’s
before
considering
the
consequences
of
any
misstep.
They
are
universally
disastrous.
Even
the
most
experienced
summoners
are
monitored
during
the
summoning
process
in
hopes
of
preventing
(or
at
least
minimizing)
the
destruction
should
something
go
wrong.
Most
summoners
commit
decades
of
their
lives
to
mastering
the
many
arcane
fields
which
comprise
summoning
magic.
The
League
screens
thousands
of
candidates
every
year
with
extreme
prejudice,
identifying
only
a
handful
who
will
be
given
the
opportunity,
through
rigorous
study
and
evaluation,
to
be
entrusted
with
its
secrets.
There
are
no
cheap
parlor
tricks,
no
techmaturgical
shortcuts,
and
no
safety
nets.
In
return,
summoners
are
courted
by
city-states
to
represent
them
in
political
disputes
and
afforded
the
highest
accommodations
society
has
to
offer.
Though
you
don’t
see
us
on
the
Fields
of
Justice
,
we
are
the
life
behind
every
action,
the
architects
of
every
match.
I’m
not
known
for
my
appreciation
of
the
efforts
of
others,
but
to
all
you
summoners
who
make
the
League
of
Legends
possible,
I
hereby
tip
my
hat.
Alright,
where
did
this
rabbit
come
from?

The

“
Xin
Zhao
's
story
of
facing
hardship
has
been
majorly
inspiring
to
me
personally.
When
it
feels
like
the
entire
world
is
against
you,
it
just
seems
so
easy
to
give
up,
but
Xin
Zhao
never
gave
up
and
always
continued
to
fight.
Many
times
in
my
life
I
have
been
presented
with
situations
where
it
would
just
be
easier
to
give
up.
So
my
question
for
you,
Xin
Zhao,
is
how
do
you
maintain
the
will
to
fight
against
impossible
odds?
What
is
your
source
of
unbreakable
courage
and
will?”
–
IncognitoP
Xin
Zhao
indeed
possesses
unnatural
courage.
When
faced
with
adversity
that
would
send
most
men
fleeing,
Xin
Zhao
has
instead
charged
forward,
time
and
time
again.
His
valor
is
a
testament
to
the
strength
of
Demacian
warriors.
I
must
admit,
your
questioned
piqued
my
curiosity
as
well.
”People
often
mistake
what
is
truly
hard
in
life.
When
you
stand
toe
to
toe
against
any
enemy
on
the
field
of
battle,
options
are
stripped
away.
Fight
or
die.
If
you’ve
thought
about
giving
up,
you’re
probably
already
dead.
The
courage
that
Jarvan
II
taught
me
–
the
will
you
speak
of
–
was
the
courage
to
lead
men.
To
make
decisions
that
will
lead
to
the
deaths
of
friends,
and
to
stand
by
them
even
when
you
know
you
could
be
wrong.
Or
when
no
decision
is
right.
To
fight
and
die
is
easy
when
measured
against
this.
Whenever
things
seem
impossible,
I
need
only
to
remember
Jarvan
II.
That
man
would
do
anything
for
his
men,
and
they
would
do
anything
for
him,
myself
included,
without
regard
for
the
odds
or
the
consequences.
I
continue
to
serve
his
memory.”
“I'm
curious
if
the
origins
of
Olaf
and
Brand
could
give
us
heightened
insight
into
the
true
extent
of
the
Rune
Wars'
effects
on
our
world.
Have
there
been
any
efforts
to
talk
to
Olaf,
in
particular,
to
compare
histories
and
see
if
any
of
the
world-shaking
effects
of
the
Rune
Wars
had
repercussions
even
in
Olaf's
far
off
and
mysterious
continent
of
'
Lokfar
',
and
if
so,
what
were
they?
It
is
intriguing
to
think
that
our
own
lives
could
be
changed
by
an
event
which
occurred
in
a
place
we
didn't
even
know
existed.”
–
Tegan
Olaf,
since
he
arrived
at
the
League
of
Legends,
has
notoriously
withheld
information
about
Lokfar.
I
have
seen
firsthand
what
happens
when
someone
gets
too
nosy,
so
I
opted
to
speak
with
Brand.
He
isn’t
much
more
personable,
but
he
is
restrained.
”The
Rune
Wars?
I
don’t
much
care
for
the
affairs
of
you
creatures.
You
seem
to
believe
that
everything
that
has
transpired
on
the
world
has
done
so
for
or
because
of
you.
More
than
once
this
world
was
cleansed
by
the
purity
of
fire.
You
assume
this
is
bad,
but
the
world
you
live
in
today
was
a
product
of
that
purification.
Sometimes
the
slate
needs
to
be
wiped
clean.
The
fires
will
come
again,
whether
you
hide
behind
your
League
or
not.”
“To
Jarvan
:
As
an
avid
female
fan
of
yours,
I've
grown
quite
curious
about
a
certain
subject
that
may
concern
your
lifestyle.
As
Crown
Prince,
it's
your
job
to
one
day
take
the
throne
and
conceive
a
heir...
Is
there
a
certain
princess
that
you
have
your
eye
on,
or
someone
you
might
give
that
title
to
be
yours?
If
so,
would
we
ever
see
her
join
the
League
and
help
fight
at
your
side?
Your
love
life
is
something
this
summoner
has
grown
very
curious
about!”
–
xSeohyunx
Well
you
have
certainly
set
your
sights
high.
The
Crown
Prince
of
Demacia
is
one
of
the
most
powerful
men
on
Runeterra,
both
figuratively
and
literally.
With
all
his
time
spent
fighting,
I
wonder
what
thought
he
has
put
into
this
particular
matter.
“It
is
one
of
the
King’s
duties
to
produce
an
heir,
and
I
owe
it
to
my
family
to
continue
the
legacy
they
started.
In
my
travels
I
once
met…[Jarvan
here
went
silent
for
several
moments]…but
she
is
no
more.
I
have
not
afforded
much
attention
to
romantic
interests
as
of
late.
I
trust
that
when
the
right
woman
enters
my
life,
I
will
know
it.”
