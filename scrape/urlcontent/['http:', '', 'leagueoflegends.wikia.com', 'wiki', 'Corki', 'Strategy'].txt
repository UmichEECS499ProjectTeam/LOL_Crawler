Background

Trivia
Skill
usage
When
cast
on
a
group
of
enemy
minions,
Phosphorus
Bomb
along
with
Missile
Barrage
allows
Corki
to
farm
extremely
fast.
Phosphorus
Bomb
casts
quickly
and
does
good
burst
damage
for
a
lot
of
the
game.
It
can
be
used
to
harass
an
enemy
last-hitting
by
autoattacking
them
and
then
quickly
casting
Phosphorus
Bomb
.
Valkyrie
is
a
great
farming,
initiation,
and
escape
skill.
Use
it
wisely
due
to
its
long
cooldown.
Valkyrie
can
be
used
to
jump
over
terrain
and
walls
in
the
jungle
and
with
Flash
,
Corki
can
jump
over
2
walls
and
escape
most
ganks.
Since
Corki
is
a
squishy
AD
carry,
you
should
rarely
use
Valkyrie
offensively.
Use
it
to
keep
up
range
between
yourself
and
the
enemy.
Maximizing
the
damage
and
armor
reduction
of
Gatling
Gun
will
require
Corki
to
be
facing
and
attacking
the
target
constantly
for
its
four-second
duration.
It
must
be
activated
carefully
to
reach
its
full
potential.
The
armor
reduction
from
Gatling
Gun
will
be
removed
two
seconds
after
the
last
tick
of
damage
the
enemy
has
taken.
Corki
can
use
other
abilities
and
auto
attack
while
Gatling
Gun
is
active,
so
blast
away
with
Missile
Barrage
and
auto
attacks.
Always
watch
your
Missile
Barrage
quantity
before
entering
a
fight
so
you
don't
run
out
of
it
early.
If
possible,
prepare
a
Big
One.
(Have
at
least
2
stacks
towards
one.)
Remember
that
Missile
Barrage
is
an
AoE
skill,
and
it
doesn't
have
to
hit
the
enemy
champion
directly,
it
may
be
hit
onto
a
nearby
minion
for
the
same
damage.
The
Big
One
does
more
damage
and
has
a
larger
AoE
radius.
Build
usage
Because
of
the
increased
damage
from
his
passive,
getting
a
Doran's
Blade
at
the
beginning
of
the
game
allows
you
to
deal
a
lot
of
damage.
Starting
with
Boots
of
Speed
and
four
Health
Potions
will
give
you
more
sustain
and
mobility,
which
is
helpful
when
fighting
strong
poke
and
early
gankers.
Corki
scales
well
with
high
attack
damage,
so
try
to
build
an
early
Infinity
Edge
or
The
Bloodthirster
.
Getting
a
Manamune
helps
to
deal
with
Corki
's
mana
costs.
However,
it
sacrifices
late-game
DPS.
Trinity
Force
is
a
key
item
for
Corki
because
a
Sheen
proc
can
be
frequently
achieved
using
Missile
Barrage
and
then
apply
it
with
auto
attacks.
This
will
strengthen
mid
to
late
game
damage
output
(with
a
200%
boost
to
your
base
auto-attack)
and
provides
some
utility
and
survivability.
Building
typical
attack
damage
items
on
Corki
works
well
with
his
skills.
Valkyrie
allows
him
to
keep
up
range
and
be
relatively
safe
while
Hextech
Shrapnel
Shells
and
Gatling
Gun
will
increase
his
damage
output
greatly.
Building
Phantom
Dancer
or
Statikk
Shiv
early
is
not
a
good
idea,
as
Corki
benefits
more
from
building
attack
damage
.
Corki
benefits
more
from
magic
penetration
than
armor
penetration
his
spells
have
efficient
synergy
with
attack
damage
and
deal
mostly
magic
damage
.
Items
such
as
Sorcerer's
Shoes
and
Haunting
Guise
are
recommended.
Because
Hextech
Shrapnel
Shells
deals
true
damage
,
Liandry's
Torment
is
another
choice
item
for
Corki
as
Phosphorus
Bomb
and
Missile
Barrage
have
long
range
and
large
hit-boxes
while
Valkyrie
and
Gatling
Gun
deals
DoT
,
making
Corki
great
for
kiting
using
Liandry's
Torment
's
passive
to
burn
a
large
portion
of
enemy
health
.
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
can
provide
some
utility
and
crowd
control
,
but
it
sacrifices
some
of
his
overall
damage.

Countering
Try
to
stay
away
from
the
AoE
of
his
Gatling
Gun
.
It
can
reduce
your
armor
heavily
if
you
are
careless.
Try
to
pressure
Corki
while
he
is
using
it.
Making
him
turn
around
to
kite
will
cause
him
to
waste
part
of
it.
Although
Corki
has
a
great
lane
dominance,
he
is
fairly
squishy.
Work
with
your
lane
partner
to
harass
him
often
and/or
kill
him
early.
Focus
Corki
down
if
he
leads
the
battle
with
his
Valkyrie
.
When
chasing
him,
do
not
overextend
as
his
Valkyrie
can
help
him
outrun
you.
Stay
away
from
the
minion
wave
when
he
uses
his
Missile
Barrage
.
The
spell
deals
AoE
damage
even
when
it
hits
minions.
Moving
erratically
also
helps
with
dodging
Missile
Barrage
.
Always
try
to
be
behind
minions
when
Corki
starts
firing
Missile
Barrage
as
it
can
do
tons
of
damage
with
certain
items
like
Trinity
Force
or
The
Bloodthirster
.
