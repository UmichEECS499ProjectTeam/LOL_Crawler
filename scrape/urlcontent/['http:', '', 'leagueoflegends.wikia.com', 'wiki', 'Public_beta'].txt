Public

For
the
current
list
of
changes
and
new
features
active
in
the
PBE,
see:
here
.
The
Public
Beta
Environment
,
or
PBE
is
a
"test-centric"
server
on
which
upcoming
patches
are
available
for
public
testing.
[1]
This
allows
Riot
Games
to
fix
any
bugs
before
the
patch
is
released
to
the
rest
of
the
world.
Players
can
test
new
champions
and
features
before
they
are
publicly
released.
This
is
an
invaluable
resource
for
Riot,
as
public
testing
saves
time
and
resources
as
well
as
providing
fun
new
opportunities
for
players.
Additionally,
players
on
the
PBE
are
given
practically
unlimited
IP
and
RP.
This
allows
players
to
purchase
and
use
any
champion,
skin,
or
other
feature
in
the
game
on
the
testing
servers.
While
not
necessarily
for
what
the
PBE
was
intended,
this
allows
players
to
try
out
champions
and
skins
before
buying
them
on
their
actual
accounts.
This
can
be
a
valuable
tool
in
making
a
well-informed
purchase
that
the
player
won't
regret.
