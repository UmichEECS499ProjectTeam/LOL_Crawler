Promote
was
a
summoner
spell
in
League
of
Legends
available
on
Summoner's
Rift
,
Twisted
Treeline
and
Crystal
Scar
.
Now
a
similar

of
this
spell
can
be
done
with
the
item
Banner
of
Command
,
but
only
on
cannon
minions.

Strategy
When
most
enemy
champions
are
focusing
on
one
lane
or
capture
point,
you
can
promote
the
minion
in
the
other
lane
and
head
the
other
way.
This
strategy
works
on
those
opponents
who
only
scan
the
champion
icon
on
the
mini-map,
thus
they
are
likely
ignorant
of
the
threat
of
the
anti-turret
cannon
because
it
is
not
specially
emphasized
on
the
mini-map.
Classic
Unlike
in
Dominion
mode,
Promote
in
Classic
mode
does
NOT
fully
recover
the
minion's
health,
but
gives
it
a
slightly
higher
percentage
of
remaining
health
than
its
pre-Promote
form.
As
such,
a
player
should
activate
Promote
immediately
as
long
as
the
spell
is
ready
and
the
siege
minion
is
nearby.
Casting
Promote
on
a
siege
minion
used
to
grant
the
following
buffs:
Buffs
attack
speed
50%,

5
attacks
per
second

+

Magic
Resist

(Champion

Health
Dominion
It
is
advisable
to
Promote
a
super
minion
that
is
near
death,
so
its
health
may
be
fully
recovered,
therefore
utilizing
the
full
potential
of
the
summoner
spell.
The
anti-turret
cannon
is
a
great
neutralizing
unit.
For
best
results,
a
player
can
voluntarily
stand
right
next
to
the
enemy
minion
spawn
point.
In
order
to
attract
the
next
minion
wave
so
it
does
not
slow
the
promoted
minion's
march
towards
the
enemy
capture
point
.
Do
not
promote
a
super
minion
that
is
heading
to
the
nearby
allied
capture
point,
unless
that
point
is
going
to
be
neutralized
by
the
enemy
immediately.
If
the
destination
is
void
of
battle,
the
minion
will
simply
die
to
the
nearby
spawn
point.
Pay
attention
if
there
is
more
than
one
super
minion
nearby.
Move
closer
to
the
super
minion
you
want
to
promote
(with
lower
health
and
marching
to
the
enemy
capture
point)
before
activating
the
spell.
Notes
The
super
minion
spawned
by
destroying
an
enemy
inhibitor
in
classic
mode
cannot
be
promoted.
The
promoted
minion
will
give
its
host
gold
and
score
upon
getting
a
kill,
but
not
experience
if
the
host
stands
too
far
from
the
slain
enemy.
Note
that
if
there
are
two
siege
minions
in
the
vicinity,
Promote
will
be
used
on
the
closest
one,
regardless
of
if
it
has
been
promoted
already.
This
may
result
in
wasting
Promote
on
an
already
promoted
siege
minion.
Kills
by
a
promoted
minion
do
not
trigger
Twisted
Fate's
Loaded
Dice
and
the
passive
from
Ashe's
Hawkshot
.
Promote
was
originally
a
summoner
spell
for
the
Classic
mode
which
metamorphosed
a
regular
minion
into
a
siegerider
.
However,
it
was
later
removed
along
with
the
siegerider
in
the
V1.0.0.63
patch
due
to
abuse
in
Promote
stacking,
resulting
in
unstoppable
pushes.
This
is
no
longer
an
issue
since
promote
will
now
only
promote
siege
minions.
