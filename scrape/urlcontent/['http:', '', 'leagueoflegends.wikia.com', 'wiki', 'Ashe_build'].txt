Skill
usage
Focus
will
allow
you
to
land
a
guaranteed
critical
strike
on
your
first
shot
of
the
game.
Choose
whether
to
use
it
on
a
champion
or
a
minion
.
This
shot
in
conjunction
with
Volley
can
provide
substantial
burst
damage
and
give
you
the
edge
in
a
level
one
engagement.
If
you
are
having
mana
problems
then
alternating
Frost
Shot
so
it
only
activates
every
2nd
attack
might
help
conserve
mana
while
constantly
applying
the
slow.
Ashe's
Frost
Shots
apply
the
slow
effect
if
the
skill
is
active
when
the
arrow
hits.
That
means
you
can
shoot
an
attack
when
the
skill
is
not
active,
and
toggle
it
while
the
arrow
is
mid
flight.
When
facing
melee
champions
,
it
is
highly
advisable
for
Ashe
to
'kite'
her
opponents
via
her
Frost
Shot
.
The
'kiting'
tactic
works
even
better
if
you
manage
to
stutter
step
(cancel
your
attacks
wind-down
animation)
while
doing
it.
Ashe's
Frost
Shot
makes
Ashe
much
less
reliant
on
the
Blessing
of
the
Lizard
Elder
than
most
other
marksmen.
Keep
in
mind
that
champions
with
dash
abilities
can
counter
this
tactic.
Volley
has
a
fairly
large
cone
and
decent
damage
early/mid
game.
Use
this
to
your
advantage
by
positioning
yourself
to
last
hit
minions
and
harass
the
enemy
champions
with
it.
Avoid
spamming
it
early
game
as
you
most
likely
end
up
pushing
the
minions
to
the
enemy
tower.
Volley
diminishes
quickly
in
the
late
game;
however,
it
still
provides
a
great
deal
of
utility.
Volley
can
slow
a
great
majority
of
the
enemy
team,
can
still
be
used
between
autoattacks,
hit
enemy
chasing/retreating
in
bushes
and
it
can
pop
Banshee's
Veil
s.
Use
Hawkshot
to
check
the
nearby
jungle
for
enemies
that
may
be
attempting
to
gank
you.
It
is
also
useful
to
check
if
the
enemy
is
fighting
the
Dragon
or
Baron
Nashor
from
a
distance.
If
your
team
is
engaging
either
of
those
monsters,
Hawkshot
will
give
you
advance
notice
of
enemy
approach,
but
also
inform
them
of
your
general
location.
You
can
use
Enchanted
Crystal
Arrow
to
help
your
allies
from
another
lane
.
If
your
allies
have
the
advantage,
shoot
it
further
up
their
enemies'
lane,
and
if
not,
aim
further
down
your
allies'
lane.
This
may
help
your
allies
the
opportunity
to
strike
a
killing
blow
or
make
a
getaway.
Keep
in
mind
that
there
is
a
low
chance
you'll
hit
them
and
you
lose
a
lot
of
lane
control
if
your
opponent
knows
it's
on
cooldown.
Enchanted
Crystal
Arrow
is
one
of
the
best
initiators
in
the
game,
able
to
stun
an
enemy
(preferably
someone
squishy)
from
a
distance.
Enchanted
Crystal
Arrow
is
also
a
great
skill
for
ganking.
A
well
aimed
arrow
can
stun
the
target
long
enough
for
you
or
your
jungler
to
apply
their
CC
as
well.
Furthermore,
Ashe's
passive
usually
guarantees
a
critical
hit
if
she
has
been
traveling
between
lanes.
Enchanted
Crystal
Arrow
is
also
a
great
skill
when
your
opponents
are
losing
the
match
and
are
running/escaping.
Using
it
at
the
right
moment
can
slow
the
whole
team
down,
grabbing
yourself
an
ace.
When
shooting
Enchanted
Crystal
Arrow
towards
another
lane
ping
the
area
it
will
hit.
This
will
alert
your
teammates
that
you
have
shot
your
ultimate.
Don't
be
afraid
to
use
Enchanted
Crystal
Arrow
to
escape.
However,
be
aware
that
the
duration
of
the
stun
is
based
upon
how
far
the
arrow
has
traveled
before
impact.
Try
to
fire
Enchanted
Crystal
Arrow
in
the
same
direction
enemies
are
moving,
so
it
is
more
likely
to
land
a
hit.
It
has
a
surprisingly
large
hitbox.
Enchanted
Crystal
Arrow
is
very
powerful
in
Dominion
,
as
the
enemy
champion's
attempted
capture
would
be
interrupted
while
they
are
being
stunned
for
3.5
seconds
and
repeatedly
shot
at
by
the
turret.
Ashe
is
one
of
the
weakest
1v1
characters
in
the
game
when
she
decides
to
stand
and
fight.
Assuming
your
opponent
is
equal
to
you
in
gold,
Ashe
is
outdamaged
by
nearly
every
other
ranged
AD
character,
quickly
assassinated
by
nukers/bruisers
if
caught
out
of
position,
and
heavily
CC'd
by
tanks
that
she
takes
a
long
time
to
kill.
Her
strength
heavily
relies
on
her
ability
to
kite
enemies
and
punish
enemies
out
of
position
in
team
fights
with
her
slow.
Build
usage
Stacking
2
Doran's
Blades
early
game
gives
Ashe
a
much
stronger
lane
presence,
and
are
later
sold
for
stronger
items.
Ashe
is
a
standard
ranged
carry
and
should
be
built
accordingly.
Rushing
Infinity
Edge
is
a
very
strong
choice
and
generally
considered
the
best
way
to
build
Ashe
.
If
your
enemy
is
stacking
armor,
try
to
get
a
Last
Whisper
in
your
item
build.
Phantom
Dancer
or
Statikk
Shiv
on
Ashe
synergizes
well
with
the
Infinity
Edge
.
Your
attack
damage
will
be
somewhere
around
the
130-150
mark
with
a
Doran's
Blade
.
Statikk
Shiv
synergizes
extremely
well
with
Ashe
because
of
Focus
:
As
it
can
critically
strike,
staying
out
of
combat
long
enough
will
transform
the
next
auto-attack
into
an
hybrid
physical/magical
burst.
Banshee's
Veil
is
extremely
good
when
fighting
enemies
with
strong
crowd
control
.
It
grants
her
far
more
durability
from
her
natural
squishiness.
Other
possible
items
are
Zephyr
for
the
Tenacity
and
overall
good
statistics
and
Mercurial
Scimitar
that
give
both
a
good
attack
damage
bonus
and
the
Cleanse
-like
active.
Building
Ashe
as
support
is
not
ineffective
as
she
does
have
a
low
damage
output.
Building
auras
and
cooldown
reduction
is
an
extremely
effective
way
to
play
her.
With
her
perma-slow,
cone
slow,
vision,
global
stun,
and
requirement
to
be
in
the
back
during
a
team
fight,
she
can
do
just
fine
supporting
her
team.
Runaan's
Hurricane
lets
Ashe
apply
Frost
Shot
s
on
up
to
3
targets.
Even
though,
it
is
not
recommended
since
Volley
can
apply
a
similar
effect
in
a
higher
range
and
to
a
larger
amount
of
targets.
Ashe
has
mediocre
movement
speed.
Buying
a
pair
of
Boots
of
Speed
early
game
can
help
her
with
this,
and
later,
once
you
leave
lane,
consider
upgrading
this
item
for
a
Berserker's
Greaves
or
Boots
of
Swiftness
to
help
her
escape
and
chase
even
better.
Boots
of
Swiftness
is
highly
recommended
for
three
reasons,
the
difference
in
move
speed
is
quite
noticeable
(and
very
much
appreciated
by
such
a
"slow"
champion),
the
unique
effect
of
Boots
of
Swiftness
is
VERY
useful
(As
slows
are
THE
most
common
CC),
and
the
minor
Attack
Speed
bonus
that
Berserker's
Greaves
gives
is
relatively
negligible,
and
better
built
elsewhere.
Simply
put,
you
get
a
lot
more
bang
for
your
buck
with
Boots
of
Swiftness
.

Countering
Beware
of
Ashe's
kiting
capability.
Her
Frost
Shot
combined
with
Volley
will
keep
you
from
reaching
her.
Randuin's
Omen
along
with
movement
speed
items
can
help
counter
her
kiting.
Ashe
mainly
deals
damage
by
using
auto-attacks,
so
buying
Thornmail
can
help
counter
or
even
kill
if
she
has
low
health.
Although
Ashe
is
a
great
harasser
during
the
laning
phase,
her
low
health
is
a
great
disadvantage.
Putting
pressure
on
her
can
keep
her
zoned
.
Ashe
is
an
unusual
ADC,
lacking
any
form
of
attack
damage
or
attack
speed
steroid,
however,
Ashe
strength
relies
in
something
that
almost
every
other
ADC
lacks
or
has
mediocrity:
Utility
,
Enchanted
Crystal
Arrow
alone
packs
a
stun,
something
unique
and
very
rare
for
ADCs,
as
well
as
having
a
sort
of
Frozen
Mallet
in
Frost
Shot
.
Due
to
this
Ashe
's
ability
to
gank
or
assist
in
a
gank
is
the
best
for
any
ADC
in
game,
watch
out
if
paired
with
strong
gankers
such
as
Hecarim
or
Nautilus
as
they
will
simply
CC
lock
you
until
you
die.
If
Ashe
starts
to
chain
attack
you
with
Frost
Shot
,
you
will
most
likely
not
be
able
to
escape
if
you
lack
a
dash
or
a
blink
(even
with
those,
fear
the
Enchanted
Crystal
Arrow
).
Being
tied
for
the
lowest
movement
speed
for
champions
in
the
game
leaves
Ashe
vulnerable
to
skillshots.
Ashe
has
little
to
no
defensive
capabilities.
Use
this
to
your
advantage.
However,
she
can
slow
you
constantly
as
long
as
she
has
mana
,
so
wait
before
she
is
low
before
you
go
in
to
kill.
Gap-closers
can
quickly
take
advantage
of
this,
since
her
slows
cannot
counter
them.
Watch
for
when
Ashe
uses
her
Hawkshot
.
This
tells
what
part
of
the
map
her
team
has
no
vision
of.
At
the
same
time,
beware
for
the
inverse.
You
might
be
tricked
into
thinking
an
area
is
unwarded
because
she
just
used
her
Hawkshot
,
while
it
was
just
used
to
lure
you
there
after
the
effects
wore
off.
The
most
unique
part
of
Ashe
's
kit
is
Enchanted
Crystal
Arrow
,
giving
her
a
significant
nuke
and
much
appreciated
hard
CC
(for
an
ADC
this
is
extremely
rare),
simultaneously,
she
is
quite
dependent
on
her
ultimate,
so
if
you
force
her
to
burn
it
for
an
escape
she
is
loosing
a
large
portion
of
her
power
and
ganking
abilities
