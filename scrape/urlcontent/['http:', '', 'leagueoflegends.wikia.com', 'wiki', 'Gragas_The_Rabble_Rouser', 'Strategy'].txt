Skill
usage
Barrel
Roll
is
strong
for
harassing
the
enemy
and
farming
minions
due
to
its
high
damage.
However,
when
cast
from
afar,
its
travel
time
is
noticeably
one
of
the
slowest
in
the
game
and
it
can
only
be
detonated
upon
landing
at
the
targeted
location.
A
good
way
to
predict
the
enemy's
location
to
deal
with
this
is
in
expectation
of
the
enemy
last-hitting
-
the
animations
that
all
champions
must
go
through
to
autoattack
forces
them
to
stand
still.
Using
Barrel
Roll
can
deal
lots
of
damage
to
a
single
target,
if
you
cast
it
where
you
expect
them
to
run
while
you
are
chasing
them
then
use
Body
Slam
and
detonate
the
barrel
at
the
same
time,
it
can
deal
a
massive
amount
of
damage,
the
barrel
is
also
easier
to
land
since
the
enemy
will
be
running
in
one
way
most
of
the
time.
The
buff
from
Drunken
Rage
is
applied
at
the
end
of
the
channel,
ensure
that
you
can
safely
channel
before
entering
into
fight.
Drunken
Rage
should
be
used
often.
It
is
has
no
cost,
restores
mana
,
and
the
additional
attack
damage
helps
farm
minions.
With
at
least
20%
cooldown
reduction
,
it
can
be
active
permanently,
as
it
lasts
20
seconds
with
a
25
second
cooldown.
Gragas's
natural
tankiness
and
decent
physical
damage
allows
him
to
stay
in
team
fights
to
make
use
of
his
damage
absorption
and
attack
damage
increase
from
Drunken
Rage
.
Body
Slam
has
a
number
of
utilities:
slowing
your
target(s),
farming
minions,
escaping
ganks,
or
running
through
thin
walls.
Body
Slam
deals
a
lot
of
damage
when
used
on
a
single
target,
similar
to
Karthus's
Lay
Waste
,
so
try
to
use
it
when
an
enemy
champion
is
isolated
from
his
minions
if
you
can.
Use
Explosive
Cask
to
knock
enemies
into
your
towers
or
your
team.
Explosive
Cask
is
great
for
disrupting
the
enemy
during
team
fights,
splitting
the
team
up/allowing
you
to
chase
down
one
enemy.
Explosive
Cask
can
be
used
to
interrupt
or
move
enemies
channeling
spells
such
as
Fiddlesticks's
Crowstorm
.
It
is
similar
to
Janna's
Monsoon
and
will
stop
suppressions
such
as
Warwick's
Infinite
Duress
.
A
good
conservative
strategy
with
Gragas
during
laning
is
alternating
between
Barrel
Roll
and
Drunken
Rage
to
constantly
regenerate
mana
and
health
.
Gragas
is
a
strong
solo
lane
champion,
due
to
his
sustain
from
Drunken
Rage
and
Happy
Hour
.
Happy
Hour
does
not
stack,
only
refresh.
Try
to
space
your
abilities
out
to
maximize
the
sustain
from
it.
Activating
Body
Slam
,
followed
by
Drunken
Rage
while
traveling
allows
you
to
channel
during
the
movement.
This
improves
your
efficiency.
With
enough
cooldown
reduction
,
Barrel
Roll
can
be
used
almost
non-stop,
as
the
cooldown
is
almost
as
short
as
the
casting
animation
and
time
to
line
up
the
explosion
right.
Drunken
Rage
gives
Gragas
a
lot
of
attack
damage
and
damage
reduction.
Despite
usually
being
built
with
AP
,
this
can
allow
him
to
aggressively
autoattack
ranged
champions
in
lane
that
are
vulnerable
in
melee
by
using
Body
Slam
to
get
close.
Getting
close
to
your
target
that
way
also
makes
Barrel
Roll
travel
to
its
destination
faster
and
be
an
easy
hit.
Explosive
Cask
can
be
used
to
knock
enemies
into
a
barrel
from
Barrel
Roll
,
then
detonating
Barrel
Roll
when
they
land
on
it,
dealing
heavy
damage.
Build
usage
Gragas
relies
on
the
three
major
magic
damage
statistics,
ability
power
,
cooldown
reduction
,
and
magic
penetration
,
to
increase
his
DPS.
Items
that
grant
these
stats
should
be
prioritized.
Spell
vamp
items
like
Will
of
the
Ancients
are
viable
on
Gragas
,
as
they
improve
his
damage
and
sustain.
As
enemies
build
magic
resistance
,
magic
penetration
items
like
Void
Staff
are
needed
to
increase
Gragas's
magic
damage
.
Gragas's
base
damage
and
AP
scaling
means
he
can
be
an
effective
burst
mage.
AP
items
such
as
Rabadon's
Deathcap
and
Zhonya's
Hourglass
are
best
for
this.
Deathfire
Grasp
or
Lich
Bane
can
increase
his
burst
even
further.
Deathfire
Grasp
magic
damage
passive
is
better
in
a
full
ability
power
build
while
Lich
Bane
's
autoattack
passive,
on
the
other
hand,
is
more
useful
in
a
tanky
AP
build.
Cooldown
reduction
items
are
powerful
on
Gragas
.
Athene's
Unholy
Grail
and
Deathfire
Grasp
are
great
ability
power
and
cooldown
reduction
items
.
Frozen
Heart
is
very
useful
in
a
tanky
AP
build
as
every
stat
it
gives,
mana
,
armor
,
and
cooldown
reduction
is
beneficial
to
Gragas
.
Shurelya's
Reverie
is
a
useful
aura
item
.
But
because
it
doesn't
offer
anything
offensive
besides
cooldown
reduction
or
defensive
besides
health
,
it
is
a
situtational
choice.
If
you
build
Gragas
with
a
tanky
AP
build,
Consider
buying
item
such
as
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
,
Rod
of
Ages
,
Frozen
Heart
or
Abyssal
Scepter
.
Take
note
that
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
might
not
be
the
best
choice.
Because
Gragas
's
damaging
abilities
are
all
area
of
effect
spells,
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
only
grants
a
15%
movement
speed
slow
and
Body
Slam
is
already
a
movement
speed
slow.
Gragas
is
very
viable
as
a
full
tank.
Consider
health
,
armor
,
and
magic
resistance
for
synergy
with
Happy
Hour
and
Drunken
Rage
.
Try
getting
Randuin's
Omen
and
Glacial
Shroud
for
great
armor
boost
and
cooldown
reduction
.
For
magic
resistance
and
cooldown
reduction
,
you
can
get
Spirit
Visage
.
The
boost
to
healing
does
work
with
his
Happy
Hour
,
however,
it
is
virtually
non-existant
and
should
not
be
the
primary
incentive
for
picking
up
this
item
.
Warmog's
Armor
combined
with
Happy
Hour
can
give
Gragas
a
lot
of
survivability
in
the
form
of
health
regeneration
in
a
fight.

Gragas
has
a
very
powerful
lane
dominance
during
laning
phase.
Be
careful
not
to
get
zoned
by
him.
Interupting
him
from
completing
the
channel
of
his
Drunken
Rage
will
help
you
take
him
down
quickly.
Take
cover
behind
a
minion
to
avoid
his
Body
Slam
or
reduce
its
damage.
Body
Slam
can
be
vulnerable
to
skillshots
while
traveling
to
its
location.
If
you
can
predict
when
Gragas
will
use
it,
such
as
through
a
wall,
you
can
get
an
easy
hit
with
a
skillshot.
When
you
are
near
his
turret
range,
be
careful
of
Gragas's
Explosive
Cask
as
it
may
knock
you
back
to
his
turret.
