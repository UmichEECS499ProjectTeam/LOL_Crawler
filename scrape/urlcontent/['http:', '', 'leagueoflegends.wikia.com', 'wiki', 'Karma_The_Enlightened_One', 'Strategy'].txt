Skill
usage
In
order
to
play
Karma
effectively,
you
must
know
when
to
use
a
Mantra
charge.
Mantra
on
Inner
Flame
creates
Soulflare
,
Karma
's
most
powerful
and
dangerous
ability,
as
it
one
of
the
most
powerful
nukes
in
game
(has
both
spectacular
base
damage
and
AP
ratio)
and
should
be
used
in
teamfights.
It's
also
the
most
important
part
of
Karma
's
combo
into
a
single
target.
Mantra
on
Focused
Resolve
creates
Renewal
which
can
strongly
heal
yourself
in
combat
and
cripple
a
fleeing
enemy.
However,
the
heal
is
not
very
good
unless
your
health
is
under
50%,
but
you
can
use
it
and
follow
up
with
Inspire
to
protect
Karma
while
she
heals.
It
also
deals
a
lot
of
damage
compared
to
any
other
DoT
in
the
game.
Using
Mantra
on
Inspire
creates
Defiance
,
a
potent
AoE
shield
and
haste
which
is
useful
to
help
an
ally
surrounded
by
enemies,
as
the
shield
strength
and
haste
are
huge.
It
can
be
used
for
AoE
damage
but
mainly
to
provide
durability
and
haste
to
your
team.
It
can
also
be
used
to
absorb
a
large
portion
of
an
AoE
ability
that
you
see
incoming,
as
the
shield
itself
is
AoE.
Of
her
skills,
Inner
Flame
and
Soulflare
have
the
lowest
mana
cost
and
cooldown,
making
it
easy
to
reduce
Mantra
's
cooldown
faster.
Take
into
account
that
Focused
Resolve
reduces
Mantra
's
by
6
seconds
alone.
Remember
that
Soulflare
,
Defiance
,
Renewal
effects
are
independent
to
their
normal
counterpart
ranks,
for
example,
a
support
Karma
can
still
deal
a
lot
of
damage
using
Soulflare
while
Inner
Flame
is
at
rank
one,
while
a
maxed
Inspire
will
offer
mediocre
damage
as
Defiance
compared
to
Soulflare
.
Even
so,
take
into
account
that
a
higher
ranked
ability
will
of
course
feel
more
powerful
than
a
lower
ranked
one
when
empowered.
Karma
's
rework
was
centered
around
allowing
her
to
be
a
mage,
which
was
successful.
Karma
's
main
combo
is:
Land
Inner
Flame
;
if
you
miss
it,
think
twice
before
following
up.
Wait
until
Inner
Flame
CD
has
dropped
to
2
seconds
(Really
easy
with
40%
CDR).
Use
Focused
Resolve
and
land
the
snare.
T
his
is
critical,
as
missing
the
snare
can
ruin
the
combo.
Mantra
-->
Soulflare
;
Soulflare
is
thrown
right
into
your
snared
victim,
shutting
down
any
possible
escape
from
the
secondary
zone
Use
Inspire
any
time
you
see
a
counter-attack
heading
your
way,
to
either
dodge
it
with
the
bonus
movement
speed,
or
to
shield
yourself
from
damage.
Karma
's
kit
is
quite
versatile,
and
you
should
think
carefully
about
which
ability
to
max,
depending
on
the
situation.
As
her
main
source
of
damage,
harassment
and
burst,
Inner
Flame
should
be
maxed
out
if
you
are
taking
a
solo
lane
or
decide
to
become
a
severe
poking
support.
Despite
her
rework,
Karma
is
still
a
support
and
Inspire
is
a
beefy,
low
cooldown
and
mana-affordable
shield
with
a
potent
haste.
If
you
decide
to
run
Karma
as
a
support,
it
would
be
wise
to
be
maxing
this
ability
first.
However,
it
should
be
maxed
last
if
playing
as
a
mage,
as
it
provides
an
impressive
40%
movement
speed
boost
at
rank
one,
making
it
a
one
point
wonder.
This
gives
Karma
both
increased
mobility
and
saving
power.
Providing
a
good
amount
of
damage
and
useful
CC,
Focused
Resolve
is
not
to
be
ignored.
However,
its
short
range
can
make
it
troublesome
to
use
properly,
and
maxing
this
ability
can
waste
a
lot
of
damage.
If
you
are
facing
a
melee
opponent
like
Riven
or
Jax
,
who
needs
to
be
up
your
face
to
deal
damage
to
you,
the
root
can
be
an
excellent
disengage.
Also,
in
most
scenarios
you'll
easily
be
able
to
trigger
the
snare.
If
having
trouble
sticking
to
a
target
long
enough
to
trigger
the
root
of
Focused
Resolve
,
slow
your
opponents
with
Inner
Flame
and/or
speed
yourself
up
with
Inspire
.
Gathering
Fire
is
very
useful
during
laning
phase,
but
becomes
especially
powerful
in
teamfights.
In
teamfights,
where
you
most
likely
have
a
high
amount
CDR,
Mantra
's
cooldown
is
drastically
lowered
by
Gathering
Fire
,
as
Soulflare
can
trigger
multiple
times,
and
can
be
spammed
more
often
due
to
the
CDR.
Karma
can
allow
incredibly
powerful
escapes
for
her
allies
as
well
as
herself:
Using
Focused
Resolve
and
Inner
Flame
on
a
chasing
opponent
will
cripple
them
down.
Using
the
massive
haste,
as
well
as
shield
from
Defiance
,
Karma
can
swiftly
get
an
ally
out
of
danger.
Karma
's
early
game
power
is
surprisingly
high
due
to
her
high
base
damages,
and
the
fact
that
she
can
use
Mantra
at
level
1
to
empower
her
abilities.
A
Focused
Resolve
into
Soulflare
combo
can
easily
do
up
to
50%
of
your
opponent's
health
early
on.
The
cooldown
of
Mantra
starts
when
activated,
not
when
the
enhanced
spell
is
cast.
Activating
Mantra
in
advance
of
an
imminent
fight
can
theoretically
save
you
up
to
8
seconds
of
cooldown
on
the
ability.
In
top
lane
Karma
functions
well
by
kiting
and
zoning
AD
tank
champions
with
auto
attacks
and
abilities.
Inner
Flame
taken
at
level
1
allows
her
to
zone
effectively
and
taking
Focused
Resolve
at
level
2
both
allows
her
full
damage
combo
and
excellent
disengage.
Karma
can
burst
easily
at
low
levels,
but
tends
to
win
top
lane
through
forcing
her
laner
to
back
due
to
harass
and
kiting.
This
also
benefits
karma
due
to
the
ability
to
get
more
use
out
of
her
passive.
Karma
is
a
support
jungler,
utilizing
her
kit
to
gank
early
with
high
burst
and
CC,
and
later
allowing
her
team
to
engage
and
disengage
well
in
teamfights
as
well
as
laying
down
considerable
burst
damage
while
CC'ing
targets.
Taking
Inner
Flame
first
and
Inspire
second
allows
karma
to
farm
decently.
At
level
3
your
whole
kit
will
allow
you
to
gank
effectively.
Karma
's
skill
order
in
ganking
is
casting
Inner
Flame
into
her
target
and
Inspire
on
herself
or
her
laner
to
gap
close,
tethering
her
target
with
Focused
Resolve
,
and
then
using
Mantra
to
cast
Soulflare
to
burst
and
slow
the
target
for
a
kill
by
the
laner.
Keep
in
mind
while
ganking,
holding
lane,
or
being
caught
in
an
early
duel
that
auto
attacking
your
target
will
greatly
reduce
the
cooldown
of
Mantra
,
and
that
Renewal
will
make
you
deceptively
tanky
for
an
early
fight
and
in
some
cases
allow
you
to
engage
and
gain
health
during
the
fight.
Build
usage
Karma's
abilities
can
make
her
deceptively
tanky.
However
since
this
tankiness
comes
from
active
abilities
she
is
especially
vulnerable
while
stunned
or
silenced,
making
Mercury's
Treads
and
Banshee's
Veil
good
options
when
the
other
team
has
a
lot
of
CC
.
As
explained
above;
Karma's
has
quite
a
powerful
burst,
usually
enough
to
blow
up
any
ADC
(which
is
usually
the
job
of
a
mage)
but
can't
bring
tanky
fighters
under
30-45%
of
their
health.
The
Deathfire
Grasp
with
the
initial
nuke
and
increased
damage
can
help
with
this
problem,
and
the
CDR
is
extremely
useful
for
her.
Tear
of
the
Goddess
can
be
build
early
to
solve
any
mana
problems
and
quickly
rushed
to
Archangel's
Staff
to
charge
it
faster.
Couple
with
items
as
Rod
of
Ages
it
can
give
over
130
ability
power,
not
to
mention
that
Karma's
's
mana
pool
is
quite
large.
Karma's
benefits
greatly
from
cooldown
reduction
,
which
paired
with
Gathering
Fire
can
burn
the
cooldown
of
Mantra
in
a
couple
of
seconds
in
a
teamfight
and
can
allows
the
use
of
your
ultimate
up
to
3
times
if
you
are
really
aggressive.
Karma's
is
quite
mana-hungry
because
of
the
spammish
nature
of
Inner
Flame
,
due
to
this
the
Morellonomicon
allows
her
to
sustain
her
damage
and
improve
it's
spammy
nature,
as
well
as
providing
a
good
deal
of
AP
Another
option
is
Athene's
Unholy
Grail
,
however,
keep
in
mind
that
when
you
buy
yourself
a
Grail
a
large
deal
of
gold
is
poured
on
the
defensive
stat.
This
is
quite
more
expensive
than
the
Morellonomicon
and
does
not
provide
as
much
as
AP
as
the
Book.
The
mana
regeneration
offered
by
this
item
is
also
a
bit
too
high
for
the
likes
of
Karma's
Any
of
these
items
combined
with
sorcery
and
Ionian
Boots
of
Lucidity
will
allow
her
to
achieve
40%
CDR,
which
is
quite
critical
on
her.
Inner
Flame
is
her
main
source
of
damage
all
game
long,
and
it
happens
to
apply
a
slow,
which
instantly
procs
the
improved
burn
of
Liandry's
Torment
,
not
to
mention
that
it
gives
the
magic
penetration
that
she
is
likely
to
sacrifice
by
getting
Ionian
Boots
of
Lucidity
instead
of
Sorcerer's
Shoes
,
and
the
bonus
health
is
quite
high,
considering
she
has
to
get
really
close
to
deal
damage
Building
Zhonya's
Hourglass
and
Abyssal
Scepter
will
not
only
provide
more
durability
for
Karma
,
but
additional
AP
as
well.
Remember
that
to
deal
full
damage
Karma's
must
land
her
snare,
this
means
that
she
has
to
be
pretty
close
to
her
target.
Tanky
AP
items
like
Zhonya's
Hourglass
,
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
or
Rod
of
Ages
are
highly
recommended
on
her.
Consider
buying
a
Zeke's
Herald
if
you're
playing
support.
This
aura
is
powerful
for
teamfights.
Having
excellent
ratios
on
her
abilities
(especially
when
Mantra
is
on
them)
Rabadon's
Deathcap
is
a
must
if
playing
as
mage,
and
even
as
support
it
can
be
useful
if
your
team
lacks
burst.
Top
lane
will
generally
require
Karma
to
rush
an
early
Chalice
of
Harmony
and
then
a
Seeker's
Armguard
to
allow
for
constant
mana
and
then
to
counter
AD
damage
and
grant
some
AP.
Either
Athene's
Unholy
Grail
or
Morellonomicon
is
recommended
due
to
the
fact
that
having
mana
and
all
your
abilities
off
cooldown
will
vastly
improve
Karma's
zoning
and
kyting
potential,
as
well
as
making
her
much
harder
to
gank.
Due
to
the
changes
to
Spirit
Stone
Karma
is
much
more
viable
in
jungle
now.
In
jungle
Karma
benefits
most
from
early
mana
regen
items
with
CDR,
such
as
Athene's
Unholy
Grail
or
Morellonomicon
.
The
CDR
is
necessary
for
clear
time
and
to
improve
early
dueling
potential.
AP
is
also
recommended
to
allow
her
damage
to
keep
up
in
mid
game.
Sorcerer's
Shoes
and
Haunting
Guise
will
provide
Karma
with
the
magic
penetration
needed
for
her
clears
and
ganking.
The
large
AP
granted
by
Spirit
of
the
Spectral
Wraith
it
is
often
the
best
jungling
item
for
karma,
granting
much
needed
stats
and
high
AP
to
continue
to
deal
reasonable
damage.
If
survivability
is
needed,
Spirit
of
the
Ancient
Golem
is
the
best
jungling
item
for
Karma
.

Deny
her
from

on

Karma's
is
a
difficult
champion
to
finish
if
pushed
to
a
corner.
Don't
turret
dive
her
or
overcommit
unless
you
can
finish
her
with
one
or
at
the
best
2
moves.
Soulflare
erupts
for
bonus
damage
in
the
area
in
which
it's
been
placed.
React
quickly
and
escape
the
circle
to
avoid
taking
heavy
damage.
This
ability
is
usually
combined
with
Focused
Resolve
to
prevent
an
escape,
so
play
accordingly.
Focused
Resolve
is
a
strong
disengage
tool.
Create
distance
to
avoid
being
rooted
and
seek
to
engage
afterwards.
Champions
you
depend
heavily
on
staying
on
melee
range
are
not
recommended
against
Karma's
as
she
can
use
Focused
Resolve
to
cut
short
any
engage
and
heavily
punish
it
with
Soulflare
or
Renewal
Focused
Resolve
has
a
very
sharp
mana
cost
compared
to
her
other
abilities.
Try
baiting
it
if
you
are
champion
with
dashes
or
blinks.
This
tactic
will
drain
her
mana
and
leave
her
without
her
main
CC
tool
Carefully
watch
for
the
dragons
on
her
back,
if
they
are
rotating
Mantra
is
off
cooldown.
Karma's
is
painfully
hard
to
kill
by
another
lone
champion.
She
will
play
around
her
Focused
Resolve
and
escape
with
Inspire
,
on
the
other
hand
she
can
be
quickly
killed
by
an
ambush
with
several
champions.
Karma's
arms
and
eyes
will
be
shining
brightly
whenever
she
activates
Mantra
.
Her
next
ability
within
8
seconds
will
be
enhanced.
Karma's
is
especially
dangerous
at
level
3,
since
she
has
her
whole
kit
available
at
this
point.
She
can
actually
get
her
full
damaging
combo
by
level
2,
be
very
conservative
until
you
hit
a
higher
level,
keep
your
distance
to
prevent
Focused
Resolve
and
keep
minions
between
you
and
her
to
prevent
the
massive
early
nuke
from
Soulflare
if
she
combos
it.
