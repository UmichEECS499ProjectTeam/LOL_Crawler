Kalamanda
in
Chaos
Swain
arrives
with
a
Demacian
prisoner
Quinton
Groat
reporting
from
Kalamanda
Swain
accuses
Demacia
of
framing
Noxus
with
the
confession
of
a
Demacian
prisoner.
The
situation
in
Kalamanda
sits
on
the
brink
of
catastrophe
as
Demacian
and
Noxian
forces
maintain
an
uneasy
standoff
in
the
wake
of
Kalamanda’s
alliance
with
Demacia.
Kalamanda’s
modest
population
spent
the
day
preparing
for
the
arrival
of
Jarvan
III,
King
of
Demacia,
who
is
accompanied
by
his
son
and
an
entire
phalanx
of
Demacian
Valor
Knights.
The
king
sent
word
late
last
night
that
he
would
visit
the
village
personally
to
sign
the
long-anticipated
agreement
granting
Demacia
exclusive
mining
rights
in
Kalamanda.
In
exchange,
Kalamanda
would
receive
trade
privileges,
a
portion
of
the
mined
resources,
and
protection
from
one
of
Valoran
’s
most
esteemed
militaries.
The
triumphant
atmosphere
became
subdued,
however,
when
Jericho
Swain
,
Master
Tactician
and
newly-appointed
General
of
Noxus,
appeared
with
his
own
military
entourage.
Tensions
peaked
as
Noxian
forces
marched
boldly
past
the
city
hall,
where
the
Demacians
were
meeting
with
city
officials
just
hours
before
the
signing.
Under
strict
orders
from
their
commanders,
both
factions
avoided
an
engagement,
though
tempers
flared
and
an
incursion
seemed
imminent.
The
Noxian
force
took
residence
in
the
former
Noxian
mining
camp
that
Noxus
was
asked
to
strike
when
Kalamanda
awarded
rights
to
Demacia.
With
Jarvan
III’s
assurance,
Kalamanda
officials
decided
to
proceed
with
the
signing
–
but
before
he
could
endorse
the
document,
Swain
emerged
from
the
crowd
with
a
bound
Demacian
soldier
in
tow.
The
soldier
seemed
weak
and
defeated
despite
showing
no
obvious
signs
of
injury.
Jarvan
IV,
the
Crown
Prince,
interrupted
the
proceedings,
shouting:
“What
do
you
think
you’re
doing,
Noxian?”
Swain
replied:
“This
man
has
confessed
to
the
murder
of
the
Noxian
citizen
in
the
mines,
and
the
attempted
framing
of
Noxus.”
The
Demacian
soldier
did
not
face
the
Royal
Party
until
commanded
by
King
Jarvan
himself.
A
brief
inquiry
revealed
that
the
soldier’s
name
was
Thom
Garvin,
and
when
the
King
asked
whose
orders
he
was
following,
he
sputtered:
“I
obeyed
the
commands
of
your
son,
the
Prince.”
At
that
point,
the
ceremony
dissolved
into
chaos.
Mayor
Anson
Ridley
requested
that
the
signing
be
postponed
until
a
proper
investigation
could
be
conducted.
King
Jarvan
III
demanded
that
Garvin
be
released
into
Demacian
custody,
but
Swain
argued
that
Garvin
was
a
key
witness
and
could
not
be
entrusted
to
either
government.
He
suggested
instead
that
Garvin
be
held
by
local
authorities,
and
only
interrogated
with
representatives
of
both
city-states
present.
Ridley
agreed
to
the
proposition
and
Jarvan
III
followed
suit.
Before
the
prisoner
departed,
Jarvan
IV
rattled
off
a
list
of
accusations
at
Swain,
denying
any
involvement
in
a
conspiracy.
Troops
on
both
sides
were
called
to
the
sides
of
their
leaders,
but
King
Jarvan
III
managed
to
de-escalate
the
situation
by
silencing
his
son
and
forbidding
his
troops
to
engage.
He
stated
to
Swain
that
he
would
leave
peaceably,
and
requested
that
Swain
honor
the
dictates
established
by
the
League
,
forbidding
open
combat.
Swain
consented,
and
withdrew
his
forces.
For
the
time
being,
both
parties
have
refrained
from
violence,
but
the
residents
of
Kalamanda
are
on
edge.
Some
have
even
chosen
to
abandon
the
village.
League
Adjudicators
were
dispatched
from
the
Institute
to
help
mediate
the
situation,
but
right
now
everyone
is
left
wondering:
what
will
happen
next?
Honoring
Our
Fallen
Champion
Celebration
in
Piltover
honors
the
passing
of
Urf
the
Manatee
Aria
Breker
reporting
from
Piltover
Despite
the
tension
and
strife
gripping
Valoran
in
recent
times,
people
from
across
the
continent
gathered
yesterday
in
Piltover
peacefully
to
honor
Urf
.
The
brave
manatee
was
remembered
with
a
day
of
festivities
that
included
cooking
contests,
races
in
the
Guardian’s
Sea,
werewolf-shaped
piñatas,
and
much
more.
Next
week
marks
the
one
year
anniversary
of
the
death
of
the
most
celebrated
marine
mammal
in
Runeterra
’s
history.
On
April
1st,
20
CLE,
the
excitement
leading
up
to
Urf’s
entrance
into
the
League
met
a
somber
end
in
a
horrifying
turn
of
events.
Urf
the
Manatee
was
slain
in
an
unfortunate
accident
on
Summoner's
Rift
during
his
very
first
match
as
a
League
champion
.
He
was
never
to
be
seen
again,
despite
spooked
summoners
’
claims
of
Urf
appearing
during
the
time
of
the
Harrowing
.
Kicking
off
the
day’s
celebrations
in
Piltover
was
League
Champion
Jax
.
“I
hardly
knew
him,”
he
declared
at
the
opening
ceremonies
with
a
tinge
of
sadness.
“But
I
have
nothing
but
admiration.
He
was
the
only
warrior
in
all
of
Valoran
other
than
myself
who
limited
his
extreme
power
according
to
League
sanctions.
Forever
lost
is
the
opportunity
to
learn
the
legendary
fish
and
spatula
technique
thanks
to
a
cruel
and
senseless
murder.”
Although
long-standing
rivalries
were
temporarily
put
aside
to
honor
the
fallen
manatee,
it
seems
that
the
day
was
not
immune
to
heated
opinions.
Piltovian
citizens
were
unable
to
hold
in
their
disgust
with
the
appearance
of
Professor
Stanwick
Pididly.
The
prevailing
scholar
of
Zaun
scoffed
at
the
celebration,
loudly
proclaiming
to
anyone
within
earshot
that
it
was
not
too
late
to
restore
Urf
back
to
life.
He
expressed
an
inability
to
understand
the
reason
behind
all
the
wasted
emotion
and
fanfare,
when
the
date
of
Urf’s
passing
was
still
recent
enough
for
the
Rite
of
Reclamation
to
be
effective.
Necromancy
is
heavily
frowned
upon
in
the
City
of
Progress,
and
as
such
Professor
Pididly
was
calmly
escorted
away
from
the
festivities
despite
his
protests
that
time
was
running
out
to
revive
Urf.
League
Champion
Warwick
,
the
suspected
perpetrator
of
Urf’s
demise,
was
notably
absent
from
the
celebration.
Trolling
with
a
Monk
Observations
shared
by
the
celebrity
of
the
Shojin
Monastery
L.B.
Briskes
commenting
from
The
Institute
of
War
The
hustle
and
bustle
of
editorial
journalism
taxes
a
spirit
even
as
sunny
and
exuberant
as
my
own.
I
find
that
if
the
sum
of
my
working
days
reaches
or
exceeds
the
number
spent
moping,
carousing,
or
brainstorming
illnesses
to
excuse
me
from
future
toil,
I
become
“more
crabby
than
Conqueror
Beach
in
turtle
season,”
as
my
new
secretary,
Olivia,
phrased
it.
I
advised
that
she
seek
to
sharpen
her
dress
(she
has
an
unfortunate
penchant
for
cardigans)
before
or
perhaps
alongside
her
metaphorical
wit,
but
she
merely
regarded
me
with
those
condemning
emerald
eyes
and
offered
to
facilitate
my
relocation
to
a
more
permanent
roost
beneath
the
beach’s
purportedly
crustacean-y
sands.
Within
moments
of
me
requesting
that
she
apply
a
coat
of
sunscreen
as
a
proper
sendoff,
Olivia
produced
an
itinerary
for
a
week-long
retreat,
promising
something
about
a
melted
Freljord
and
frozen
Shurima
before
she
would
append
lathering
to
her
job
description.
Nearly
four
weeks
since
my
last
hiatus,
this
retreat
was
scheduled
with
hopes
of
moderating
my
“bristly”
persona.
A
mind
as
fertile
and
vibrant
as
mine
requires
quite
the
reboot
after
a
bout
of
honest
labor,
so
she
booked
me
passage
to
the
enlightened
southern
shores
of
Ionia
.
Olivia
expressed
a
desire
that
I
seek
audience
with
(and
counsel
from)
the
most
patient
man
on
Runeterra,
the
now-blind
monk
of
the
Shojin
Monastery.
My
holiday
was
quite
refreshing
if
you
block
out
(as
my
flasks
of
gin
did)
the
portions
in
transit,
cramped
amongst
snot-flinging
infants
and
their
elephantine
mothers.
I
arrived
at
the
Shojin
monastery
in
good
spirits,
with
good
spirits,
to
find
the
celebrated
monk
whiling
away
his
sightless
hours
aboard
a
raft,
fishing
in
the
Monastery’s
bountiful
and
serene
Lake
Contemplation.
He
drifted
aimlessly
across
the
surface,
floating
in
whichever
direction
the
current
carried
him,
pole
swaying
in
gentle
rhythm,
catching
cold
faster
than
fish
by
the
looks
of
it.
Eventually
he
bobbed
to
shore
and
I
clambered
on.
It
was
there
that
he
shared
some
insights
of
trolling,
and
imparted
some
wisdom
gained
through
diligent
reflection.
“Many
fishermen
try
to
lure
the
fish.
I
seek
to
coax
the
water.”
He
mused
suddenly,
after
nearly
two
hours
of
silence
and
me
waving
my
hands
in
front
of
his
face,
trying
to
provoke
a
reaction.
With
confounding
ease,
he
dipped
one
hand
into
the
water
and
casually
extracted
a
wiggling
trout.
“With
perfect
technique,
I
may
catch
every
fish,
but
with
harmonious
water,
every
catch
will
be
a
trophy.”
He
tossed
the
writhing
trout
back
to
the
waves,
apparently
turning
a
blind
eye
to
my
growing
appetite.
Didn’t
see
that
coming.
You
will
endure
my
puns
whether
you
appreciate
them
or
not.
“Our
world
rewards
the
busy
man.
The
man
who
graduates
first
is
smartest.
The
man
who
conquers
furthest
is
strongest.
The
man
who
owns
most
is
richest.
But
as
man
fills
his
life
with
these
things,
he
loses
touch
with
his
only
true
possession:
his
self.
There
is
no
difference
to
spending
a
life
gazing
at
the
sky,
foregoing
the
earth
around
you
than
to
spend
a
life
accumulating
wealth,
power,
or
status,
foregoing
the
world
inside
you.
The
outside
alone
will
never
fill
the
inside.”
I
am
certain
at
this
point
that
he
was
openly
mocking
my
hunger.
“Valoran
is
a
place
where
one
man’s
misstep
can
ripple
outward,
causing
many
to
stumble.”
To
illustrate
his
point,
he
dropped
a
small
pebble
in
the
water.
“But
the
secret,
the
true
magic
of
this
place,
is
that
we
are
all
connected,
and
together
we
can
stand
again.”
At
this
he
stood,
and
drew
his
pole
up
out
of
the
water.
I
immediately
regretted
that
I
couldn’t
somehow
affect
a
sound
or
smell
faithful
to
my
sourly
flat-faced
expression
as
a
monstrous
trout
emerged
from
the
depths
at
the
end
of
his
line.
He
smiled
for
the
first
time
since
my
arrival.
“Alright,
put
away
your
moody
face,
it’s
time
to
eat.”

Senior
Summoner
Ralston
Farnsley
commenting
from
the
Institute
of
War
The
recent
turn
of
events
in
Kalamanda
is
distressing,
to
say
the
least.
If
Swain
is
telling
the
truth,
then
Demacia,
the
great
city-state
which
prides
itself
on
ethics
and
honor
has
stooped
quite
low
in
the
name
of
profit.
If
Swain
is
lying,
then
Noxus
is
taking
a
bold
and
dangerous
stand
against
Demacia
in
a
time
of
peace.
In
either
event,
I
hope
a
resolution
can
be
found
without
resorting
to
violence
and
therein
undoing
what
the
League
has
worked
so
hard
to
accomplish.
“What
is
the
story
of
Doran
and
his
trinkets
that
the
League
so
frequently
uses?
Who
was
Doran?
When
did
he
live?
Why
did
he
create
these
items?
I've
always
been
curious
as
to
the
origins
of
these
items
I
use
so
frequently
in
my
matches.”
–
Summoner
Afrasabi
of
Noxus
The
story
of
Doran
tugs
at
the
heartstrings.
They
say
Effrem
E.
Doran
was
born
with
a
hammer
in
his
hands
and
a
forge
in
his
heart.
Every
object
he
touched,
he
found
ways
to
improve,
and
he
knew
that
he
was
destined
to
be
a
brilliant
artificer.
At
the
age
of
15,
he
was
invited
to
the
League
with
an
offer
to
assume
the
role
of
Master
Artificer,
a
dream
come
true
and
an
unprecedented
honor
for
one
so
young.
However,
fate
had
other
plans.
En
route,
his
carriage
broke
an
axle.
When
he
leaned
down
to
inspect
it,
he
was
kicked
in
the
head
by
his
yonkey,
a
stern
blow.
He
stumbled
back
onto
the
wagon,
but
when
he
arrived
at
the
Institute
of
War
he
was
a
different
boy.
The
kick
had
rendered
his
mind
soft,
but
it
hadn’t
robbed
him
of
his
passion.
He
still
wanted
nothing
other
than
to
craft,
but
where
once
he
may
have
created
singular
masterpieces,
he
now
crafted…somewhat
simpler
items,
and
many
of
them.
He
is
a
kind,
goofy,
good-hearted
soul,
and
he
takes
pride
in
the
work
he
does.
His
items
are
daily
selected
by
champions
on
the
Fields
of
Justice,
and
he
has
a
permanent
home
at
the
Institute.
“I've
developed
one
question
for
Blitzcrank
.
Were
it
to
happen
again,
what
would
your
reaction
be
to
the
creation
of
more
autonomous
golems
like
yourself?
You
could
serve
as
the
gateway
of
creation
for
more
and
more
creatures
not
too
dissimilar
from
yourself.
Would
it
be
a
magnificent
thought?
Or
would
it
be
something
a
bit
more
confounding?”
–
Corroded
Zeplin
His
compatibility
services
in
full
swing,
Blitzcrank
seemed
particularly
energized
when
I
approached
him
with
your
question.
“THE
PROCESS
WHICH
LED
TO
MY
AUTOMATION
IS
NOT
CONFOUNDING,
IT
CURRENTLY
LACKS
NECESSARY
DATA.
PROBABILITY
INDICATES
THAT
THIS
DATA
WILL
BE
RECALCULATED
AND
THE
PROCESS
WILL
EVENTUALLY
BE
REPRODUCED.
MY
ATTENTION
IS
MORE
FOCUSED
ON
THE
QUESTION
OF
WHETHER
I
CAN
SPLIT
MY
SPARK
TO
FORM
NEW
INTELLIGENCES,
OR
‘BLITZLINGS’.”
“My
query
is
to
the
selectors
of
the
worlds.
Where
can
I
summon
my
champions
from?
Just
wondering
if
there
might
be
a
way
to
affect
the
decisions
made
about
future
worlds
that
become
available
to
draw
upon
and
the
type
of
people
we
can
‘use’?”
–
Cloudstrife1987
The
recent
arrival
of
Renekton
has
opened
the
door
for
many
questions
like
this,
but
I
would
like
to
remind
everyone
that
the
League
has
strictly
prohibited
summoning
from
other
worlds.
When
the
art
of
summoning
was
young,
those
mages
powerful
enough
to
practice
it
summoned
beings
from
distant
places
without
their
consent,
often
to
serve
against
their
will.
Since
that
time
we
have
grown,
and
most
forms
of
magic
as
potent
as
summoning
are
illegal
outside
of
the
controlled
environment
of
the
League
of
Legends.
This
is
essential
to
preserving
Runeterra.
Beyond
that,
summoning
creatures
or
people
from
other
planets
or
against
their
will
is
expressly
forbidden,
except
in
some
very
special
circumstances
approved
by
the
League.
