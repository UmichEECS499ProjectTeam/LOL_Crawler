Udyr,
the
Spirit
Walker
is
a
champion
in
League
of
Legends
.
[1]
Abilities
Udyr
uses
the
stance
mechanic.
His
abilities
all
have
a
persistent
effect
which
remain
until
he
activates
another
ability.
Each
ability
also
has
a
temporary
activation
effect
that
occurs
upon
being
cast;
the
temporary
effect
of
each
stance
persists
for
its
full
duration
even
if
Udyr
changes
stance
again.
Switching
stances
sets
off
a
2
second
global
cooldown.
All
of
Udyr's
abilities
have
5
ranks,
but
as
Udyr
can
only
gain
a
maximum
of
18
skill
points
at
level
18,
he
cannot
ever
max
out
all
of
his
abilities.
He
may
max
three
abilities
(with
the
fourth
only
reaching
its
3rd
rank)
or
he
may
max
two
abilities
(with
the
other
two
reaching
their
4th
rank).
Monkey's
Agility
Each
time
Udyr
switches
stances,
he
gains
5
flat
movement
speed
and
10%
attack
speed
for
5
seconds.
This
effect
can
stack
up
to
3
times.
Ability
Details
Monkey's
Agility
is
a
self-buff
.
Additional
Information:
Further
stance
activations
at
maximum
stacks
of
Monkey's
Agility
will
refresh
the
timer.

seconds
to

Ability
Details
Tiger
Stance
is
a
self-buff
ability
with
an
on-hit
effect
component.
Applies
spell
effects
as
a
damage
over
time
ability.
Spell
vamp
is
fully
applied.
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
will
apply
a
15%
slow.
The
triggering
attacks
will
apply
other
on-hit
effects
and
can
critically
strike
as
normal.
Like
most
on-hit
physical
damage,
the
bonus
damage
from
Tiger
Stance
will
apply
life
steal
.
Critical
strikes
do
not
interact
with
the
bonus
damage
from
Tiger
Stance.
The
persistent
onhit
physical
damage
can
successfully
be
dodged
,
parried
and
blocked
.
PENDING
FOR
TEST
However,
they
do
not
prevent
application
of
the
active
DoT.
If
Udyr
is
blinded
,
neither
the
persistent
damage
nor
the
active
damage
will
be
applied,
and
it
will
consume
the
empowered
attack
of
the
active.
Spell
shields
will
not
block
the
enhanced
autoattack.
Additional
Information:
Despite
being
an
on-hit
effect,
Tiger
Stance's
active
DoT
will
trigger
spell
effects
as
a
damage-over-time
spell,
such
as
spell
vamp
and
the
reduced
version
of
Rylai's
slow.
Tiger
Stance's
DoT
does
not
stack;
applying
it
again
only
refreshes
the
duration.
Tiger
Stance's
primed
DoT
does
not
persist
through
stance
changes.

I
do
not
like
Pulsfire
Ezreal
that
much
actaully.
I
am
a
fan
of
Explorer
Ezreal.
So
for
me,
Spirit
Guard
Udyr
is
the
better
skin.
