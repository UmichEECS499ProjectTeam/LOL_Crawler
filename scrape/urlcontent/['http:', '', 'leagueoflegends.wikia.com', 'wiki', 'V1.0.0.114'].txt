Hotfix

considered

the
majority
of
the
community.

hotfix
contains
the

damage
scaling

changes
for
the

in

.
Undocumented
changes
Champions
Pantheon
Walking
animation
has
been
updated.
Grand
Skyfall
:

a
bug
where
AoE

wasn't
showing
for
some
users.

Spirit
Fire
particle
has
been

Patch
preview
For
this
patch,
we’re
mainly
focusing
on
bug
fixes,
as
well
as
some
more
buffs
to
several
champions
.
The
reason
we
went
for
this
focus
was
to
prepare
for
the
upcoming
patch,
in
which
we’re
preparing
some
interesting
solutions
to
damage-vs-defense,
counters
to
tank-stacked
teams,
and
other
larger
balance
changes.
We
added
an
extra
maximum
Yordle
Snap
Trap
to
Caitlyn
,
which
will
improve
her
team
utility
presence,
along
with
an
attack
speed
boost
to
give
her
a
little
more
ability
to
scale
into
late-game
damage.
Garen
’s
movement
speed
was
increased
to
320,
and
gave
a
massive
early
game
increase
to
the
damage
reduction
on
Courage
.
This
ability
needs
to
be
more
reliable
in
the
laning
phase
to
allow
Garen
to
close
and
be
effective.
Doubling
the
rank
1
value
should
be
a
big
help
in
this
regard.
Galio
’s
ultimate
has
had
it
range
increased
by
50,
to
give
it
some
additional
value
in
more
spread
out
fights.
We
plan
to
continue
adjusting
Galio.
Finally,
we’ve
changed
towers
to
protect
better
against
unattended
minion
waves,
but
less
against
coordinated
pushes.
We
wanted
to
avoid
lengthening
game
times,
but
at
the
same
time
want
to
make
it
so
leaving
minion
waves
unattended
isn’t
quite
so
punishing.
This
change
aims
to
accomplish
that.
