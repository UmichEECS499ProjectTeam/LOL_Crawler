Notes
The
transformation
of
Manamune
into
Muramana
isn't
unique.
You
can
have
more
than
one,
but
toggle's
buff
can
be
only
applied
once(second
click
on
any
of
your
Muramana
will
just
cancel
it)
If
you
own
both
Archangel's
Staff
and
Manamune
before
reaching
750
bonus
mana,
Archangel's
Staff
takes
priority
and
will
transform
into
Seraph's
Embrace
.
The
transformation
drains
Mana
Charge,
leaving
the
remaining
Manamune
on
0
bonus
mana.
This
can
be
recharged,
and
will
transform
into
Muramana
upon
completion.
It
is
possible
to
charge
a
third
Tear
of
the
Goddess
for
a
further
750
bonus
mana.
Note
that
the
Awe
and
Insight
passives
of
Archangel's
and
Manamune,
and
the
transformation
passives
are
unique
and
so
further
purchases
won't
provide
anything
beyond
the
base
stats.
Muramana
toggle
ability
is
treated
similar
to
on-hit
effects.
This
item,
by
itself,
grants
a
total
of
40
attack
damage
with
its
passive.
Also,
by
itself,
the
first
hit
of
its
active
will
consume
30
mana
to
grant
60
bonus
physical
damage
on
attacks
and
single-target
spells.
There
is
sometimes
a
tooltip
bug
where
the
bonus
AD
from
mana
will
"cap"
at
80,
however,
the
actual
bonus
AD
from
mana
not
capped
and
will
still
be
granted.
While
unstated
in
the
in-game
description,
the
item
does
not
trigger
on
single
target
damage
over
time
abilities,
such
as
Torment
,
or
non-damaging
abilities
such
as
Cocoon
.
In-game
description:
"Single
target
abilities
or
attacks
will
consume
3%
of
your
current
mana
to
deal
twice
that
as
physical
damage."
Multiple
component
spells
which
are
calculated
as
single-target
spells,
such
as
Syndra's
Unleashed
Power
,
will
proc
Muramana's
passive
multiple
times,
in
this
instance
this
will
result
in
additional
physical
damage
up
to
roughly
38.4%
of
the
champion's
current
mana.
Manaless
champions
may
charge
the
Tear
of
the
Goddess
,
Manamune
and
Archangel's
Staff
to
get
Muramana
and
Seraph's
Embrace
.
However,
they
will
not
get
any
bonuses
from
Muramana's
Awe
and
toggle,
as
well
as
Seraph's
Embrace's
Insight
and
Mana
Shield
.
Runaan's
Hurricane
applies
Muramana's
bonus
damage
on
each
bolt,
draining
mana
dramatically
while
dealing
bonus
damage.
Single-target
item
actives
like
Blade
of
the
Ruined
King's
apply
Muramana's
toggle.
There
are
a
selection
of
on-hit
effects
that
are
classified
as
abilities,
and
will
trigger
Muramana's
damage
twice.
The
reason
for
this
is
Muramana
is
triggered
once
as
an
on-hit
effect,
and
once
as
an
on-ability
effect.
Typically,
an
ability
will
apply
either
on-hit
effects
or
on-ability
effects,
but
the
following
abilities
apply
both:
Jax's
Empower
,
Jax's
Grandmaster's
Might
,
Leona's
Shield
of
Daybreak
and
Twisted
Fate's
Stacked
Deck
.
Poppy's
Devastating
Blow
and
Twisted
Fate's
Pick
A
Card
apply
both
on-hit
effects
and
on-ability
effects,
like
the
above.
However,
the
basic-attack
component
deals
0
damage.
Unlike
how
Muramana
will
not
trigger
if
an
ability
deals
no
damage
(such
as
Cocoon
),
it
will
trigger
if
an
attack
deals
no
damage.
Prior
to
v3.03,
Kassadin's
Nether
Blade
would
trigger
the
damage
on
each
attack
while
active.
Leona's
Sunlight
and
Lux's
Illumination
will
also
trigger
Muramana
when
the
marks
are
consumed,
potentially
allowing
for
double-damage
if
they
are
triggered
by
a
basic
attack
or
single
target,
non-periodic
spell.
With
the
exception
of
Fizz's
Urchin
Strike
,
abilities
that
apply
on-hit
effects
will
only
trigger
Muramana
once.
Urchin
Strike
is
an
exception
because
it
applies
both
on-hit
effect
and
on-abilities
effects,
while
all
other
examples
only
apply
on-hit
effects.
Muramana's
on-hit
passive
does
not
proc
life
steal
or
spell
vamp.
Trivia
The
name
Muramana
seems
to
be
based
off
of
Muramasa
,
a
sword
made
by
a
famous
Japanese
swordsmith.
Muramana
is
the
first
item
to
have
a
toggle.
The
ability
toggle
could
be
a
reconstruction
of
the
old
passive
of
Wit's
End
.
