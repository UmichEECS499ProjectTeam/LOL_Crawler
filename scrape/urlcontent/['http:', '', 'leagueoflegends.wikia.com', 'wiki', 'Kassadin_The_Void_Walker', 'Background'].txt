There
is
a
place
between
dimensions
and
between
worlds.
To
some
it
is
known
as
the
Outside,
to
others
it
is
the
Unknown.
To
most,
however,
it
is
called
the
Void
.
Despite
its
name,
the
Void
is
not
an
empty
place,
but
rather
the
home
of
unspeakable
things,
horrors
not
meant
for
minds
of
men.
Though
such
knowledge
is
lost
in
modern
times,
there
are
those
who
have
unwittingly
discovered
what
lies
beyond,
and
they
have
been
unable
to
turn
away.
Kassadin
is
such
a
creature.
He
was
once
a
man
forced
to
look
upon
the
face
of
the
Void
and
forever
changed
by
what
he
saw.
Once
a
seeker
of
forbidden
knowledge,
he
discovered
that
what
he
sought
was
something
else
entirely.
He
is
one
of
the
few
that
has
found
his
way
to
forgotten
Icathia
and
lived
to
tell
the
tale,
following
the
scant
breadcrumbs
hidden
in
ancient
texts.
Within
a
decaying
cyclopean
city,
Kassadin
found
secrets
of
the
kind
that
he
will
never
share
-
secrets
that
made
him
quake
with
fear
at
the
visions
of
things
to
come
that
were
thrust
upon
him.
The
power
of
the
place
threatened
to
consume
him
forever,
but
Kassadin
took
the
only
route
available
to
him
in
order
to
survive
-
he
let
the
Void
inside
him.
Miraculously,
he
was
able
to
overcome
the
alien
urges
that
went
with
it,
and
he
emerged
as
something
more
than
human.
Though
a
part
of
him
died
that
day,
he
knows
that
he
must
protect
Valoran
from
the
things
scratching
at
the
door,
waiting
to
get
in
and
visit
their
torments
upon
the
world.
They
are
only
one
step
away...
something
to
which
the
appearance
of
the
abomination
known
as
Cho'Gath
attests.
"If
you
look
upon
the
Void,
you
can't
put
it
behind
you.
If
you
look
upon
Kassadin,
he
is
probably
already
there."
There
is
a
place
between
dimensions,
between
worlds.

some
it
is

the
Outside,
to

it
is
