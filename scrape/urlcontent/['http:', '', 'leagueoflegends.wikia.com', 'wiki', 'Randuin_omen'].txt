Strategy
Randuin's
Omen
is
a
strong
counter
to
Blade
of
the
Ruined
King
,
as
it
provides
armor,
health,
an
attack
speed
slow
and
a
movement
speed
slow;
and
the
two
actives
mostly
mitigate
each
other.
It
is
also
useful
against
champions
that
are
highly
reliant
on
auto-attacking
as
means
of
damage
output
(
Jax
,
Kog'Maw
,
Teemo
,
Tristana
,
Udyr
,
and
Vayne
).
Warden's
Mail
,
Frozen
Heart
,
and
Randuin's
Omen
are
the
only
items
that
can
reduce
attack
speed
.
Randuin's
Omen
is
commonly
purchased
by
tanky
melee
DPS
champions,
especially
the
manaless
champions
like
Dr.
Mundo
,
Garen
,
Lee
Sin
,
and
Riven
that
don't
benefit
from
Frozen
Heart
because
of
the
mana
it
gives.
Using
the
active
on
Randuin's
Omen
while
your
champion
is
channeling
an
ability
will
end
the
channel
prematurely.
Notes
Randuin's
Omen
is
named
after
former
Riot
employee
Robin
'Randuin'
Liao.
Randuin's
Omen's
active
effect's
debuff
is
named
Black
Omen,
possibly
a
reference
to
the
floating
palace
bearing
the
same
name
from
the
game
Chrono
Trigger
.
