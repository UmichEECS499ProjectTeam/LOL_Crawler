Trivia
Singed
was
designed
by
both
Ezreal
and
Guinsoo
.
According
to
Udyr
,
Singed
was
the
first
ever
champion
to
be
created
in
the
game.
[1]
Singed
is
possibly
a
reference
to
the
werewolf
chemist
in
the
first
Underworld
movie.
Singed's
lore
shares
some
similarities
with
the
chemist
Fritz
Haber
.
There
are
also
similarities
in
the
ethical
implications
of
both
their
work.
Singed
was
one
of
the
champions
chosen
for
the
Noxian
pool
available
during
the
Ionia
vs.
Noxus
match
.
He
was
one
of
the
selected
champions.
Singed's
dance
is
the
"Jump
on
It"
dance
from
The
Fresh
Prince
of
Bel-Air
.
Kayle's
dance
is
similar,
but
includes
the
beginning
of
the
dance,
where
she
throws
her
hands
up
and
to
both
sides.
A
side-by-side
comparison
of
Singed's
dance
can
be
seen
here
.
Even
though
Singed's
Poison
Trail
cloud
appear
to
expand
as
they
fade,
the
area
affected
by
the
poison
does
not
actually
increase.
A
popular
YouTube
channel
known
as
'
videogamedunkey
'
has
made
a
running
gag
in
several
of
his
videos
(
1
2
)
where
Singed
is
depicted
as
a
repeat
offender
for
oddities
and
"trolling",
as
well
as
being
responsible
for
conspiracies
involving
in
the
League
of
Legends.
In
one
of
his
more
recent
videos,
he
claimed
that
Singed
is
in
a
fact
the
"Owner
and
Operator"
of
Riot
Games
;
albiet
going
through
elaborate
detail
on
what
led
to
this
conclusion.
A
bottle
of
Singed's
poison
can
be
seen
leaking
in
the
Mac
Launch
preview
video.
Singed's
bald
figure,
red
and
green
color
motifs,
and
his
large
boots
make
him
resemble
Sigma
from
the
Mega
Man/Rockman
X
series.
Quotes
Singed's
line,
"To
shake,
or
not
to
shake,"
is
a
play
on,
"To
be,
or
not
to
be,"
a
famous
quote
from
William
Shakespeare's
play
Hamlet
.
Singed's
joke,
"Shaken,
not
stirred."
is
a
reference
to
a
famous
quote
of
James
Bond
,
a
fictional
British
secret
agent.
Singed's
bio
quote,
"My
deadliest
dose
shall
bear
my
patron's
name!"
is
a
reference
to
a
line
from
The
Devil's
Dictionary
by
Ambrose
Bierce:
"My
deadliest
drug
shall
bear
my
patron's
name!"
,
referring
to
Mercury.
Singed's
line,
"Mix,
mix,
swirl,
mix."
is
a
reference
to
a
scene
from
the
the
Star
Wars
Holiday
Special
.
Skins
Riot
Squad
Singed
was
normally
only
available
via
promotional
codes.
It
was
first
gifted
at
the
Gamescom
2010
and
other
events
that
Riot
Games
attends
to,
such
as
PAX
and
E3
.
However,
the
skin
has
now
been
replaced
with
the
K-9
Nasus
skin.
During
some
events,
Riot
Games
enabled
the
skin
at
the
in
game
store,
allowing
anyone
to
purchase
it
using
RP,
[2]
the
last
instance
of
this
being
2011's
PAX
Prime
.
Taric
is
on
the
bottle
of
Surfer
Singed
splash
art,
complete
with
surfer
shades.
The
bottle
is
labeled
"Taric's
Tropical
Tan".
Surfer
Singed
is
one
of
two
champion
skins
which
use
a
surfboard
as
a
shield,
the
other
being
Pool
Party
Leona.
Mad
Scientist
Singed
is
based
on
the
stereotypical
mad
scientist
.
The
skin
also
bears
a
resemblance
to
Dr.
Mundo's
original
skin
before
the
game
was
released.
Augmented
Singed
is
possibly
a
reference
to
Bane
from
the
Batman
franchise.
The
skin's
release
date
is
also
very
close
to
the
premiere
of
the
new
Batman
movie,
The
Dark
Knight
Rises
,
in
which
Bane
is
the
main
villain.
Relations
Singed
was
Warwick's
apprentice
in
alchemy,
until
his
master
was
transformed
by
Soraka's
spell
during
the
Noxian
invasion
of
Ionia.
The
two
were
good
friends
too.
Singed
invented
the
toxic
weapon
used
on
Master
Yi's
home
village.
The
remains
of
the
village
were
so
horrific
that
it
remains
a
festering
scar
on
Ionian
history.
To
this
day,
no
Ionian
will
ever
publicly
speak
of
what
occurred.
During
an
Ionian
ambush
on
Noxian
troops,
Singed
launched
a
barrage
of
biochemical
terror
on
both
forces.
Riven
witnessed
as
around
her
Ionian
and
Noxian
alike
fell
victim
to
an
unspeakably
gruesome
fate.
Singed
and
Blitzcrank
are
on
unfriendly
terms
with
one
another.
[3]
Singed
is
commonly
teammates
with
his
fellow
Zaunites
,
Warwick
and
Dr.
Mundo
,
on
the
Twisted
Treeline
.
[4]
In
the
Navori
Province
of
Southern
Ionia,
Singed
was
charged
with
the
extermination
of
an
unexpected
giant
rat
infestation.
Some
suspect
that
Twitch
may
have
been
involved
in
the
rodent
invasion.
[5]
Singed
is
a
business
partner
of
Gragas
,
responsible
for
supplying
him
with
brewing
machinery
and
hardware.
