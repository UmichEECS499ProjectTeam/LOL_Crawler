At
this
speed,
a
fully
stacked
Sword
of
the
Occult
grants

speed.
The

Mejai's
Soulstealer
,
Sword
of
the
Occult
,
and
the
removed
Leviathan
were
a
trio
of
"
Snowball
Sister
Items"
that
shared
a
stack
feature
based
on
champion
kills/assists.
This
item
resembles
a
Kukri
,
a
Nepalese
knife.
At
20
stacks
Sword
of
the
Occult
provides
more
attack
damage
than
any
item
except
Manamune
and
Muramana
(if
the
wearer
has
4500
mana
or
more)
and
also
the
Atma's
Impaler
(if
the
wearer
has
7400
health
or
more).
A
fully
stacked
Sword
of
the
Occult
provides
the
highest
amount
of
raw
attack
damage
of
any
item
in
the
game,
surpassing
a
fully
stacked
The
Bloodthirster
by
10
attack
damage.
This
does
not
mean,
however,
that
it
grants
the
highest
potential
damage,
especially
on
carries
who
also
rely
on
critical
chance,
attack
speed
and
lifesteal.
The
stacking
buff
granted
by
Sword
of
the
Occult
when
a
kill
or
assist
is
scored
is
called
"Blood
Tribute."
