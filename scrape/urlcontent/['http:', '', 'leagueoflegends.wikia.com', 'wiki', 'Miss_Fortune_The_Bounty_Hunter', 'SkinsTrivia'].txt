Trivia
Miss
Fortune
was
designed
by
Geeves
.
Sarah
Fortune
is
her
real
name,
Miss
Fortune
is
made
to
sound
like
misfortune.
This
relates
to
the
old
sailor
myth
that
women
on
ships
were
bad
luck.
Her
Ultimate's
name,
Bullet
Time
,
is
based
off
of
a
term
used
in
movies
in
which
all
action
goes
into
slow-motion,
a
term
coined
by
the
Max
Payne
video
game
franchise.
Her
matched
pistols
('Shock'
and
'Awe')
are
a
reference
to
a
military
tactic
which
dictates
the
use
of
overwhelming
firepower
and
battlefield
awareness
to
drain
the
enemy's
will
to
fight
back.
Miss
Fortune
was
one
of
the
champions
available
to
be
chosen
for
the
Noxian
pool
during
the
2nd
Ionia
vs.
Noxus
match
.
She
was
one
of
the
selected
champions.
Miss
Fortune
could
be
a
reference
to
Rue
Meridian
from
"The
Voyage
of
the
Jerle
Shannara"
books
by
Terry
Brooks.
Rue
Meridian
is
an
airship
crew
member/mercenary
that
"is
capable
of
charming
any
man".
They
are
also
visually
similar.
Gangplank
may
be
visually
based
off
her
brother,
a
captain
of
the
ship.
Her
twin
pistols
can
be
seen
in
the
Mac
Version
Launch
preview
video
for
League
of
Legends.
Miss
Fortune
appearance
in
her
classic
looks
is
somewhat
similar
to
Elza
from
Final
Fantasy
XII:
Revenant
Wings.
Elza,
like
Miss
Fortune,
is
also
a
pirate(sky
pirate
actually),
wears
rather
revealing
attire
and
equips
guns
which
the
barrel
have
larger
circumference
at
the
muzzle.
Quotes
Miss
Fortune's
selection
quote:
"Fortune
doesn't
favor
fools!"
is
likely
a
spin-off
of
the
latin
saying:
"Fortuna
favet
fortis",
which
translates
to
"Fortune
favors
the
brave."
Some
of
her
quotes
are
direct
references
to
Han
Solo
from
Star
Wars
A
New
Hope
.
"I
always
shoot
first"
:
Refers
to
Han's
shoot-out
with
Greedo
.
"Don't
get
cocky"
:
A
famous
Han
Solo
quote.
"I've
got
a
good
feeling
about
this"
:
Han
uses
a
similar
phrase
.
"Watch
your
mouth
kid,
or
you'll
find
yourself
respawning
at
home!"
:
An
adapted
version
of
one
of
Han's
lines.
The
French
Taunt
is
a
reference
to
the
movie
"The
Good,
the
bad
and
the
Ugly".
Skins
The
pose
she
is
in
for
her
old
Classic
skin
artwork
resembles
the
Captain
Morgan
pose.
A
poster
of
her
in
her
classic
skin
has
"Work
Hard"
written
at
the
bottom
in
the
Mac
Launch
preview.
Waterloo
Miss
Fortune
skin
is
a
reference
to
depictions
of
Napoleon
Bonaparte
at
the
time
of
the
"
Battle
of
Waterloo
".
Waterloo
Miss
Fortune
and
Minuteman
Gangplank
skins
both
reference
historic
times
of
war.
Mafia
Miss
Fortune,
Gangster
Twitch
,
Mafia
Graves
and
Mafia
Jinx
share
a
Mafia
theme.
Secret
Agent
Miss
Fortune
gives
Miss
Fortune
a
modern
espionage
Femme
fatale
theme.
Secret
Agent
Miss
Fortune
resembles
the
character
of
Jessica
Rabbit
of
the
movie
"Who
Framed
Roger
Rabbit?".
Secret
Agent
Miss
Fortune
skin
closely
resembles
Ada
Wong
of
Resident
Evil
Series
and
Anna
Williams
of
Tekken
Series.
The
background
in
the
second
Chinese
Secret
Agent
Miss
Fortune
splash
art
alludes
to
the
night
street
scenes
found
in
Hong
Kong
Island
and
Kowloon
.
One
of
the
neon
bulletins
in
the
background,
多兰武器坊,
translates
to
"
Doran
weapon
workshop".
The
bulletin
in
the
top-right
corner
has
an
image
of
Janna
.
The
pose
is
the
same
she
has
in
her
Tempest
Janna
Chinese
splash
art.
In
the
Chinese
Art
for
her
Cowgirl
Miss
Fortune
skin,
you
can
see
a
poster
to
the
left,
declaring
Bandito
Fiddlesticks
wanted.
The
name
of
the
Road
Warrior
Miss
Fortune
skin
may
have
been
inspired
by
the
movie
Mad
Max
2:
The
Road
Warrior.
Her
Road
Warrior
Miss
Fortune
skin
closely
resembles
the
post-apocalyptic
clothing
worn
by
people
in
the
same
movie.
The
sawed-off
double
barrel
shotgun
design
for
the
skin
might
have
been
inpired
by
Max
Rockatansky's
sawed-off
double
barrel
shotgun
from
the
same
movie.
Relations
Miss
Fortune
is
searching
for
the
person
who
killed
her
mother,
a
man
with
red
eyes.
Miss
Fortune
has
a
strong
distrust
for
pirates
and
she
finds
herself
constantly
bickering
with
the
infamous
Gangplank
(the
only
captain
to
resist
her
charms)
over
the
direction
of
Bilgewater
politics.
Miss
Fortune
defeated
Gangplank
in
the
Bilgewater
GrugMug
Grog
Slog
competition.
