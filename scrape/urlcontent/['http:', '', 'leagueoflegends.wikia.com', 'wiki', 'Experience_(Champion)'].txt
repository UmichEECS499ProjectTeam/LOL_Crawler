Champion
experience
is
the
way
the
champions
level
up
periodically.
This
allows
them
access
to
new
abilities
or
higher
ranks
of
existing
abilities.
Also
many
base
stats
and
runes
scale
as
your
champion
levels
up.
Gaining
experience
There
are
various
methods
to
get
experience:
Champion
kills
:
Killing
an
enemy
champion
rewards
a
player
with
an
amount
of
experience
determined
by
the
level
of
the
champion
slain.
The
experience
gained
is
equal
to
75%
of
the
total
experience
required
for
a
champion
to
go
from
the
slain
champion's
current
level
to
the
next
level
up.
In
other
words,
if
a
level
7
champion
is
slain,
the
total
experience
gained
is
75%
of
the
total
experience
required
for
a
champion
to
go
from
level
7
to
level
8,
or
705
(=
0.75
×
940)
experience
points.
The
experience
reward
will
be
increased
if
there
is
a
positive
level
difference
between
champions
(e.g.
a
level
5
champion
killing
a
level
7
champion)
and
decreased
if
the
level
difference
is
negative.
[1]
Assists
:
A
champion
is
given
an
assist
after
damaging
an
enemy
champion
that
is
then
killed
within
10
seconds.
A
champion
granted
an
assist
will
evenly
split
the
total
experience
reward
for
killing
the
enemy
champion
with
all
other
players
that
received
an
assist
or
landed
the
killing
blow
or
are
within
1600
range
of
the
killing
blow.
Minions
:
Killing
minions
in
League
of
Legends
grants
an
amount
of
experience
upon
their
death.
The
experienced
gained
by
the
champion
is
determined
by
the
type
of
minion.
Experience
from
minion
deaths
is
split
between
all
champions
within
1600
range.
Turrets
:
Whenever
an
enemy
inner,
inhibitor
or
turret
is
destroyed,
all
champions
of
the
team
are
granted
experience
depending
on
the
turret.
No
experience
is
granted
for
outer
turrets.
Neutral
monsters
:
Each
type
of
neutral
monster
in
League
of
Legends
gives
a
different
amount
of
experience
upon
death.
Experience
points
from
neutral
monsters
are
split
between
every
allied
champion
within
an
400-unit
range.
Jungle
monsters
grant
50%
bonus
XP
per
level
to
lower-level
champions,
up
to
a
cap.
Teemo's
mushrooms
also
grant
experience
if
destroyed.
