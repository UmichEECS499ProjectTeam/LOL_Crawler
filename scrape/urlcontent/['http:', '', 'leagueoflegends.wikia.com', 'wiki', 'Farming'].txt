Farming
is
the
act
of
a
champion
killing
multiple
minions
to
gain
gold
.
Certain
champions
have
abilities
which
aid
them
in
farming.
Farming
early
game
will
allow
you
to
purchase
better
items,
making
your
late
game
stronger.
Later
in
the
game,
farming
opportunities
will
be
fewer.
Farming
is
an
essential
component
of
early-game
laning.
Champions
try
to
out-farm
the
enemy
and
"win"
the
lane.

How
to
Farm
The
aim
is
to
achieve
more
"CS",
which
stands
for
"Creep
Score",
which
represents
how
many
minions/monsters
you
have
killed.
You
only
receive
gold
and
CS
for
"last-hitting"
the
minion/monster.
This
means
that
you
should
always
try
to
get
the
killing
blow
on
minions.
Game
Phases
Early
Game
This
is
the
main
phase
for
farming.
Many
champions
have
abilities
which
aid
farming,
either
by
making
it
easier
to
land
the
killing
hit
(eg.
Annie's
Disintegrate
),
or
by
granting
extra
gold
,
such
as
Gangplank's
Parrrley
,
Twisted
Fate's
Loaded
Dice
or
Ashe's
Hawkshot
.
It
is
harder
to
get
CS
when
your
lane
is
pushed
to
your
tower,
since
the
turret's
attacks
are
stronger
than
your
own,
causing
it
to
kill
many
minions.
On
the
other
hand,
you
can
push
the
lane
to
the
opponent's
tower,
where
they
will
lose
CS.
However,
this
is
risky,
as
it
opens
the
lane
up
to
ganks.
Mid
Game
When
teamfights
begin,
gold
will
come
from
killing
champions,
lane
minions,
and
clearing
the
jungle
monster
camps.
When
possible,
lanes
can
still
be
farmed,
though
your
absence
can
hurt
your
team
in
a
teamfight.
Late
Game
Now
the
game
will
mainly
focus
on
teamfights,
meaning
that
farming
is
secondary.
Despite
this,
minion
waves
will
slowly
accumulate
(usually
in
side
lanes
where
teamfights
are
not
taking
place).
These
can
provide
large
gold/experience
boosts,
though
as
stated
before,
your
absence
can
potentially
hurt
your
team.
Farming
Table
Many
players
underestimate
the
value
of
farming
creep
kills.
The
following
table
displays
how
much
gold
can
be
earned
when
you
kill
all
minions
in
your
lane.
This
table
is
theoretical.
The
table
below
ignores
travel
time
of
minions
in
order
to
prevent
a
bias
of
lane
positioning
and
can
be
seen
as
an
absolute
maximum
for
creep
score.
To
use
it
in
reality,
estimate
the
Creep
Score
you
will
have
and
you
can
calculate
the
gold
you
have
without
kills.
You
can
do
this
for
certain
points
in
the
game
(e.g.
first
time
back,
beginning
of
mid
game)
and
optimize
your
item
build.
This
table
was
produced
and
posted
originally
on
the
league
of
legends
forums
by
bluebaron201.
Another
alternative
is
to
use
the
Creep
Score
Calculator
,
which
allows
for
more
interactivity.
This
tool
was
produced
and
posted
to
Reddit
by
TheMullinator.
The
table
calculates
the
spawned
minons,
but
it
does
ignores
the
travel
time
to
the
lane.
On
bot
lane
at
10
minutes
the
maximun
number
of
minions
killed
will
be
101
(48
melee
minions,
48
ranged
minions
and
5
siege
minions)
there
will
be
a
creep
wave
passing
it's
teams
tower
in
the
10
minute
mark,
I
did
not
count
those.
