Project
Shiny
is
a
project
that
was
built
to
overhaul
LoL’s
graphics,
improving
them
texture-and-model-wise
to
look
better
on
faster
rigs.
League
of
Legends'
lead
producer
Travis
George
claimed
that
Project
Shiny
and
Dominion
were
originally
a
combined
development.
The
hope
was
that
these
combined
projects
would
synergize
with
each
other
and
turn
out
to
be
better
than
expected.
However,
due
to
Dominion's
development
phase,
it
had
many
iterations
and
many
unknown
variables.
As
Project
Shiny
team
was
working
mainly
on
Summoner's
Rift
,
their
request
of
finalized
data
on
Dominion
cannot
be
fulfilled,
which
in
turn,
created
a
tension
between
the
two
teams.
This
had
further
caused
a
stall
in
Project
Shiny,
even
after
Dominion
was
finished.
George
took
it
that
the
mismatch
and
goal
discrepancies
between
the
two
teams
cannot
continue,
and
therefore
separated
Dominion
and
Project
Shiny
into
two
detached
entities.
