Evelynn's
origins
are
shrouded
in
mystery
-
a
mystery
she
herself
helps
to
perpetuate.
What
everyone
does
know
about
Evelynn,
however,
is
that
she
is
one
of
the
most
skilled
assassins
in
Valoran
.
It
is
clear
upon
first
meeting
her
that
she
is
not
quite
human.
Some
theorize
that
she
was
cursed
with
a
mild
form
of
fantastical
vampirism
as
a
child.
Supporters
of
this
theory
contend
that
her
ability
to
sap
the
very
life
essence
of
her
opponents
on
(and
off)
the
Fields
of
Justice
,
while
still
being
able
to
tolerate
direct
sunlight,
would
account
for
this
belief.
There
is
some
evidence
that
Evelynn
originally
came
from
the
Shadow
Isles
-
the
mysterious
island
located
northwest
of
Valoran
that
is
eternally
blanketed
by
a
thick,
unnatural
fog.
It
is
thought
that
the
Shadow
Isles
are
home
to
countless
forms
of
undead,
though
no
one
seems
eager
to
perform
the
exploration
necessary
to
find
out
the
truth.
Evelynn
neither
confirms
nor
denies
her
connection
to
Shadow
Isles.
The
power
brokers
of
Valoran
know
that
Evelynn's
services
come
at
the
highest
of
premiums,
and
her
recent
addition
to
the
League
of
Legends
indicates
that
her
ambitions
are
growing.
Her
savagery
on
the
Fields
of
Justice
has
been
so
great
that
new
rumors
about
her
origins
are
now
circulating.
The
most
popular
one
-
an
abuse
of
magic
as
a
child
morphed
her
into
the
hungering
beast
her
opponents
see
on
the
battlefield
-
always
makes
her
smile
when
hearing
it...
an
act
which
bares
her
razor-sharp
fangs
and
teeth.
Evelynn
now
curries
favor
from
League
summoners
,
gaining
influence
for
reasons
known
only
to
her.
While
the
nature
of
her
plans-
much
like
almost
everything
else
about
her
-
remains
unknown,
there's
little
doubt
that
those
plans
are
now
set
on
the
world
stage.
"There
is
little
mystery
about
her
to
me
-
she
is
the
ultimate
predator."

Ability
Remake
Announcement
made
by
Statikk
:
[1]
In
an
upcoming
patch
we'll
be
revisiting
two
of
the
first
champions
to
grace
the
Fields
of
Justice:
Twitch,
the
Plague
Rat,
and
Evelynn,
the
Widowmaker.
These
champions
haven't
been
as
viable
as
we'd
like
them
to
be
due
to
problematic
long-term
stealth
mechanics.
For
Evelynn,
her
core
ability
Shadow
Walk
allowed
her
to
remain
invisible
for
long
periods
of
time,
ultimately
forcing
players
to
stay
on
the
defensive
and
favor
cautious
play.
Since
we
want
the
action
to
remain
a
fun
and
fluid
experience
throughout
the
match,
we
decided
to
update
these
champions
with
some
new
stealth
abilities.
Because
Evelynn
has
always
been
the
consummate
assassin
in
League
of
Legends,
we
really
wanted
to
preserve
that
bloodthirsty
feeling
of
stalking
an
enemy
champion.
Instead
of
traditional
invisibility,
however,
we
decided
to
retool
Shadow
Walk
into
a
new
form
of
persistent
stealth.
Whenever
Evelynn
is
out
of
combat,
this
passive
version
of
Shadow
Walk
will
kick
in
after
a
short
period
of
time,
reducing
the
range
at
which
enemy
champions
can
see
her.
Additionally,
while
in
this
state
Evelynn
will
be
invisible
to
all
Sight
Wards,
minions
and
Vision
Wards
will
still
be
able
to
spot
her
as
normal.
This
new
version
of
Shadow
Walk
will
allow
Evelynn
to
close
in
on
an
enemy,
positioning
herself
closer
to
melee
range
while
she
waits
for
the
opportune
moment
to
attack.
To
help
her
initiate
in
an
appropriately
predator
manner,
her
new
Dark
Frenzy
ability
can
give
her
the
movement
speed
boost
she
needs
to
quickly
close
the
distance
on
an
unsuspecting
target.
Additionally,
we've
modified
Ravage
so
that
it
not
only
functions
as
a
nuke
but
also
as
an
attack
speed
bonus
to
help
her
quickly
take
down
her
victim.
Should
she
score
a
kill
or
assist,
the
cooldown
on
Dark
Frenzy
is
reset,
allowing
her
to
either
redouble
the
attack
or
escape
and
vanish
as
quickly
as
she
came.
Evelynn
also
faced
challenges
participating
in
team
fights.
To
give
her
some
additional
staying
power
when
entering
the
fray,
Evelynn
can
employ
her
new
ultimate
ability
Agony's
Embrace.
This
new
ultimate
targets
an
area,
dealing
damage
and
slowing
the
enemies
it
hits.
In
addition
to
its
offensive
effects,
Agony's
Embrace
also
grants
Evelynn
a
significant
damage
shield
for
each
enemy
champion
caught
within
the
target
area.
Combined
with
the
strategic
advantage
of
Shadow
Walk,
this
shield
can
give
the
Widowmaker
the
tactical
advantage
she
needs
to
quickly
reach
and
tear
down
a
high
value
target
in
a
team
fight.
For
even
more
added
punch
in
these
group
situations,
we've
also
increased
the
range
on
Hate
Spike
and
updated
it
to
strike
multiple
targets
in
a
line
each
time
it's
cast.
This
added
team
fight
utility
combines
with
Evelynn's
new
persistent
stealth
to
keep
her
alive
and
dangerous
even
in
the
more
advanced
stages
of
the
game
when
group
action
is
more
prevalent.

massive
attack
speed
boost
for
a
short
duration
thereafter.
Agony's
Embrace:
Evelynn
impales
all
enemies
in
a
target
area,
dealing
magic
damage
based
on
their
maximum
health
and
slowing
them.
She
then
gains
a
shield
based
on
how
many
enemy
champions
she
hit.
