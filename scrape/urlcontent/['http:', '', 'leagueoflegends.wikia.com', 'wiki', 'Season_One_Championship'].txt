Announcement
Announced
by
RiotMarcou
[1]
Summoners,
You’ve
patiently
waited
for
this
day
since
we
first
announced
Season
One
during
the
summer
of
2010.
Throughout
the
course
of
Season
One
our
community
has
grown
tremendously,
and
there
have
been
many
new
additions
to
the
game:
draft
mode,
ranked
games,
ladders,
Co-op
vs.
AI,
and
18
new
champions
released
to
date.
We’ve
also
seen
our
competitive
scene
explode
with
the
selection
of
League
of
Legends
in
hallowed
eSports
tournaments
such
the
World
Cyber
Games,
the
Electronic
Sports
League
Major
Series,
and
the
Intel
Extreme
Master
Season
5
Finals.
In
addition
to
these
selections,
we’ve
launched
the
Season
One
Circuit
which
have
certified
nearly
50
professional
tournaments,
supported
dozens
of
community
run
tournaments,
witnessed
weekly
cups
featuring
over
2000
competitors,
and
watched
weekend
tournament
streams
that
have
supported
nearly
150,000
unique
viewers.
It’s
time
to
put
Season
One
to
rest…
but
not
before
we
determine
the
best
League
of
Legends
team
in
the
world
and
award
over
$100,000
in
cash
prizes!
To
do
this,
we’ll
conclude
the
Season
One
Circuit
on
Monday,
May
2nd
and
shortly
afterwards
determine
the
top
teams
from
each
region.
After
that
we’ll
fly
the
top
eight
teams
from
around
the
globe
to
Dreamhack
Summer
in
Jönköping,
Sweden,
where
they
will
compete
over
the
course
of
3
days
–
from
June
18th
to
June
20th
–
until
only
one
team
remains.
The
Season
One
Championship
will
mark
the
official
end
to
Season
One
and
will
be
followed
by
an
off
season.

For
our
summoners
that
haven’t
heard
of
Dreamhack,
it
is
the
world’s
largest
digital
festival
and
holds
the
official
record
as
the
world’s
largest
LAN
party
in
the
Guinness
Book
of
Records.
DreamHack
Summer
is
a
four-day,
24/7,
all-ages
event
for
gamers,
but
with
activities
for
everyone.
DreamHack
is
also
a
recognized
eSports
destination,
with
an
extensive
schedule
of
tournaments
for
gamers
of
all
skill
levels
–
from
casual
to
professional
–
and
noteworthy
cash
prizes
for
winners.
We
also
want
to
make
sure
that
we
bring
every
moment
of
the
tournament
directly
to
our
players
and
fans.
We’re
going
to
make
sure
that
the
live
stream
viewing
experience
is
amazing
for
every
exhilarating
match.
Over
140,000
viewers
streamed
the
Intel
Extreme
Masters
exhibition
matches,
and
we
can’t
wait
to
see
how
many
people
tune
in
for
the
Championship!
So
spread
the
word!
Qualifiers
Season
1
will
conclude
with
a
$100,000
Grand
Finals
featuring
the
best
teams
from
all
over
the
world.
Teams
will
qualify
for
the
grand
finals
by
competing
in
a
circuit
of
local,
online,
and
global
events.
At
the
end
of
each
event,
top
placing
teams
will
not
only
be
rewarded
with
cash
and
prizes,
but
will
also
earn
ranking
points
that
establish
them
as
the
best
in
their
region.
Many
summoners
will
thrive,
but
only
one
team
will
earn
the
title
of
Season
1
Champion.
The
Grand
Finals
are
scheduled
from
June
18
to

The
Grand
Final
After
many
battles
the
two
teams
that
were
still
standing
were
Fnatic
and
Against
All
Authority.
Managing
to
not
fall
once
in
the
upper
bracket,
Fnatic
appeared
very
strong.
And
appearing
for
a
rematch,
Against
All
Authority
came
back
to
face
Fnatic
again
after
losing
to
them
in
the
Upper
Bracket
Final
Match
by
defeating
TSM
2-0
in
the
lower
bracket
final.
Yet,
as
both
teams
proved
very
strong
in
the
tournament,
Fnatic
emerged
victorious
with
a
2-1
score
and
became
the
Season
One
Champions.
