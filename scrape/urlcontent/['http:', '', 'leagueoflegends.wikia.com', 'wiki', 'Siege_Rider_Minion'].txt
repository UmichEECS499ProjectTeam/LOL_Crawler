The
subject
of
this
article
was
removed
from
League
of
Legends
.
The
information
displayed
is
no
longer
relevant
to
League
of
Legends,
but
exists
here
for
historical
purposes.
A
Siege
Rider
Minion
was
an
advanced
minion
that
resulted
from
casting
the
non-dominion
version
of
the
summoner
spell
Promote
on
any
nearby
minion.
It
was
removed
from
gameplay
along
with
Promote
due
to
balancing
issues
where
several
players
in
a
team
would
simultaneously
Promote
regular
minions
into
those
Siege
Rider
Minions
in
a
single
lane
,
granting
them
enormous
pushing
power
in
that
lane.
These
minions
are
confirmed
to
be
removed,
as
Promote
and
Banner
of
Command
now
turn
super
minions
into
Anti-turret
cannons
in
Dominion
and
Summoner's
Rift
respectively.
