Champion
Background

Skins
&
Trivia
Skill
Usage
During
early
laning,
it
is
best
for
Varus
to
spec
into
either
one
of
Piercing
Arrow
or
Blighted
Quiver
for
his
preferred
harassment.
Blighted
Quiver
makes
last-hitting
much
easier
and
lets
him
outdamage
most
carries
early
on
during
autoattack
exchanges,
whereas
Piercing
Arrow
lets
him
snipe
minions
that
would
be
hard
to
reach
and
is
a
superior
harass
from
range.
You
should
spec
into
Blighted
Quiver
if
you
can
reliably
get
away
with
going
into
autoattack
range
and
Piercing
Arrow
when
you
will
likely
be
strongly
zoned.
Using
Flash
while
channeling
Piercing
Arrow
will
not
interrupt
the
spell.
You
can
use
this
to
finish
off
escaping
enemies.
During
skirmishes,
it's
sometimes
best
to
fire
Piercing
Arrow
quickly,
rather
than
charging
it
to
full
power
-
although
the
ability
gains
range
and
damage
with
charge
time,
he
cannot
autoattack
as
he
does
so
and
Varus
will
likely
be
sacrificing
a
greater
DPS
if
he
takes
too
long.
Piercing
Arrow
has
a
distinct
sound
effect
and
causes
Varus
to
change
stance
and
slow
down
while
charging
it,
making
it
easy
to
see
coming.
Try
casting
the
ability
from
brush
to
keep
the
element
of
surprise.
Piercing
Arrow
gains
more
power
and
range
the
longer
it
is
charged.
However,
the
ability
does
not
need
to
be
channeled
for
the
full
duration
in
order
to
reach
its
maximum
potential.
The
range
indicator
for
the
ability
will
visibly
expand
once
the
ability
begins
to
be
channeled.
Once
the
indicator
stops
growing,
you
will
no
longer
gain
any
benefit
for
additional
channel
time.
Try
to
take
advantage
of
Piercing
Arrow's
very
long
range
to
snipe
at
enemy
champions
before
a
fight
or
as
they're
trying
to
flee.
Varus
can
also
very
reliably
steal
buff
camps
with
the
ability.
Most
importantly,
he
can
snipe
the
Dragon
from
behind
its
cove
wall
with
it
even
if
it
has
been
pulled
out
to
the
river
by
the
opposing
team.
When
aiming
for
Varus'
greatest
possible
DPS,
you
should
employ
strict
cadence
and
fire
off
an
ability
after
each
three
autoattacks
on
an
opponent
in
order
to
detonate
the
most
Blight
stacks.
Remember
that
Blighted
Quiver
stacks
on
the
enemy
will
only
detonate
when
Varus
connects
with
one
of
his
other
abilities,
and
all
of
his
abilities
have
moderately
long
cooldowns
-
if
you
use
Piercing
Arrow
and
Hail
of
Arrows
to
initiate
a
fight,
you
will
be
left
without
an
ability
to
proc
Blight
stacks
for
a
short
while.
Blight
stacks
will
last
for
several
seconds
before
expiring
-
if
you
have
the
chance,
you
can
increase
the
efficiency
of
your
large-scale
attacking
even
more
by
hitting
multiple
targets
sequentially
and
getting
stacks
on
as
many
opponents
as
possible
before
detonating
them
all
at
once.
Since
both
skills
scale
with
AD
and
are
multi-target,
Varus
can
effectively
farm
large
waves
of
minions
instantly
late
game
using
only
Piercing
Arrow
and
Hail
of
Arrows
.
He
can
be
an
effective
pusher
lategame
if
needs
be.
Hail
of
Arrows
is
useful
for
helping
you
escape
from
or
catch
up
to
opponents
due
to
the
slow.
It
should
also
be
noted
that
the
healing
debuff
is
very
strong
against
champions
that
have
heals
such
as
Soraka
.
Applying
stack
of
Blight
in
a
short
period
of
time
(~0,5
seconds)
after
landing
Hail
of
Arrows
and
detonating
other
stacks
will
still
detonate
the
stack
applied
after
Hail
of
Arrows'
landing,
making
it
possible
to
detonate
total
of
4
stacks
on
single
target
with
Hail
of
Arrows
alone.
Chain
of
Corruption
has
many
uses
-
it
can
assist
greatly
in
a
gank
by
preventing
the
opposing
team
from
fleeing,
can
cause
massive
disruption
in
a
teamfight
if
it
is
allowed
to
spread,
and
can
help
ensure
your
own
escape
when
on
the
run.
Remember
that
the
disable
from
the
ability
is
a
snare
,
not
a
stun
-
ranged
attackers
and
mages
can
still
attack
and
use
most
abilities
while
they
are
caught.
It
can
be
much
more
effective
to
target
any
melee
attackers
instead,
as
they
will
be
far
more
badly
affected
by
the
inability
to
move.
Build
Usage
Due
to
Varus'
late
game
farming
potential
with
Piercing
Arrow
and
Hail
of
Arrows
,
he
can
very
quickly
charge
up
Bloodthirster
stacks,
making
the
item
an
even
better
fit
than
usual
for
him.
Varus
benefits
more
than
most
carries
from
Phantom
Dancer
:
aside
from
the
attack
speed
and
critical
strike
which
greatly
increase
his
overall
DPS,
the
large
movement
speed
bonus
it
gives
him
helps
to
cover
his
lack
of
a
solid
escape
ability.
Building
a
Last
Whisper
can
be
a
very
useful
item
on
Varus
increasing
the
damage
output
on
his
Piercing
Arrow
Hail
of
Arrows
as
well
as
standard
auto-attacks.
The
Black
Cleaver
is
also
a
very
good
item
as
it
decreases
enemies
armor,
grants
cooldown
reduction
and
health.
Last
Whisper
is
a
better
choice
against
high
armor
targets
though.
Recurve
Bow
based
items
can
increase
Varus's
DPS
and
give
him
some
other
stats
to
help
him
out:
Wit's
End's
passive
additional
magic
damage
can
stack
with
Blighted
Quiver
and
gives
him
some
additional
protection
against
sustained
magic
DPS.
Runaan's
Hurricane
gives
a
high
amount
of
attack
speed
and
applies
Blight
stacks
on
up
to
3
enemies
at
once.
Trinity
Force
can
be
an
unusual
build
choice
for
Varus
-
while
it's
high
price
will
interfere
with
other
carry
item
purchases,
he
benefits
well
from
all
of
its
stats
and
passive
effects.
In
particular,
Sheen
procs
can
be
consumed
immediately
after
a
Blighted
Quiver
detonation,
giving
Varus
impressive
burst
potential.
Despite
Varus'
primary
role
as
an
AD
carry,
an
AP/AS
hybrid
can
be
a
deceptively
effective
build
in
the
correct
circumstances.
This
style
of
play
involves
usage
of
the
AP
ratios
on
his
Blighted
Quiver
to
deliver
respectable
autoattack
damage
and
has
formidable
burst
potential
from
Blight
detonations
and
Chain
of
Corruption
.
Nashor's
Tooth
is
one
of
AP
Varus
core
items
-
it
grants
him
ability
power
and
attack
speed
to
make
use
of
his
Blighted
Quiver
,
and
cooldown
reduction
is
crucial
on
him
to
proc
detonations
of
Blight
as
often
as
possible.
The
on-hit
magic
damage
passive
of
the
Malady
has
been
added
to
Nashor's
Tooth
,
further
increasing
Varus's
damage
output
with
auto-attacks
with
this
item.
A
Lich
Bane
can
add
considerable
damage
to
his
burst
immediately
following
a
detonation.
Applying
all
3
stacks
of
Blight
and
detonating
them
with
Chain
of
Corruption
results
in
massive
burst
damage
If
Varus
requires
some
additional
multi-target
damage
output,
he
can
choose
to
buy
a
Runaan's
Hurricane
after
some
early
ability
power
has
been
obtained
to
allow
him
to
debuff
several
enemies
with
Blight
at
once,
and
then
bursting
them
all
together
with
Chain
of
Corruption
.
Deathfire
Grasp's
active,
Doom,
has
good
synergy
with
and
the
%
health
damage
his
Blighted
Quiver
provides
him
due
to
its
damage
being
based
on
the
target's
maximum
health
and
amplifying
any
damage
the
target
takes
against
Varus
.
Against
a
low-MR
champion
that
has
3
stacks
of
Blight
,
using
Chain
of
Corruption
after
applying
Deathfire
Grasp's
active
can
result
in
a
spectacular
and
deadly
burst
of
damage.
This
is
likely
going
to
kill
outright
champions
who
have
build
purely
offensive
items,
mostly
Marksmen
and
Mages,
but
might
not
be
enought
to
blow
up
a
tankier
fighter.
To
deal
with
them
is
preferable
to
detonate
3
stacks
of
Blight
with
Hail
of
Arrows
,
apply
3
again
and
detonate
with
Chain
of
Corruption
.
The
snare
the
ability
offers
is
useful
to
escape
if
the
enemy
managed
to
take
on
the
full
combo
and
is
still
quite
healthy.
When
following
this
build
it
is
very
obvious
to
max
out
Blighted
Quiver
.
Your
other
2
basic
abilities,
Piercing
Arrow
and
Hail
of
Arrows
only
scale
with
attack
damage,
but
the
later
provides
more
reliable
(faster
animation
and
missile
speed)
Blighted
Quiver
detonations,
making
it
your
more
preferable
ability
to
max
second.
Piercing
Arrow
should
only
be
used
to
snipe
targets
afar
who
got
away
before
being
able
to
detonate,
others
who
escape
while
you
are
stacking
up
for
a
second
detonation
or
if
both
your
Chain
of
Corruption
and
Hail
of
Arrows
are
on
cooldown.
For
Piercing
Arrow
you
should
only
charge
up
the
ability
if
you
need
the
increased
range,
as
the
damage
scales
only
on
AD
so
it
is
insignificant
to
charge
up.
If
your
opponent
is
nearby,
immediatly
fire.
Building
a
Hextech
Gunblade
or
a
Guinsoo's
Rageblade
can
also
be
useful
in
an
AP/hybrid
build
due
to
the
build's
normally
distinct
lack
of
any
sustain
being
made
up
for
by
the
life
steal
and
spell
vamp
boosts
both
items
provide.
However
do
remember
that
Blight
procs
do
not
benefit
off
spellvamp
or
lifesteal.
Even
in
AP-based
build,
building
lategame
Blade
of
the
Ruined
King
after
core
items
can
be
a
good
idea,
given
that
it
provides
you
with
much
needed
sustain,
attack
speed
and
%health
damage.

Avoid
being
caught
by
Chain
of
Corruption
.
Fanning
out
from
a
caught
ally
in
teamfights
will
break
the
tether
and
minimize
the
disruption
it
causes
to
you.
When
Varus
begins
to
charge
Piercing
Arrow
,
he
will
slow
down
and
draw
his
bow
back.
He
cannot
perform
any
other
action
while
in
this
stance
and
his
movement
speed
is
reduced,
so
take
advantage
of
this
time
to
juke
the
shot
or
close
the
distance
on
him.
Varus
lacks
the
mobility
that
many
other
AD
carries
possess,
which
means
he
is
more
vulnerable
than
most
to
errant
crowd
controls
and
gank
attempts,
and
also
means
he
has
trouble
fleeing
from
diving
champions
in
teamfights.
A
single
snare
can
be
a
death
sentence
for
him.
Much
like
the
case
of
Jinx
who
also
lacks
movility
but
compensates
with
very
high
steroids
and
nukes
Varus
benefits
from
one
of
the
highest
burst
among
all
marksmen
and
extremely
long
range
damage.
As
his
burst
depends
on
skillshots
keeping
yourself
constantly
on
the
move
will
keep
you
safer.
Varus'
lack
of
mobility
mechanics
also
means
he
can
have
difficulty
avoiding
skillshots.
Being
a
skillshot-based
champion
himself,
he
also
has
difficulty
with
mobile
champions
like
Ezreal
,
Vayne
,
or
Graves
as
they
all
have
the
means
to
dodge
his
spells.
Once
Varus
has
used
Piercing
Arrow
and
Hail
of
Arrows
,
he
will
be
unable
to
detonate
Blighted
Quiver
stacks
for
several
seconds.
It
may
be
a
good
idea
to
engage
him
after
you
see
him
use
those
two
abilities.
Being
hit
by
Hail
of
Arrows
reduces
your
champion's
healing
and
regeneration,
so
save
any
healing
abilities
until
you
have
exited
the
desecrated
zone.
Although
Chain
of
Corruption
can
be
very
disruptive
to
many
champions,
neither
it
nor
any
of
Varus'
other
abilities
will
interrupt
channels.
Champions
with
powerful
channeled
abilities
such
as
Fiddlesticks
and
Nunu
can
freely
cast
their
abilities
without
fear
of
having
their
channels
discontinued.
Varus's
Hail
of
Arrows
only
deals
damage
once
on
impact.
When
fighting
Varus
1v1,
don't
be
afraid
of
standing
inside
the
Desecrated
Ground
unless
the
reduced
healing/movement
speed
will
significantly
hurt
your
capabilities.
Watch
out
for
Piercing
Arrow
when
Varus
fully
charges
it,
especially
if
you
have
several
stacks
of
Blighted
Quiver
,
as
you
will
receive
formidable
damage.
Varus
becomes
more
dangerous
after
he
has
scored
a
kill.
If
time
and
positioning
permits,
it
is
wise
to
let
his
passive
attack
speed
bonus
wear
off
before
reengaging
on
him.
During
the
laning
phase,
wait
for
his
bonus
attack
speed
from
killing
a
minion
to
wear
off
before
committing
to
a
skirmish
with
him.
Doing
so
while
his
bow
glows
red
can
be
a
dangerous
maneuver,
as
in
tandem
with
Blighted
Quiver
,
Varus
can
quickly
outtrade
most
other
autoattacking
champions.
In
teamfights,
it
is
easy
for
Varus
to
obtain
a
great
attack
speed
bonus
for
scoring
a
kill
or
assist,
signified
by
his
bow
glowing
a
light
silver-purple
.
As
a
teamfight
often
does
not
allow
a
team
to
quickly
disengage
to
let
this
bonus
wear
off,
it
strongly
encourages
good
positioning
and
teamwork
to
avoid
any
deaths
letting
Varus
snowball
his
advantage.
If
Varus
builds
ability
power,
which
is
pretty
rare,
he
suffers
under
an
extremly
weak
early
game
as
he
has
no
real
damaging
ability
besides
the
passive
of
his
Blighted
Quiver
.
As
the
game
proceeds,
however,
he
will
get
more
dangerous
and
can
deal
immense
amounts
of
damage,
especially
to
your
tanks.
Try
to
take
him
down
immediatly
after
a
teamfight
started
to
prevent
from
him
stacking
his
blight
and
detonating
it
with
Chain
of
Corruption
.
This
is
even
more
important
when
he
posesses
a
Runaan's
Hurricane
,
as
he
can
stack
blight
onto
your
whole
team
and
trigger
it
with
his
ultimate,
dealing
high
percentage
numbers
of
everyone's
maximum
health
as
magic
damage.
