An
Assist
is
the
action
of
helping
an
allied
champion
kill
someone.
You
can
either
score
an
assist
by
hitting
(without
killing)
the
champion
in
the
last
10
seconds
before
their
death,
or
by
contributing
passively
during
this
period
of
time.
When
a
champion
is
killed,
the
main
killer
gets
a
certain
amount
of
gold,
while
50%
of
that
amount
is
divided
up
among
everyone
who
got
an
assist
on
it.
But
if
a
player
has
2
more
assists
than
kills
they
earn
30
additional
gold
for
their
next
assist.
If
they
have
3
more,
it's
45,
and
4
more

kills
reaches
the
bonus
cap
of
60
extra
gold.
This
bonus
cannot
be
more
than
the
original
value
of
the
kill.
