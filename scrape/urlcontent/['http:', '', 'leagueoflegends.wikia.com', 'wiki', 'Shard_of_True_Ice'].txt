Notes
Upgrading
Frostfang
to
Frost
Queen's
Claim
does
not
improve
its
ability
to
generate
gold,
other
than
by
removing
the
passive
disable
when
killing
minions.
Unlike
Spellthief's
Edge
and
Frostfang
,
Frost
Queen's
Claim's
passive
cannot
not
be
disabled.
The
damage
type
of
the
bonus
damage
will
match
the
trigger.
Area
of
effect
abilities
will
use
one
charge
per
enemy
champion
hit.
On-hit
effects
will
not
trigger
Tribute
(although
the
triggering
attack
can).
Damage
over
time
abilities
will
trigger
Tribute
once
per
instance
of
damage.
Trivia
Face
of
the
Mountain
,
Frost
Queen's
Claim
,
and
Talisman
of
Ascension
are
a
trio
of
items
designed
for
supports
and
themed
after
locations
from
the
game's
lore.
Spellthief's
Edge
,
Frostfang
,
and
Frost
Queen's
Claim
are
all
tied
to
the
Freljord
.
