Redirected
from
Dreamhack
Season
One
Championship
Season
One
is
a
competitive
time
frame
that
League
of
Legends
began
hosting
on
July
13,
2010
in
patch
V1.0.0.96
.
[1]
It
marked
the
official
kickoff
of
competitive
League
of
Legends
and
there
are
some
events
and
partnerships
planned
for
it.
[2]
Pendragon
announced
that
the
start
of
Season
1
was
on
July
13,
2010.
[2]
Season
1
ended
on
August
23,
2011.
[3]
[4]
[5]
During
Season
One,
28
new
champions
were
released.

Champions
available
Champions
are
being
rotated
during
seasons,
including
"in-season"
champions,
this
means
while
you
can
play
all
the
champs
in
Normal
Games
,
there
will
be
some
Champions
that
won't
be
allowed
in
the
Ranked
Games
:
That's
a
very
insightful
question.
We
thought
a
lot
about
that,
and
in
the
short
term,
we're
going
to
keep
releasing
champions.
In
the
longer
term,
as
we
roll
out
competitive
seasons,
our
first
season
will
include
all
champions,
but
our
additional
seasons
will
feature
a
reduced
set
of
"in-season"
champions.
This
means
that
--
while
you
can
always
play
all
champions
in
[casual
play]
--
the
featured
competitive
mode
will
have
a
reduced
set
of
champions
that
rotates
periodically
as
we
cycle
through
seasons.
This
allows
us
to
revitalize
the
metagame;
if
a
particular
strategy
is
getting
really
strong,
one
way
to
make
things
interesting
is
to
just
change
the
champion
rotation.
And
it
also
reduces
the
learning
burden
for
someone
coming
in,
so
they
don't
have
to
learn
60
champions
--
they
only
have
to
learn
35
or
40,
or
whatever
number
we
determine.
[6]
Features
The
following
features
were
confirmed
on
the
June
15
preview
of
the
Season
1
and
have
been
implemented
since
the
beginning
[7]
:
Ranked
Games
-
In
Season
One,
summoners
of
Level
30
will
be
able
to
indulge
in
the
ranked
game
system.
At
launch,
ranked
players
will
be
able
to
join
one
of
three
queues:
3v3
Premade,
5v5
Premade,
or
5v5
Solo.
Players
will
receive
an
individual
rating
for
each
of
these
queues.
Ladders
-
Once
Ranked
Play
begins,
players
who
choose
to
participate
will
have
their
Elo
ratings
displayed
publicly
on
the
League
of
Legends
Ladder.
On
the
ladder,
players
will
be
able
to
see
just
how
they
stack
up
against
the
rest
of
their
fellow
summoners.
The
ladder
will
be
available
on
the
League
of
Legends
Community
Site.
Draft
Mode
-
Champion
selection
during
ranked
play
will
take
on
the
form
of
a
live
draft.
In
5v5
premade
and
3v3
premade,
the
first
phase
of
this
draft
process
will
provide
the
inviter
of
each
team
with
the
opportunity
to
ban
the
use
of
two
champions.
Banned
champions
cannot
be
selected
for
use
on
either
team.
After
bans
have
been
dispensed
by
both
sides,
the
teams
will
begin
the
draft
process.
During
ranked
play,
draft
picks
will
be
exclusive,
meaning
that
a
drafted
champion
will
not
be
available
for
play
by
the
opposing
team.
The
team
who
received
the
second
ban
will
begin
the
drafting
process
by
drafting
a
single
champion.
Following
that,
the
game
will
follow
a
1:2:2:2:2:1
draft
format
for
the
5v5
brackets
and
a
1:2:2:1
format
for
the
3v3
bracket.
Through
this
system,
players
are
encouraged
to
embrace
a
wider
range
of
champions,
allow
for
teams
to
effectively
counter
popular
strategies,
and
develop
a
familiarity
with
their
opponents
and
counter
accordingly.
Initially
Draft
Mode
will
be
available
both
in
Ranked
Play
and
in
practice
games.
Normal
games
still
utilize
blind
pick
during
champion
selection.
Improved
Visual
Styles
-
With
the
substantial
renovations
required
to
support
Ranked
Games,
Riot
decided
to
undergo
a
complete
facelift
of
the
PvP.net
interface.
The
new
look
for
League
of
Legends
is
"brighter,
more
visually
appealing,
and
easier
to
use"
.
