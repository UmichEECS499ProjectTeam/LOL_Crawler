The
Trees
Live!
And
they
agree,
it’s
overrated
L.B.
Briskes
commenting
from
the
Institute
of
War
Two
saplings
preparing
to
strike.
It’s
not
often
that
I
am
the
deliverer
of
breaking
news.
I
prefer
to
leave
the
“Johnny-on-the-scene”
shtick
to
the
younger
lot,
whose
wisdom
is
trumped
by
naïveté.
Mind
you,
I
don’t
mean
to
downplay
their
efforts.
After
all,
it
is
upon
their
broken,
labored
backs
that
my
salary
is
generated.
For
that,
the
martini
of
my
indifference
is
garnished
with
a
modest
olive
of
unspoken
appreciation.
(Those
of
you
who
would
assert
that
vermouth
would
have
made
for
a
stronger
metaphor
have
no
business
partaking
of
any
beverage
not
distilled
in
a
bathtub.)
Digression
aside,
it
so
happened
that
while
most
diligent
young
reporters
were
out
“pounding
the
streets”
or
“keeping
noses
to
grindstones”
(or
whatever
hackneyed
jargon
the
kids
are
peddling
these
days),
I
was
attending
a
match
on
the
Twisted
Treeline
.
I’d
nestled
myself
in
the
corner
of
the
VIP
area
amongst
a
throng
of
noisy
summoners
who
spent
the
better
part
of
the
pre-game
festivities
expounding
the
virtues
of
self-importance.
Fortunately,
they
were
preoccupied
enough
to
afford
me
some
privacy,
a
thing
as
rare
and
cherished
as
the
overpriced
hot
dog
I
purchased
from
the
Arena
stands.
The
match
began
as
one
would
expect,
with
champions
from
Piltover
and
Zaun
exchanging
tiresome
banter
and
moody
glares.
The
action
was
painfully
dull.
I'd
just
risen
to
make
an
early
exit
when
the
crowd
around
me
stood
in
unison
to
a
chorus
of
gasps
and
shrieks.
When
I
turned,
what
I
beheld
was
something
truly
odd.
A
tree
,
part
of
the
scenery,
had
suddenly
become
quite
mobile.
The
champions,
despite
often
being
privy
to
sights
which
would
cow
or
at
least
startle
the
average
man,
seemed
to
be
in
an
equal
state
of
shock.
The
collectively
dropped
jaw
of
all
onlookers
fell
lower
still
as
the
rampaging
arbor
slew
all
six
champions
on
the
map.
His
techniques
were
quite
unusual.
He
was
able
to
coax
life
into
saplings,
which
he
then
hurled
at
his
opponents,
and
which
themselves
attacked
once
they
landed.
All
the
while
--
as
though
walking
were
an
insignificant
evolution
--
the
tree
was
talking!
Unfortunately,
perhaps
too
quickly
adopting
the
common
demeanor,
he
was
whining
incessantly
about
the
recklessness
of
magic
and
the
tragedy
of
upsetting
nature.
I
admit
that
I
have
previously
allowed
myself
to
muse
on
the
topic
of
sentient
plants,
but
never
once
had
I
envisioned
them
so
eager
to
return
to
the
drudgery
of
stillness
and
the
eventual
promise
of
fueling
a
fire,
stabilizing
a
cart,
or
housing
rodents.
Although
the
plants
of
my
musings
also
didn't
single-handedly
dispatch
a
sextet
of
world-class
combatants.
Hmmm.
The
rowdy
band
of
summoners
who
had
besieged
my
ears
since
I
arrived
did
prove
of
some
use
in
suppressing
the
plant.
Descending
to
the
Field
,
they
managed
to
overwhelm
it
with
magic,
though
I’m
sure
it
would
have
surrendered
voluntarily
if
exposed
to
their
incessant
conversation.
One
Noxian
summoner
even
saw
fit
to
destroy
the
poor
tree,
but
he
was
restrained
by
the
others
–
a
sideshow
far
more
entertaining
than
the
match.
The
tree
was
quickly
whisked
away
to
receive
the
League's
patented
poking
and
prodding,
and
I
departed
quickly
while
others
lingered
to
discuss
how
they
suddenly
found
something
worth
discussing.
I
later
learned
that
a
lowly
minion
summoner
had
given
the
earliest
warning,
stating
that
one
of
the
nexuses
seemed
to
destabilize
for
a
moment
just
before
the
old
oak
made
his
debut.
The
League
has
issued
assurances
that
the
nexus
has
been
examined
and
is
thoroughly
unlikely
to
explode,
animate
further
flora,
or
otherwise
kill
you
in
your
sleep.
All
in
all,
the
night
will
remain
in
my
memory
as
one
marked
by
a
lack
of
disappointment.
(Though
it
withers
next
to
the
teeth-clenched,
vein-popped
expression
on
Farnsley’s
face
when
he
was
forced
to
request
that
I
write
this
article.)
The
Eye
Inside
Get
well,
Ram
Steed
!
Henril
Dreving
commenting
from
Demacia
As
you
have
already
noticed,
I
am
not
Ram
Steed.
Ram
still
lies
unconscious
on
his
bed
at
the
Mercy
Sanitarium
in
Demacia
.
The
injuries
he
suffered
at
the
hands
of
the
Demon
Jester,
Shaco
,
have
healed,
but
he
still
hasn't
woken
up.
It's
as
if
the
deep
stab
wounds
have
ruptured
his
very
will
to
live.
Some
days,
it
seems
as
if
his
restless
spirit
longs
to
come
back
into
this
world.
On
others,
it
seems
as
if
it
is
ready
to
leave.
Fortunately,
those
close
to
him
have
not
left
his
side
during
this
ordeal.
Hopefully
there
is
something
in
him
that
feels
that
love
and
wants
to
come
back
to
it.
This
is
man
who
is
willing
to
suffer
for
his
journalistic
integrity.
Fans
asked
him
to
find
and
interview
Shaco
and,
despite
knowing
the
risks,
Ram
would
not
stop
until
he
had
that
interview.
There
are
many
who
claim
that
he
is
nothing
more
than
a
glorified
gossip
columnist
(and
those
that
say
even
worse),
but
Ram
Steed
is
the
kind
of
reporter
that
has
proven
that
he
is
willing
to
put
his
life
on
the
line
for
the
people.
Reporting
on
the
comings
and
goings
of
the
League's
champions
seems
insignificant
right
now.
I'm
quite
certain
that
I
couldn't
do
Ram
Steed's
column
justice,
so
I
won't
even
try.
Instead,
let's
look
at
some
of
the
letters
of
support
that
we've
received
regarding
this
tragedy.
“Speedy
recovery,
Steed.
I
wish
you
all
the
best!
Oh,
and
I
hope
you
don’t
believe
that
a
voluntary
interview
with
Shaco
qualifies
for
our
wager
about
who
would
be
shanked
first.”
–
L.
B.
Briskes
“That
Shaco’s
barmier
than
a
sailor
in
love
with
a
sea
cow!
Best
from
all
your
mates
down
in
Bilgewater
!”
–
Cpt.
Morgan
Rackham
“I
think
the
universe
has
a
way
of
setting
itself
right.
Ram’s
interview
is
the
perfect
example
of
that.”
–
Bob
Nashahago
“OMG
BRO
ARE
YOU
OK!??”
–
Vanwoot
“It
seems
like
in
your
interview
with
Shaco
that
instead
of
asking
10
questions
you
asked
11
questions.
this
could
of
lead
to
Shaco
stabbing
you
cause
of
it.”

"Ramsteed,
Ramsteed,
Ramsteed.
Such
a
pity
you
may
have
missed
the
punchline.
But
fair
chance
I
say
since
chance
you
played,
for
did
you
merely
expect
a
judicator
of
death
to
give
you
anything
less
than
what
you
should
expect.
Haha!
Haha!"
–
Gundamwing
“You
have
interviewed
Shaco
as
requested
by
Stimraug,
and
now
it
seems
you
may
have
to
pay
with
your
life.
Be
strong
and
hold
on
to
life!
Without
you,
the
Journal
of
Justice
wouldn’t
be
half
as
good.
I
have
been
following
the
Journal
for
a
while
now.
I
look
forward
to
every
new
issue,
and
now
Shaco
attempts
to
murder
you?
I
hope
that
the
Summoners
of
Valoran
will
stop
summoning
Shaco
in
the
future.
People
who
do
should
be
banished
from
Runeterra
.
I
am
certain
that
Shaco
will
receive
his
just
punishment.
Thank
you
for
doing
what
you
do
for
the
readers
of
the
Journal
of
Justice.
Be
well
soon!“

I

If

Large
Explosion
Blows
Crater
in
Road
Outside
Demacia
Invention
by
League
Champion
Heimerdinger
blamed
for
accidental
blast
Newton
Rook
reporting
from
Demacia
Efforts
to
repair
the
road
outside
the
Eastern
Victory
Gates
began
today
in
Demacia
after
a
magical
explosion
blew
open
a
crater
late
last
week.
The
blast
reportedly
came
from
an
overburdened
rocket-cart
operated
by
League
Champion
Heimerdinger
as
he
drove
away
from
the
famous
Demacian
monument.
According
to
Demacia
Security
Captain
Dolan
Bladewalker,
Heimerdinger
was
given
special
permission
to
leave
the
city
only
minutes
before
the
blast.
“As
part
of
Demacian
security
regulations,
city
entrance
checkpoints
are
outfitted
with
Piltovian
Techmaturgical
Sensors,”
he
said
in
an
interview
with
the
Journal
of
Justice.
“Heimerdinger’s
cart
spiked
off
the
charts!
Galio
happened
to
be
there
as
part
of
a
security
checkpoint
inspection,
and
he
volunteered
to
escort
Heimerdinger
out
as
fast
as
possible.”
Witnesses
say
that
Galio
accompanied
Heimerdinger
300
meters
down
the
road
leading
east
from
Demacia
when
the
vehicle
began
to
emit
smoke
and
a
high-pitched
whistling
sound.
The
Revered
Inventor
waved
his
arms
and
leapt
from
the
vehicle
as
Galio
immediately
shepherded
away
several
pedestrians
who
were
walking
past.
The
explosion
occurred
minutes
later,
blowing
open
a
hole
in
the
ground
that
spanned
the
entire
width
of
the
road.
No
injuries
were
reported.
Demacian
authorities
say
that
Heimerdinger’s
construction
team
was
given
permission
to
assist
with
the
repairs
as
part
of
his
commitment
to
maintaining
good
relations
with
the
city-state.
A
group
of
yordles
wearing
the
logo
of
Piltover
Customs,
Heimerdinger’s
workshop,
on
their
suits
appeared
on
the
scene
yesterday.
Luxanna
Crownguard
and
Heimerdinger
were
assessing
the
damage
with
Demacian
surveyors
when
they
arrived.
Heimerdinger
made
a
statement
soon
after
the
event:
“Months
of
experiments
wasted!
The
techmaturgical
frequencies
emitted
by
that
security
checkpoint
clearly
conflicted
with
the
delicate
forces
enchanting
my
new
D.O.O.M.
machine!
However,
I
absolutely
apologize
for
the
destruction.”
The
inventor
continued
on
to
explain
why
he
was
building
a
“D.O.O.M”
machine
in
Demacia:
“Demacia
is
located
next
to
rare
crystals
that
act
as
naturally
inverted
energy
capacitors.
They
suck
the
magic
right
out
of
you!
Anywhere
else,
I’d
have
to
artificially
simulate
the
process.
Naturally,
I
set
up
a
workshop
at
Demacia
to
expedite
my
work.
It
was
when
the
explosive
properties
of
my
experiment
became
apparent
that
I
decided
it
was
best
to
take
it
out
of
the
city.
By
the
way,
it
isn’t
‘Doom
Machine’;
it’s
D.O.O.M.
machine–or
Drain
Out
Of
Mana
machine.”
Luxanna
Crownguard
made
a
follow-up
statement
about
the
event:
“We’ve
had
our
differences
on
the
League
battlefield
at
times,
but
Heimerdinger
is
always
welcome
in
our
city.
If
he
wants
to
continue
his
experiments,
however,
we
ask
that
he
clear
it
with
Demacian
officials
first.”
The
yordle
maintenance
team
is
expected
to
finish
repairs
by
the
coming
weekend
with
the
assistance
of
Demacian
road
workers.
When
asked
if
he
planned
to
restart
his
experiment,
Heimerdinger
replied:
“Perhaps
sometime
in
the
future.
Unfortunately,
this
work
has
already
taken
much
of
my
time,
and
I
must
be
off
to
research
a
new
idea:
how
to
turn
the
lights
off
with
magic!”

Senior
Summoner
Ralston
Farnsley
commenting
from
the
Institute
of
War
Too
often
I
feel
I
must
take
this
opportunity
to
send
my
thoughts
out
to
those
suffering
in
the
world.
I’ve
even
been
told
that
there
will
never
be
an
end
to
pain,
and
that
I
ought
to
consider
favoring
more
pleasant
topics.
However,
I
firmly
believe
that
the
road
to
a
better
society
is
paved
with
empathy,
diligence,
and
the
pursuit
of
truth,
be
it
beautiful
or
ugly.
These
are
the
qualities
I
strive
to
promote
in
the
Journal
of
Justice
and
its
staff.
With
this
said,
our
thoughts
go
out
to
the
families
of
the
Demacian
miners
trapped
in
Kalamanda
.
We
wish
for
nothing
more
than
their
safe
return.
“Is
there
any
way
to
recover
Sona's
voice?
Every
time
I
summon
her
she
talks
to
me
in
my
head
and
I
find
her
voice
very
lovable
I
was
wondering
if
there
was
any
way
to
help
her?”
–
Summoner
Anybody
Since
her
rise
to
fame,
many
doctors
and
mages
have
offered
to
help
Sona
recover
her
voice.
Some
have
even
taken
steps
to
determine
the
cause
of
her
mutism
through
divination,
although
to
no
avail.
Sona
has
always
maintained
the
same
stance
on
the
issue:
anything
she
wants
to
say
can
be
expressed
through
her
instrument.
In
fact,
she
has
written
that
the
most
wonderful
part
of
conversing
through
her
music
is
that
the
true
meaning
is
never
lost
or
misinterpreted,
as
can
sometimes
happen
with
words.
On
more
than
one
occasion,
she
has
stated
that
her
mutism
is
both
a
gift
and
a
defining
aspect
of
her
character.
“I
am
a
simple
summoner
with
a
huge
problem.
I
have
a
crush
on
Irelia
.
Why
is
this
a
problem?
Well
I
am
a
Noxian
and
this
star-crossed
romance
is
not
meant
to
be.
So
my
real
question
is
to
Irelia:
If
I
were
to
switch
sides...could
we
maybe
go
on
a
date
or
something?”
–
Logano
Well,
the
ladies
of
the
League
are
certainly
no
strangers
to
admirers,
and
typically
these
sorts
of
questions
go
unanswered.
However,
I
happened
to
run
into
Irelia,
and
I
mentioned
your
letter
in
passing.
She
requested
that
I
publish
a
response:
“Dear
Logano,
I’m
flattered
that
you
would
voice
your
feelings,
and
that
you
look
beyond
the
outdated
cultural
barriers
between
our
city-states.
I
would
never
ask
a
person
to
betray
their
beliefs
or
loyalties
for
me.
I
have
suffered
greatly
at
the
hands
of
certain
Noxians,
but
no
person
is
defined
by
their
banner,
only
by
the
choices
he
or
she
makes.
This
said,
I
must
confess
that
my
heart
is
taken.
By
who?
That
will
be
my
little
secret,
at
least
until
I’m
caught
by
Mr.
Steed.”
“Although
the
burning
monk
has
sustained
several
injuries,
I
would
like
to
know
if
there
is
news
of
his
recovery.
Was
he
able
to
regain
his
eyesight
or
does
he
have
new
"methods"
of
seeing
the
world?
Has
his
recovery
been
rapid
or
is
there
still
room
to
go?
I
understand
that
his
fellow
monks
are
skilled
in
healing
martial
arts
but
details
would
be
nice.”

The
monks
of
the
Shojin
monastery
have
actually
kept
very
tight-lipped
about
the
whole
affair.
The
monk
who
immolated
himself
has
been
sealed
away
since
the
event.
Though
I
haven’t
been
able
to
get
distinct
details,
I’m
led
to
believe
that
he
has
not
gotten
his
vision
back.
Publicly,
all
he
has
stated
is
the
following:
“The
only
vision
I
sought
was
one
of
a
free
Ionia
.
That
I
live
to
‘see’
it
is
more
glorious
than
anything
my
eyes
ever
beheld.”
Beyond
that,
I
do
know
that
his
health
is
stable,
and
there
are
rumors
that
he
learned
something
during
his
dramatic
protest
that
has
changed
him,
although
the
story
gets
fuzzy
beyond
that.
