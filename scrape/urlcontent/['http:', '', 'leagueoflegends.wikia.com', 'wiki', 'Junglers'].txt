This
map
shows
all
monster
camps
Jungling
is
considered
a
position
much
like
the
lanes
involving
killing
neutral
"Monsters"
located
on
the
maps
between
the
lanes.
Junglers
dedicate
themselves
to
the
farm
available
in
the
Jungle.
Jungle
refers
to
any
area
of
the
map
that
is
not
a
lane
or
part
of
either
team's
base,
including
the
river
that
divides
it.
Jungling
is
a
role
limited
to
Summoner's
Rift
,
and
to
a
lesser
extent
the
Twisted
Treeline
,
which
is
limited
and
not
as
major
a
part
of
team
strategy
due
to
the
small
size
of
the
map
and
the
jungle
providing
less
consistent
farm.

Monsters
A
Monster
is
a
particular
classification
of
unit.
Unlike
Minions
,
Monsters
are
neutral
(they
do
not
fight
for
either
team),
have
a
level
based
on
the
average
champion
level,
and
will
not
automatically
attack
a
champion
unless
they
are
attacked.
As
their
level
goes
up,
so
does
their
reward
gold
and
exp
along
with
their
damage
and
survivability
stats.
The
table
in
Jungling
Overview
goes
into
greater
detail.
With
the
exception
of
boss
Monsters,
Monsters
do
not
increase
in
level
(stats)
until
after
they
have
re-spawned.
Certain
monsters
offer
greater
rewards,
like
a
buff
or
a
"global"
reward.
Some
of
the
buffs
granted
are
transferrable
to
enemy
killer
champions.
Monsters
will
not
move
from
their
designated
camp
until
attacked,
in
which
case
the
monster
will
move
towards
and
attack
the
nearest
champion,
up
to
a
certain
distance
from
its
spawning
point
("leash"
distance);
if
the
monster
is
unable
to
attack
any
target
or
reaches
its
leash
range,
it
will
walk
back
to
its
original
spawn
point,
rapidly
regenerating
to
its
full
health.
If
attacked
on
its
way
back,
it
tries
again
to
attack
a
champion.
Since
monsters
attack
the
nearest
champion,
they
can
select
a
new
target
after
having
attacked.
There
is
an
internal
counter
for
these
target
changes,
and
after
having
changed
targets
10
times,
a
monster
will
return
to
its
spawning
point
even
if
attacked,
regenerating
its
full
health
at
a
high
rate.
Monsters
will
not
immediately
"forget"
champions
that
hide
in
bushes,
and
try
to
walk
into
the
bush
to
attack.
A
monster
that
can
see
a
champion
provides
vision
of
this
champion
to
all
of
the
monsters
in
its
camp.
If
a
champion
is
killed
by
a
Monster,
both
teams
are
notified
with
the
announcer
stating
"Executed"
and
text
indicating
which
champion
and
what
Monster
killed
him.
Notes:
There
is
a
current
bug
that
occurs
when
a
monster
camp
is
attacked
but
not
killed.
After
the
minions
return
to
their
original
locations,
ranged
monsters
may
begin
to
fire
continuous
streams
of
their
missile
(eg,
the
Young
Lizard
will
shoot
several
copies
of
its
fireball,
creating
a
huge
trail
of
fire)
in
the
direction
of
the
last
attacker,
but
deal
no
damage.
Basis
of
Jungling
The
primary
reason
for
Jungling
is
resource
allocation.
The
jungle
offers
a
lot
of
gold
and
experience
that
can
be
accessed
through
slaying
the
monsters
that
spawn
and
respawn
in
predetermined
locations
on
the
map.
With
a
lone
player
dedicating
himself
to
accruing
it,
it
leaves
two
solo
lanes
available
to
both
gain
high
experience
and
gold
rather
than
only
one
solo
lane.
In
effect,
all
accessible
resources
are
being
utilized
by
a
team
with
a
jungler.
There
are
other
important
tasks
that
a
jungler
is
expected
to
perform,
due
to
their
roaming
nature
preventing
enemy
champions
from
spotting
the
jungler
through
the
fog
of
war.
This
allows
for
unexpected
positioning
and
surprise
attacks,
mainly
through
the
use
of
ganks.
Their
ability
to
freely
traverse
the
map
without
being
tied
to
a
lane
also
allows
them
to
support
lanes
when
in
the
area,
such
as
warding
key
locations
without
forcing
someone
else
to
abandon
their
lane
and
coming
to
an
ally's
aid
when
they
come
under
duress.
The
final
reason
for
Jungling
is
the
security
of
the
two
epic
monsters
on
the
map,
Baron
Nashor
and
the
Dragon
.
Because
of
the
potentially
game-turning
advantages
these
two
monsters
can
give
to
a
team
that
successfully
kills
them,
it
is
often
a
responsibility
of
the
jungler
to
ensure
that
these
camps
are
not
acquired
by
a
marauding
enemy
team
by
using
Smite
to
secure
or
steal
the
camp
at
the
last
second.
Jungle
Overview
On
Summoner's
Rift
there
are
14
monster
camps:
Blue
and
Purple
jungles
have
an
equal
area
with
the
same
amount
of
non-boss
monsters.
The
jungle
is
effectively
perfectly
rotationally
symmetrical
about
the
center
of
the
map,
with
the
exceptions
of
Dragon
and
Baron
Nashor,
who
are
unique.
They
each
reside
in
sheltered
alcoves
along
the
river
and
are
accessible
from
different
directions,
making
them
slightly
easier
to
access
for
the
team
on
the
side
they
are
open
to;
blue
team
has
superior
access
to
Baron
Nashor
and
purple
team
has
superior
Dragon
access.
On
Twisted
Treeline
there
are
7
camps.
It
is
Mirrored
from
the
center
with
the
top
camp,
above
top
lane,
having
Vilemaw.
This
table
lists
the
initial
statistics
each
monster
grants,
or
the
value
of
gold
and
experience
granted
when
the
monsters
are
at
level
1
(6
for
the
Dragon
).
Over
time
the
monsters
will
grant
additional
rewards;
Monsters
will
level
up
after
having
been
killed,
except
Dragon,
Baron,
and
Vilemew,
who
will
level
throughout
the
game.
Check
the
individual
monster
pages
to

these
level
up
values.

All
jungle
monsters
(with
the
exception
of
Baron
Nashor
)
can
grant
additional
experience
if
the
level
of
the
champion
killing
them
is
lower
than
that
of
the
monster.
This
bonus
caps
out
at
200%
for
the
Dragon
,
and
50%
extra
for
non-boss
mobs,
making
farming
the
jungle
for
a
brief
period
useful
in
temporarily
recovering
from
a
poor
early
game.
Respawn
timers
on
the
camps
do
not
begin
to
count
down
until
all
monsters
in
the
camp
have
been
killed,
including
the
major
buff
camps.
This
can
be
exploited
by
a
jungler
looking
to
steal
his
opponent's
experience
by
leaving
a
single
minor
monster
behind
to
deny
the
enemy
jungler
his
farm
and
experience
for
as
long
as
possible.
Champions
of
the
Jungle
The
champions
who
regularly
are
seen
in
the
jungle
role
often
tend
to
be
categorized
with
one
another
to
show
that
many
champions
will
use
the
same
overarching
playstyle.
Some
champions
can
belong
in
more
than
one
category,
although
such
champions
often
tend
to
be
worse
at
either
role
than
dedicated
champions
of
only
one
type.
Knowledge
of
which
group(s)
a
given
champion
belongs
in
can
go
a
long
way
in
predicting
how
that
champion
will
build
and
behave
in
a
match.
It
should
be
noted
that
such
categorizations
show
only
how
the
champion
is
likely
to
act
as
a
jungler
,
and
are
often
distinct
from
how
the
champion
is
likely
to
act
as
a
pick
.
There
are
generally
agreed
to
be
three
recognized
types
of
jungler
in
League
of
Legends:
A
ganking
jungler
aims
to
contribute
to
his
team
by
providing
constant
pressure
to
enemy
laners
and
setting
up
kills
for
their
allies,
allowing
them
to
snowball
their
way
to
victory
even
as
the
ganker
jungler
falls
behind
in
gold
due
to
generally
low
farm.
Such
junglers
often
tend
to
prioritize
heavy
crowd
control
and
mobility
in
their
kit,
which
allows
them
to
reach
even
the
most
heavily-entrenched
laners
and
lock
them
down
long
enough
to
ensure
their
demise.
Ganker
junglers
tend
to
be
good
picks
against
farming
junglers,
as
without
the
need
to
worry
about
an
opponent
intercepting
a
gank
attempt
they
can
freely
roam
and
harass
opposing
laners
with
no
fear
of
reprisal.
Examples
of
ganking
junglers
include
Jarvan
IV
and
Rengar
.
A
farming
jungler
does
what
their
title
implies
-
they
spend
the
vast
majority
of
their
time
farming
the
camps
that
respawn
in
the
jungle,
and
will
also
often
supplement
this
income
by
entering
an
ally's
lane
and
farming
enemy
minions
as
well.
This
type
of
jungler
sacrifices
aiding
their
laners
in
the
early
game
with
the
intent
of
getting
large
amounts
of
gold
and
levels
to
become
a
significant
threat
in
the
late
game,
and
often
boast
very
high
damage
output
and
strong
scaling,
allowing
them
to
farm
the
jungle
at
maximum
speed
and
effectively
become
a
second
carry
if
they
are
allowed
to
farm
for
long
enough.
Farmer
junglers
tend
to
resist
control
junglers,
who
more
often
than
not
will
simply
not
be
able
to
steal
camps
at
a
rate
that
is
able
to
compete
with
the
high
clearing
speed
of
their
opponent
and
usually
end
up
outscaled
by
their
better
farmed
opponent.
Examples
of
farming
junglers
include
Shyvana
and
Master
Yi
.
Control
junglers
are
aimed
specifically
at
defeating
other
junglers
and
ensuring
that
they
have
as
little
influence
as
possible
through
the
course
of
a
game,
and
assist
their
allies
mainly
though
use
of
objective
control,
such
as
using
early
takedowns
of
the
Dragon
and
the
two
major
buff
camps
on
both
sides.
This
type
of
jungler
can
be
very
varied
in
their
design
but
most
of
them
will
prioritize
sustainability
or
dueling
potential
as
their
key
stats,
allowing
them
to
defeat
other
junglers
through
both
attrition
and
raw
power
if
needs
be.
Control
junglers
are
counterpicks
to
ganking
junglers,
as
their
stalking
nature
allows
them
to
nullify
their
opponent's
strengths
by
ensuring
their
ganks
do
not
succeed,
as
well
as
crippling
what
little
farm
they
already
get.
Examples
of
control
junglers
include
Nunu
and
Trundle
.
Runes
and
Masteries
There
are
a
few
common
setups
used
to
increase
a
jungler's
potential:
Seals
Greater
Seal
of
Armor
(+1.
41
armor
)
These
seals
are
more
or
less
mandatory
on
any
jungler
as
they
sharply
reduce
the
damage
taken
from
neutral
creeps,
resulting
in
higher
end
health
and
opening
more
options
for
their
next
move.
Marks
Greater
Mark
of
Armor
Penetration
(+1.
28
armor
penetration
)
Greater
Mark
of
Attack
Damage
(+0.
95
attack
damage
)
Greater
Mark
of
Attack
Speed
(+1.
67
%
attack
speed
)
The
choice
of
marks
generally
aims
to
increase
the
jungler's
offensive
prowess
and
improve
their
clearing
speeds.
Even
champions
whose
playstyles
and
builds
do
not
especially
benefit
from
any
of
these
will
still
usually
take
marks
of
attack
speed
to
make
the
most
use
of
the
Maim
passive
of
Hunter's
Machete
,
as
marks
provide
only
marginal
bonuses
to
non-autoattack
related
statistics.
Glyphs
Greater
Glyph
of
Scaling
Magic
Resist
(+2.
7
magic
resistance

Level

Greater
Glyph

Cooldown
Reduction
(+0.
56
%
cooldown
reduction
per
level)
Greater
Glyph
of
Ability
Power
(+1.
19
ability

).
Glyph
choices
are
usually
aimed
at
augmenting
the
later
stages
of
the
game
for
the
jungler.
Magic
resistance
per
level
is
the
usual
choice
as
it
allows
many
junglers
to
purchase
armor
for
their
duties
without
needing
to
worry
too
much
about
magic
damage.
Cooldown
reduction
per
level
glyphs
are
instead
for
the
few
champions
who
have
very
long
cooldowns
and
do
not
intend
to
incorporate
lots
of
cooldown
reduction
items
into
their
build.
Ability
power
glyphs
are
for
mage
junglers
whose
primary
clearing
abilities
scale
with
this
stat.
Quintessences
Greater
Quintessence
of
Movement
Speed
(+1.
5

)
Greater

Greater

(+3.
33

)
Greater
Quintessence

95
ability

)
Quintessences
function
as
wild
cards
and
can
provide
any
kind
of
benefit
the
jungler
wishes.
Movement
speed
is
extremely
common
and
offers
large
improvements
to
ganking
potential,
while
other
rune
types
are
usually
aimed
at
improving
the
speed
or
sustain
of
the
jungler
instead.

Items
for
Jungling
History
of
Jungling
Items
Jungler
itemization
has
gone
through
some
considerable
changes
over
the
course
of
League
of
Legends
'
lifespan.
During
Season
One
,
the
jungle
was
a
highly
profitable
source
of
gold,
so
much
so
that
often
a
Jungling
champion
could
even
obtain
more
farm
than
the
lanes
with
some
effort,
eventually
letting
them
afford
expensive
and
deadly
items
if
their
farming
efforts
were
not
halted.
This
was
offset
by
the
enormous
difficulty
of
the
jungle
monsters
of
the
time
-
there
were
extremely
few
junglers
who
could
even
clear
effectively
in
such
an
rigorous
environment
and
even
fewer
junglers
who
could
begin
the
game
with
anything
other
than
a
Cloth
Armor
and
5
Health
Potions
.
The
jungle
rework
of
Season
Two
reduced
the
difficulty
of
the
jungle
monsters
and
the
gold
and
experience
that
they
gave
out
in
an
attempt
to
open
the
jungle
to
more
prospective
champions.
Despite
the
decreased
monster
health,
however,
it
was
found
that
the
decreased
gold
meant
that
dedicated
farming
was
simply
no
longer
an
economically
viable
strategy,
and
many
junglers
were
forced
to
find
alternative
solutions
to
the
resultant
gold
starvation
(most
often
amounting
to
early
stacking
of
gold
generating
items
such
as
Philosopher's
Stone
and
Heart
of
Gold
),
while
other
junglers
whose
core
item
builds
often
demanded
a
high
gold
income
to
be
feasible
simply
could
not
function
in
such
a
low-gold
environment.
The
jungle
in
Season
Three
attempted
to
compromise
between
the
high
farm
of
Season
One
and
the
low
difficulty
of
Season
Two.
The
introduction
of
Hunter's
Machete
allowed
many
junglers
to
successfully
clear
without
many
sustain
issues
and
offered
fallback
solutions
in
the
form
of
the
highly
gold
efficient
items
it
built
into
in
case
of
a
poor
early
game,
and
the
increase
to
passive
gold
generation
saw
most
junglers
in
possession
of
at
least
passable
amounts
of
gold.
These
changes
saw
the
number
of
viable
junglers
increase
greatly.
The
current
iteration
of
Season
Four
was
built
upon
the
framework
set
by
Season
Three,
with
several
gameplay
refinements
aimed
at
combating
issues
seen
at
higher
levels
of
play.
Of
particular
note,
all
of
the
high-tier
jungle
items
now
provide
benefits
exclusively
involving
killing
monsters
and
an
entirely
new
jungle
monster,
the
Wight
,
was
introduced,
enabling
much
higher
potential
profits
to
both
farming
junglers
who
are
sufficiently
fast
to
keep
up
with
the
respawn
times
of
the
four
camps
and
ganking
junglers
who
do
not
perform
well
early
on.
The
most
common
setup
when
starting
a
jungle
game
is
a
Hunter's
Machete
and
5
Health
Potions
.
This
setup
greatly
improves
jungle
clearing
speed
and
provides
750
bonus
health
to
cover
early
health
losses.
Junglers
that
intend
to
play
an
extremely
aggressive
early
game,
however,
can
be
seen
to
start
with
a
Doran's
Blade
and
Health
Potions
instead
in
order
to
maximize
their
offensive
capabilities.
A
rare
few
junglers
may
also
opt
to
start
with
Boots
of
Speed
and
4
Health
Potions
,
which
provides
movement
speed
to
improve
ganks
as
well
as
600
health
to
get
through
the
first
few
levels.
It
can
be
used
both
on
highly
sustained
junglers
who
do
not
need
clearing
assistance
(eg.
Warwick
)
or
champions
who
focus
more
on
heavily
ganking
enemy
laners
(eg.
Shaco
).
The
majority
of
champions
who
purchase
Hunter's
Machete
will
typically
be
best
served
by
upgrading
into
a
Spirit
Stone
,
which
provides
large
regeneration
stats
and
an
increased
bonus
damage
percentage
to
aid
general
clearing,
and
also
has
three
useful
upgrades
which
can
be
tailored
to
fit
the
Jungling
champion.
For
farming
junglers
who
intend
to
bolster
their
clear
times
as
much
as
possible
and
maximize
the
farm
gained
from
monsters,
Hunter's
Machete
can
be
upgraded
to
Madred's
Razors
for
its
large
magic
damage
proc
and
further
built
into
Wriggle's
Lantern
to
gain
even
more
speed
and
provide
a
massive
gold
bonus.
As
the
jungler
is
often
expected
to
spend
a
large
amount
of
time
roaming
the
map
between
camps
and
lanes,
Boots
of
Mobility
are
a
useful
purchase
to
lessen
the
considerable
travel
time,
particularly
for
junglers
who
can
invest
in
a
Spirit
of
the
Ancient
Golem
to
provide
their
tenacity
statistic.
If
this
is
not
possible
and
tenacity
is
desired,
Mercury's
Treads
and
Ninja
Tabi
are
good
alternatives
which
also
provides
early
magic
resistance
or
armor
.
Boots
of
Swiftness
are
the
next
most
common
option,
providing
high
movement
speed
and
a
resistance
to
slowing
effects
which
greatly
aids
ganking
potential.
Common
Jungle
Routes
A
jungle
route
is
the
order
in
which
a
Jungling
champion
will
tackle
each
of
the
camps
scattered
around
the
map
during
their
very
first
clear.
Routes
tend
to
vary
from
very
offensive
to
very
passive,
depending
on
the
playstyle
of
the
jungler
in
question
(though
certain
champions
are
more
efficient
with
some
routes
than
others).
Regardless
of
how
aggressive
the
route
is,
each
route
is
optimized
to
provide
the
jungler
with
the
best
balance
of
health
and
time
invested
-
crucial
during
the
earliest
stages
of
a
game
where
many
junglers
are
at
their
weakest
and
most
vulnerable
states.
End
level:
2
Route:
Lizard
Elder
camp
(
Smite
)
Gank
a
nearby
lane.
This
extremely
aggressive
jungle
route
is
the
riskiest
out
of
all
jungle
routes
and
is
most
often
used
in
an
attempt
to
obtain
the
First
Blood
bonus
before
opponents
have
had
a
chance
to
acquire
all
of
their
spells
yet.
On
some
junglers,
this
also
sacrifices
some
potential
at
farming
for
early
increased
offensive
prowess.
Failure
to
acquire
a
kill
can
often
leave
the
jungler
dangerously
behind
on
experience
and
farm
and
will
leave
them
vulnerable
to
harassment
for
several
minutes,
but
a
successful
gank
can
be
greatly
rewarding,
granting
the
killer's
team
680
gold
(400G
for
the
kill
+
70%
for
the
assist)
and
setting
the
slain
opponent
back
on
both
experience
and
gold
at
a
very
early
stage,
which
can
easily
become
an
insurmountable
disadvantage.
End
level:
3
Route:
Ancient
Golem
camp
(
Smite
)
Minor
camp
Lizard
Elder
camp
(
Smite
)
Gank
a
nearby
lane
Alternatively:
Lizard
Elder
camp
(
Smite
)
Ancient
Golem
camp
Minor
camp
(
Smite
)
Gank
a
nearby
lane.
This
route
is
one
of
them
most
commonly
taken
paths,
done
to
strategically
both
prevent
theft
of
the
buff
camps
by
the
opposing
team
and
gain
a
fast
level
advantage
over
opposing
champions.
This
leaves
multiple
useful
options
for
the
Jungling
champion,
including
being
able
to
gank
a
nearby
lane,
invade
the
opposing
jungle
or
simply
to
continue
farming.
The
choice
of
minor
camp
can
vary
depending
in
the
jungler
in
question,
with
the
usual
options
being
the
Wraith
,
Wolf
and
Wight
camp.
Junglers
with
strong
area
of
effect
abilities
will
be
most
efficient
clearing
one
of
the
former
two
camps,
while
junglers
with
strong
single-target
damage
will
benefit
more
from
killing
the
Wight
.
End
level:
4
Route:
Ancient
Golem
camp
(
Smite
)
Wight
camp
Giant
Wolf
camp
Wraith
camp
Lizard
Elder
camp
(
Smite
)
Golem
camp
Gank
a
nearby
lane.
Alternatively:
Lizard
Elder
camp
(
Smite
)
Wraith
camp
Giant
Wolf
camp
Ancient
Golem
camp
(
Smite
)
Wight
camp
Giant
Wolf
camp
Gank
a
nearby
lane.
This
route
is
a
well-rounded
route
that
equally
balances
ganking
potential,
farming
experience
and
gold,
and
is
useful
for
junglers
who
do
not
have
strong
ganking
prowess
at
very
early
levels,
as
it
provides
enough
experience
for
them
to
get
their
primary
skill
to
level
2
instead
of
level
1.
Depending
upon
the
speed
of
the
jungler
champion,
Smite
can
be
used
to
differing
levels
of
effectiveness.
On
the
very
slowest
junglers
it
is
actually
possible
to
Smite
back-to-back
camps
(such
as
the
Wight
and
Ancient
Golem
),
although
is
usually
advisable
to
ensure
it
is
available
when
taking
a
major
buff
camp
to
avoid
dealing
with
their
high
damage
output
for
too
long.
End

Repeat
the
last
four
steps
over
and
over
as
necessary.
This
passive
route
is
chosen
to
maximize
gold
and
experience
income
from
the
jungle
at
the
expense
of
supporting
the
lanes.
This
route
is
usually
used
by
very
fast
farming
junglers
who
want
to
earn
their
gold
through
farming,
but
can
also
be
used
with
junglers
who
have
high
level
requirements
to
be
able
to
gank
effectively
and
wish
to
speed
themselves
to
that
point.
Ganking
Ganking
refers
to
the
act
of
ambushing
one
or
more
players
with
the
intent
of
scoring
a
kill.
It
is
one
of
the
most
important
aspects
of
the
jungle
role,
as,
while
anyone
in
a
match
can
effectively
gank
to
some
extent,
the
jungler
is
the
champion
who
has
the
greatest
capacity
to
do
so
as
he
is
not
bound
to
any
particular
lane,
allowing
him
to
freely
roam
across
the
map
to
appear
wherever
he
is
needed.
As
the
game
progresses
and
more
and
more
champions
begin
to
roam
the
map
and
band
together
as
opposed
to
extending
out
alone,
ganking
becomes
less
limited
to
the
jungler
and
less
of
an
important
factor
to
success
overall,
but
nonetheless
remains
an
important
element
of
team
strategy
all
the
way
up
until
a
game's
end.
Some
champions
are
better
at
ganking
than
others.
In
particular,
champions
with
very
powerful
or
plentiful
crowd
control
tend
to
be
stronger
at
ganks
than
those
without.
For
example,
Shaco
can
gank
a
lane
as
early
as
level
2
with
only
a
Lizard
Elder
buff
for
aid
-
the
slow
it
provides
and
the
fear
from
a
Jack
In
The
Box
can
lock
down
a
enemy
champion
for
several
seconds,
potentially
allowing
Shaco
to
kill
him
before
he
can
escape.
Conversely,
champions
who
have
little
to
no
crowd
control
(such
as
Shyvana
)
or
have
crowd
control
that
can
be
difficult
or
unreliable
to
use
effectively
(such
as
Dr.
Mundo
)
will
often
find
themselves
hard
pressed
to
obtain
kills
during
ganks.
A
few
specific
junglers
may
have
very
poor
initial
ganking,
but
upon
obtaining
their
ultimate
can
later
gank
with
much
more
success.
In
such
cases,
the
Jungling
champion
will
often
focus
solely
on
farming
for
the
early
game
and
later
transition
to
ganking
more
heavily
once
level
6
has
been
reached.
There
are
several
different
types
of
gank
that
can
be
observed
in
League
of
Legends:
Zac
preparing
to
jump
in
on
a
dueling
Sejuani
and
Jax
through
a
river
gank.
River
ganks
are
the
most
common
type
of
gank
and
involves
the
jungler
approaching
a
lane
through
the
river,
entering
the
brush
there
and
beginning
his
assault
on
the
opposing
team
once
correct
positioning
is
established.
This
type
of
gank
is
the
most
readily
available
to
any
jungler
and,
depending
on
the
mobility
of
the
ganking
champion,
can
work
successfully
even
against
opponents
who
have
not
extended
significantly
beyond
their
own
side
brush.
As
a
tradeoff
for
this
ease
of
use,
however,
river
ganks
are
among
the
easiest
to
spot
ahead
of
time
for
a
competent
team
-
a
single
Ward
in
the
river
bush
can
quickly
warn
a
laner
of
the
jungler's
intentions
and
allow
them
to
back
off
and
avoid
danger.
The
other
types
of
ganks
most
often
occur
to
bypass
this
vision
of
the
river.
River
ganks
tend
to
be
more
successful
at
top
lane
for
purple
team
members
and
bot
lane
for
blue
team
members,
but
teams
on
the
opposite
side
have
access
to
the
loop
gank
below
to
compensate.
Nautilus
waiting
for
a
side
gank
opportunity
on
Pantheon
Side
ganks
(also
known
as
a
lane
gank)
involve
the
jungler
entering
the
side
brush
in
order
to
get
very
close
to
his
targets
before
initiating
the
gank.
This
type
of
gank
has
many
more
limitations
than
a
simple
river
gank,
as
it
can
only
be
done
in
bot
or
top
lane
and
relies
on
a
lack
of
vision
on
both
within
the
bush
from
the
enemy
team
and
of
the
jungler
as
he
enters
it
in
order
to
maintain
the
element
of
surprise.
This
gank
is
much
more
commonly
done
at
top
lane
than
at
bot
lane,
as
the
latter
contains
a
support
champion
who
has
the
responsibility
of
keeping
the
side
brush
warded,
but
when
pulled
off
in
either
case
it
can
be
extremely
deadly
due
to
the
sheer
proximity
of
the
ganking
champion
allowing
him
to
almost
immediately
lock
down
his
target
and
prevent
them
from
fleeing.
Jungling
champions
who
do
not
have
strong
blink
or
dash
abilities
(such
as
Udyr
)
will
often
benefit
greatly
from
side
ganks,
as
their
mobility
issues
become
irrelevant
at
such
close
ranges.
Xin
Zhao
sneaking
up
on
an
unaware
Katarina
in
a
loop
gank.
Loop
ganks
involve
the
champion
entering
the
enemy
jungle
from
near
the
mid
lane,
and
(for
bot
or
top
lane
loop
ganks)
walking
around
the
Dragon
or
Baron
Nashor
spawning
pit
and
entering
the
target
lane
through
the
tribush
or
(for
mid
lane
loop
ganks)
making
use
of
the
entrances
to
the
lane
on
the
same
side
as
an
enemy
turret.
Loop
ganks
pose
some
significant
risks
to
the
jungler.
If
their
initial
approach
into
the
enemy
jungle
is
spotted
early
on
with
a
ward,
it
is
almost
always
a
death
sentence,
as
the
opposing
team
can
act
together
to
corner
and
slay
the
champion
as
he
makes
his
way
down
to
the
lane.
If
pulled
off
correctly,
however,
it
can
be
equally
devastating
to
an
unaware
laner,
as
with
the
use
of
the
tribush
to
disguise
their
approach
the
jungler
will
end
up
directly
behind
the
target
and
so
does
not
have
to
immediately
use
their
abilities
to
close
the
gap.
Volibear
and
Twitch
attempting
a
tower
dive
gank
on
Ezreal
.
The
riskiest
gank
to
perform,
this
type
of
gank
involves
the
jungler
collaborating
with
allies
to
trap
and
kill
enemies
who
are
under
the
apparent
safety
of
their
turret
.
This
gank
can
be
done
on
any
laner
through
use
of
the
jungle
-
bot
and
top
lane
for
purple
and
blue
team
respectively
uses
the
path
and
small
brush
directly
behind
the
turret
and
the
opposing
side
makes
use
of
the
grass
near
the
Golem
camp.
Mid
lane
tower
dive
ganks
make
use
of
the
path
near
the
Giant
Wolf
spawns.
Tower
dive
ganks
can
have
massive
consequences
if
part
of
the
dive
is
performed
improperly
due
to
the
presence
of
the
turret,
which
contributes
massive
damage
output
on
a
champion
who
attacks
an
ally
within
its
range.
A
miscommunication
between
members
of
a
team
can
lead
to
one
or
more
allied
champions
being
killed
in
the
dive,
which
can
offset
the
benefits
of
diving
in
the
first
place.
Junglers
who
are
most
suited
to
performing
tower
dive
ganks
are
ones
that
have
abilities
that
can
let
them
easily
tank
several
tower
shots
and
buy
more
time
to
obtain
a
kill
(such
as
Alistar
),
or
ones
who
have
extremely
high
burst
potential,
allowing
them
to
rapidly
decimate
enemy
champions
before
the
tower
can
do
significant
damage
(such
as
Zed
).

dispensing
with
all
form
of
subtlety
and
approaching
his
targets
by
walking
directly
down

lane
towards

with
wards
as
they
do
not
have
an
especially
high
chance
of
success.
Though
this
type
of
gank
is
technically
available
to
all
junglers,
in
practice
only
a
very
specific
few
are
capable
of
successfully
pulling
one
off.
Almost
invariably,
a
direct
ganking
champion
will
boast
enormous
mobility
and
multiple
means
of
closing
the
gap
with
his
opponents
as
well
as
strong
crowd
controls.
A
famous
example
of
such
a
jungler
is
Hecarim
,
who
has
access
to
a
movement
speed-boosting
ability
(
Devastating
Charge
),
a
long-ranged
gap
closer
(
Onslaught
of
Shadows
)
and
a
method
of
movement
impairment
(
Onslaught
of
Shadows
)
which
combine
to
allow
him
to
storm
into
a
lane
at
high
speed
and
quickly
suppress
a
target
champion
before
they
can
escape.
A
counter
gank
is
the
unique
act
of
a
champion
entering
a
lane
where
an
enemy
gank
is
already
in
progress
with
the
intent
of
turning
the
fight
to
their
favor.
This
gank
type
follows
the
same
rules
as
before
in
that
good
warding
can
alert
a
team
to
the
incoming
threat
and
let
them
back
off
without
suffering
casualties,
but
also
equally
depends
on
the
junglers
themselves.
Strong
counterganking
junglers
are
champions
who
have
excellent
map
mobility
and
can
react
quickly
to
a
gank
happening
regardless
of
their
current
location
(such
as
Rammus
and
his
Powerball
).
Junglers
who
are
resistant
to
being
counterganked
themselves
are
champions
whose
methods
of
crowd
control
are
divorced
from
their
methods
of
escape,
letting
them
rapidly
switch
from
attacking
to
retreating
when
the
need
arises
(such
as
Jax
).
Counter-Jungling
Counter-Jungling
is
a
broad
term
which
generally
refers
to
the
act
of
delaying
the
progress
of
an
enemy
jungler
in
some
way.
The
reason
to
perform
this
is
always
the
same
-
it
is
an
attempt
to
reduce
the
influence
the
jungler
has
on
the
game
in
the
next
several
minutes
by
depriving
him
of
gold,
experience
and
neutral
buffs.
It
is
usually
a
strictly
solo
affair
(with
one
particular
exception
being
invasions,
which
are
covered
below)
and
typically
involves
a
jungler
entering
enemy
territory
to
either
steal
unattended
camps,
ambush
his
opponent
with
the
intention
of
killing
him
or
driving
him
off,
or
both.
While
any
champion
can
potentially
do
this,
there
are
champions,
much
like
with
ganking,
who
are
more
suited
to
counter-Jungling
than
others.
Champions
who
specialize
in
stealing
gold
and
experience
are
often
those
who
have
abilities
that
let
them
rapidly
destroy
camps
and
lessen
the
chances
of
discovery.
Champions
who
specialize
in
dueling
and
defeating
an
enemy
jungler
will
almost
always
pack
powerful
offensive
steroids
that
let
them
quickly
overwhelm
an
opponent
in
a
1v1,
as
well
as
the
means
to
prevent
them
from
escaping.
Cho'Gath
and
Trundle
are
two
examples
of
champions
well-suited
to
counter-Jungling.
The
former
boasts
heavy
area
of
effect
damage
and
a
powerful
true
damage
nuke
from
his
Feast
,
letting
him
quickly
destroy
major
and
minor
camps
alike.
The
latter
boasts
enormous
singletarget
damage
from
Chomp
and
Frozen
Domain
affording
him
incredible
dueling
power
against
lone
opponents,
as
well
as
a
means
to
chase
down
and
prevent
their
escape
with
Pillar
of
Ice
.
Counter-Jungling
is
usually
a
very
risky
tactic
due
to
the
potential
hazard
of
being
discovered,
cornered
and
killed
by
an
enemy
team.
As
a
result,
being
able
to
do
well
consistently
with
it
will
necessitate
a
strong
sense
of
map
awareness
and
knowledge
of
champion
matchups.
Champions
who
do
not
wish
to
be
caught
stealing
a
camp
must
often
ensure
that
their
opponent
is
elsewhere
at
the
time,
such
as
when
the
enemy
jungler
is
covering
a
lane
for
someone
or
has
recently
ganked
and
been
forced
to
retreat
at
low
health.
Likewise,
champions
who
wish
to
catch
the
enemy
jungler
in
turn
will
often
need
to
utilise
their
knowledge
to
determine
their
whereabouts
at
a
specific
time
and
whether
it
is
safe
to
attempt
to
kill
them.
Invasions
Invasions
are
a
very
specific
type
of
counter-Jungling,
usually
undertaken
by
all
five
members
of
a
team
in
an
attempt
to
deprive
the
enemy
jungler
of
their
very
first
buff
before
the
minion
waves
have
begun
to
spawn.
This
usually
involves
the
team
utilising
the
bushes
to
stealthily
approach
the
enemy
Ancient
Golem
or
Lizard
Elder
camp.
Most
commonly,
this
is
done
for
the
former
camp
as
several
junglers
must
start
with
the
Crest
of
the
Ancient
Golem
buff
in
order
to
clear
effectively
early
on,
but
for
the
same
reason
stealing
the
Blessing
of
the
Lizard
Elder
usually
has
the
lesser
chance
of
an
early
engagement.
The
presence
of
this
strategy
often
dictates
a
team's
actions
during
the
first
90
seconds
of
a
game
and
is
the
reason
why
many
teammates
will
guard
around
the
river
area
of
the
jungle
to
provide
advance
warning
in
case
of
an
invasion.
Successful
invasions
can
have
great
payoffs,
granting
the
beneficiaries
an
extra
neutral
buff
for
the
first
five
minutes,
buff
camp
experience,
and
potentially
the
First
Blood
bonus
and
early
kills.
Even
invasions
that
are
thwarted
by
good
scouting
can
still
often
be
successful
as
the
enemy
team
may
not
always
be
in
a
good
position
to
drive
off
the
invaders.
Some
team
compositions
can
encourage
or
dissuade
invasions
more
than
others.
Teams
that
have
a
higher
chance
of
a
successful
invade
are
most
commonly
teams
made
of
champions
with
strong
level
1
crowd
controls
(such
as
Zyra's
Grasping
Roots
or
Blitzcrank's
Rocket
Grab
)
who
can
lock
down
off-guard
opponents
and
allow
for
their
team
to
quickly
destroy
them.
