Richard
Hough
hails
from
the
chilly
hills
of
central
NY,
the
frozen
winters
having
driven
him
from
his
parallel
processor
engineering
Ph.D.
at
Cornell
University
into
sunny
California.
Much
of
his
time
is
spent
causing
trouble
for
both
the
engineering
and
design
departments
at
Riot,
using
his
role
as
liaison
between
the
two
as
a
means
to
sneak
awesome
features
into
the
product.
He
holds
a
Masters
in
Computer
Engineering
from
Washington
University
in
St.
Louis,
and
is
the
co-founder
of
Proper
Walrus
LLC.
He
spends
much
of
his
free
time
playing
extremely
obscure
budget
and
indie
games,
and
has
been
known
to
rant
for
hours
about
the
finer
points
of
God
Hand's
and
Deadly
Premonition's
designs.
Special
Ability
Video
Game
Theory
:
Richard's
constant
exposure
to
video
games
allows
him
to
always
pick
the
best
door
of
a
group
of
five,
use
stellar
converters
for
point
defense,
and
impersonate
New
Orleans
police
officers
with
nothing
more
than
a
hat,
jacket,
and
fake
mustache.
