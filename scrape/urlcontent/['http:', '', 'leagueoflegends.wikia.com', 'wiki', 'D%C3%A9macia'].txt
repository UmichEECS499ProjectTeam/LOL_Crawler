Lore
Along
the
western
coast
of
Valoran,
the
human
city-state
of
Demacia
shines
as
the
continent's
paragon
of
virtue
amongst
all
the
other
human
settlements.
The
residents
are
always
striving
to
sharpen
their
bodies
and
minds
in
the
pursuit
of
absolute
justice.
Culture
The
people
of
Demacia
are
driven
by
their
common
cause
to
disseminate
benevolence
and
order
for
the
betterment
of
all
beings
throughout
Valoran.
They
view
malice
and
selfishness
as
a
disease
which
should
be
expunged
from
the
psyche
of
humankind.
Those
who
come
to
Demacia
and
choose
to
settle
within
the
borders
of
the
city-state
are
expected
to
share
the
ideals
and
virtues
of
its
citizenry.
Those
who
seek
personal
gain
at
the
expense
of
others
quickly
find
themselves
ostracized…
or
worse.
Life
in
Demacia
is
not
one
of
placid
utopian
dreams.
Since
the
Demacian
people
pride
themselves
as
the
moral
vanguards
of
Valoran,
they
adopt
seemingly
draconian
measures
to
ensure
that
their
moral
code
remains
the
only
code
by
which
one
may
live
within
the
city-state.
Crime
in
any
form
is
harshly
punished:
there
are
no
misdemeanors
within
Demacia.
Some
detractors
of
Demacia
(who
criticize
far
from
the
reaches
of
the
city-state)
claim
this
as
proof
of
its
inherent
hypocrisy.
Demacians
counter
this
argument
by
pointing
out
that
their
justice
system
incorporates
benevolence
and
mitigation
into
its
verdicts.
No
one
is
punished
without
fair
and
just
consideration
of
the
circumstances
involved.
While
others
may
continue
to
criticize
the
harshness
of
Demacian
law,
the
Demacians
stand
by
their
convictions.
Demacian
crest
Government
Demacia
is
run
by
a
constitutional
monarchy,
wherein
the
King
of
Demacia
serves
as
the
head
of
state
and
an
elected
council
serves
as
the
legislative
body.
While
the
king
is
a
strong
ruler,
he
is
kept
in
check
at
least
partially
by
the
Demacian
Council.
The
current
King
of
Demacia,
Jarvan
III
(a.k.a.
Jarvan
Lightshield
the
Third),
works
earnestly
with
the
Demacian
Council
to
ensure
that
the
sanctity
of
the
city-state
remains
pure
and
true.
Since
the
rule
of
Jarvan
I,
there
has
never
been
an
attempted
coup
or
rebellion
of
any
kind
in
Demacia.
The
king
serves
not
only
as
the
political
leader
of
the
city-state,
but
also
as
the
commander-in-chief
of
its
military.
Noble
Houses
As
a
monarchy,
Demacia
is
governed
by
various
royal
families,
regulating
the
city-state
primarily
as
members
of
the
Demacian
Council.
While
many
of
the
Noble
Houses
have
ruled
for
generations,
they
are
treated
as
any
other
citizen
under
the
nation’s
strict
laws
and
are
not
exempt
from
them.
They
may
even
be
treated
more
harshly
under
the
law
as
they
are
meant
to
serve
as
shining
examples
of
how
Demacian
citizens
should
conduct
themselves,
publicly
and
privately.

Laurent
Military
Garen
,
a
soldier
of
the
Demacian
military
The
Demacian
military
is
one
of
the
strongest
in
all
of
Valoran,
and
until
recently
it
was
the
only
force
capable
of
holding
back
the
hunger
of
the
military
machine
that
is
Noxus
.
Noxus
has
been
the
sworn
enemy
of
Demacia
since
both
settlements
were
founded
hundreds
of
years
ago.
Their
conflict
is,
at
its
core,
a
moral
one.
With
such
a
night-and-day
division
of
moral
philosophy
between
Demacia
and
Noxus,
it
is
not
hard
to
see
why
Demacia
views
its
military
requirements
as
a
vital
necessity
for
survival.
Every
Demacian
citizen
is
required
to
serve
in
its
military
for
no
less
than
three
years.
Even
after
this
time,
most
Demacians
remain
on
active
status
in
the
city-state’s
military
reserve.
The
resolve
of
Demacia's
military
is
alternately
celebrated
or
despised,
but
always
respected.
Their
"zero
tolerance"
moral
code
is
strictly
upheld
by
civilians
and
soldiers
alike.
In
combat,
this
means
Demacian
troops
may
not
make
excuses,
flee,
or
surrender
by
example.
Thousands
of
great
heroes
have
risen
and
fallen
on
the
bloody
battlefields
between
Demacia
and
its
preeminent
rival,
Noxus.
As
an
indoctrination
tool,
the
Demacian
military
utilizes
The
Measured
Tread
,
a
handbook
which
outlines
the
city-state's
ideology.
Quotes
from
the
book
include:
"Death
is
inevitable;
one
can
only
avoid
defeat."
"To
fight
for
justice
in
the
name
of
Demacia."
"Victory
for
our
allies,
defeat
for
our
enemies,
and
justice
for
all."
"When
Demacians
march
forth,
ridding
Valoran
of
the
evils
of
selfishness
and
greed
under
the
pristine
banner
of
justice,
we
know
who
we
are
and
what
we
fight
for,
unapologetically."
"In
our
eternal
forward
march,
we
must
stomp
out
evil
all
across
Valoran
wherever
it
may
grow.
Leave
no
stone
unturned:
the
roots
of
one
ignored
weed
will
inevitably
corrupt
the
whole
of
the
garden.”
Appearance
Demacia
is
a
shining
beacon
of
hope
for
humanity,
and
as
such
the
city
is
the
visual
representation
of
this
concept.
There
is
a
clean
and
pristine
feel
and
look
to
the
city.
Towering
spires
litter
the
skyline
of
Demacia.
White
stone
and
marble
are
the
materials
of
choice
in
the
construction
of
Demacian
buildings.
Majestic
flags
fly
high
along
the
parapets
of
the
city.
The
city
walls
virtually
gleam
with
power
and
nobility.
The
capital
itself
sits
next
to
a
natural
port,
with
the
majority
of
the
other
towns
resting
on
a
plateau.
Link
to
the
League
Demacia
was
one
of
the
first
supporters
of
the
League
of
Legends
,
though
its
concerns
were
less
for
the
planet’s
stability
and
more
for
diminishing
the
Noxian
threat
to
Valoran.
Demacia
sent
its
best
students
of
magic
to
the
Institute
of
War,
with
some
of
them
becoming
master
summoners.
Demacia
holds
its
own
in
the
Field
of
Justice
,
and
this
has
subsequently
eased
the
massive
expenditure
of
resources
otherwise
needed
to
maintain
its
military
force.
The
post-League
Demacian
military
is
as
strong
as
ever,
though
it
has
shifted
its
focus
from
that
of
a
standing
invasion
force,
ready
to
re-conquest
Noxian
acquisitions,
to
that
of
an
impenetrable
bastion,
secure
and
vigilant
across
its
entire
dominion.
History
Captain
Lionel
Brickhouse
accepting
command
of
the
DSS
Excursion
Piracy
Strikes
Demacian
Navy
The
DSS
Excursion
-
a
cargo
sloop
of
the
Demacian
Navy
-
was
reported
lost
at
sea,
an
apparent
victim
of
piracy.
All
hands
aboard
are
currently
missing,
and
no
demands
were
made
of
the
Demacian
government
for
their
return.
The
Excursion
was
bound
from
Freljord
to
Demacia
laden
with
unspecified
trade
goods,
according
to
a
spokesperson
for
the
Demacian
Navy,
when
audiopathic
contact
with
the
sloop
was
ultimately
lost.
After
twenty-four
hours
of
communications
silence,
rescue
vessels
were
dispatched
to
the
Excursion's
last
reported
location.
The
Demacian
investigation
of
the
ship's
disappearance
-
led
by
Demacian
Captain
of
the
Guard
and
Champion
of
the
League,
Garen
-
reported
that
some
of
the
logged
cargo
of
the
Excursion
had
been
jettisoned
into
the
Conqueror's
Sea
approximately
twenty
kilometers
from
the
vessel's
last
reported
position.
Other
debris
located
near
the
jettisoned
cargo
was
divined
for
analysis,
revealing
that
the
Excursion
had
been
attacked
and
boarded
while
en
route
to
Demacia.
Further
divination
did
not
reveal
the
identity
of
the
perpetrators
of
the
attack,
though
it
was
gleaned
that
the
attack
occurred
at
night
when
most
of
the
Excursion's
crew
was
in
their
quarters.
The
investigation
has
further
revealed
that
magic
above
maximum
potency
as
dictated
by
the
League
was
used
in
the
attack,
and
necromancy
is
believed
to
have
been
used
based
on
the
evidence
divined.
As
a
result,
the
League
dispatched
a
team
of
investigators
led
by
League
Champion
Kayle,
the
Judicator
.
The
whereabouts
of
the
DSS
Excursion
remains
a
mystery
to
this
day.
Sivir's
Vacation
Sure
she's
deadly.
She
wouldn't
still
have
the
title
“the
Battle
Mistress”
if
she
wasn't.
Sure
she's
survived
multiple
attempts
on
her
life
at
the
behest
of
the
Noxian
High
Command.
Sure
she's
hotter
than
a
summer
day
–
that
red
and
gold
outfit
certainly
provides
her
with
plenty
of
space
to
move.
Nevertheless,
our
lady
Sivir
may
have
come
up
against
a
force
she
won't
be
able
to
overcome!
For
those
whose
memory
is
less
than
stellar,
Sivir
was
arrested
last
October
after
going
for
an
alcohol-induced
joyride
in
a
hex-tech
conveyance,
terrorizing
her
two
passengers
and
a
host
of
pedestrians.
She
was
arrested
by
Demacian
authorities
shortly
afterwards,
if
you
remember
the
hype,
and
she
stood
trial
just
the
other
day.
Judge
Haley
Suede
took
pity
on
Sivir's
"I'm
just
a
lonely
girl
with
personal
problems"
defense
and
sentenced
the
Champion
to
90
days
in
a
Demacian
penitentiary,
with
time
spent
in
the
Fields
of
Justice
not
counting
towards
her
sentence.
Listen,
I
love
our
Champions
–
they
pay
my
bills
–
but
one
thing
I
can't
stand
is
the
way
they're
given
special
dispensation
by
the
courts.
If
I'd
done
the
same
thing,
I
would
be
in
jail
for
the
next
18
months,
and
not
in
a
cushy
part
of
the
prison.
Oh
well.
Position
has
its
privilege,
but
we'll
have
to
see
how
a
jail
term
interferes
with
her
duties
to
the
League
of
Legends.
More
on
this
as
it
develops.
Demacian
Miners,
Trapped
in
Kalamanda
Rescue
parties
rush
to
save
the
trapped
Demacian
miners
in
Kalamanda.
An
earthquake
rocked
the
village
of
Kalamanda
yesterday
evening,
causing
the
collapse
of
a
mithril
mine
and
trapping
twelve
Demacian
miners
underground.
Rescue
efforts
began
shortly
after
the
mine
caved
in,
though
no
announcement
of
progress
has
been
made
by
the
village.
No
other
damage
in
Kalamanda
was
reported.
The
collapse
occurred
during
the
early
morning
work
shift
at
the
#1
Loadstone
Mining
Consortium
(LMC)
mine,
which
is
the
site
of
Demacia’s
primary
mineral
extraction
operation
in
Kalamanda.
Reports
from
miners
who
narrowly
avoided
the
accident
indicate
that
there
was
initially
a
low
rumble
that
rapidly
grew
louder
emanating
from
deep
within
the
mine.
Shortly
after
the
rumbling
started,
the
main
mine
shaft
began
to
shake,
and
it
eventually
collapsed.
The
fates
of
the
twelve
miners
still
trapped
underground
remain
unknown.
The
tremor
also
released
huge
pockets
of
magical
energy
into
the
atmosphere,
prompting
immediate
concern
that
the
area
is
rapidly
becoming
unstable.
League
officials
descended
upon
Kalamanda
en
masse,
studying
the
causes
and
effects
of
the
catastrophe.
Finger
pointing
began
immediately
across
Valoran
;
rumors
that
the
quake
was
caused
by
the
rampant
influx
of
unregulated
mining
operations
and
environmentally
unsafe
mining
practices
by
Zaun
have
been
raised,
along
with
wilder
accusations
that
the
quake
was
deliberately
triggered.
The
Loadstone
Mining
Consortium
is
a
mining
company
owned
in
part
by
the
Demacian
royal
family.
It
had
just
conducted
safety
inspections
of
all
its
facilities
in
Kalamanda
before
yesterday’s
events.
“There
is
no
reason
whatsoever
that
the
#1
mine
should
have
collapsed
at
all,”
commented
Winston
Garnersham,
chief
overseer
of
the
LMC’s
Kalamanda
operations.
“Although
the
earthquake
was
unpredictable,
the
magnitude
of
the
shock
was
not
great
enough
to
cause
a
collapse.
That
mine
checked
out
across
the
board;
were
it
even
remotely
unsafe,
we
would
have
shut
it
down.
We
are
not
in
the
business
of
risking
the
lives
of
our
employees
for
profit.”
The
League
has
offered
assistance
to
Demacia
in
its
rescue
efforts,
as
have
the
small
contingencies
of
Piltover
and
Ionia
.
Help
has
even
been
offered
by
the
Noxian
delegation
in
Kalamanda
–
a
surprising
move
considering
the
animosity
between
Demacia
and
Noxus
in
recent
years.
Katarina
,
champion
of
the
League
and
the
Noxian
High
Command’s
representative
in
Kalamanda,
issued
the
following
statement
in
light
of
the
accident:
“Our
well-wishes
go
out
to
the
miners
who
are
currently
fighting
for
their
lives
in
the
collapsed
Loadstone
mine.
Such
business
is
dangerous,
especially
when
companies
may
be
tempted
to
risk
the
lives
of
others
in
unsafe
working
environments.
In
the
future,
Noxus
would
be
willing
to
share
the
expert
safety
practices
of
Noxian
mining
operations
with
the
other
city-states
working
in
Kalamanda.”
The
vast
mineral
wealth
uncovered
last
year
in
Kalamanda
has
been
steadily
exploited
by
city-states
and
independent
miners
alike.
Demacia
and
Noxus
are
the
two
city-states
with
the
largest
presence
in
Kalamanda,
with
both
setting
up
military
outposts
near
the
village.
The
village’s
elders
have
stated
in
no
uncertain
terms
that
they
are
looking
to
establish
an
exclusive
contract
with
a
single
city-state
for
future
mineral
exploitation,
though
no
final
decision
has
been
made
in
that
regard.
Both
Demacia
and
Noxus
are
thought
to
be
the
leading
contenders
for
securing
exclusive
mining
rights
in
Kalamanda.
Trivia
The
city-state
motto
for
Demacians
is,
"Demacia:
now
and
forever."
A
common
battle
cry
among
Demacian
champions
is,
"Demacia!"
