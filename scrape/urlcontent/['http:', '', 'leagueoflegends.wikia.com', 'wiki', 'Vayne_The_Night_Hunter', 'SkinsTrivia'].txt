Trivia
Vayne's
first
name
is
Shauna.
Like
many
other
hunters
of
the
supernatural,
Vayne's
character
concept
is
inspired
by
Abraham
van
Helsing
,
the
protagonist
from
Bram
Stoker's
1897
novel,
Dracula
.
Vayne's
name
and
past
are
possible
references
to
DC
Comics
character
Bruce
Wayne,
the
Batman
.
Vayne
may
also
be
a
reference
to
the
DC
Comics
character
Huntress
,
due
to
the
the
similarities
between
their
weapons
and
pasts.
Vayne
bears
some
resemblance
to
the
main
character
from
the
game
Bayonetta
.
Vayne's
Silver
Bolts
,
is
a
reference
to
the
belief
that
supernatural
creatures,
particularly
werewolves
,
are
vulnerable
to
weapons
made
from
silver.
Vayne
is
the
only
champion
to
currently
have
a
defense
rating
of
1.
Vayne's
dance
is
inspired
by
the
Gun
Kata
.
A
side-by-side
comparison
can
be
seen
here
.
Vayne
is
the
first
champion
who
shares
her
title
with
a
skill
name
,
followed
by
Zyra
.
Quotes
Vayne
is
the
first
champion
to
always
have
a
quote
play
out
when
learning
a
skill.
Vayne's
quote
"On
wings
of
night."
is
similar
to
Shyvana's
quote
"On
wings
of
fury."
Vayne's
quote
when
using
her
ultimate,
"The
die
is
cast"
is
a
reference
to
Julius'
Caesar
phrase
"Alea
Iacta
Est"
.

Skins
In
the
background
of
Classic
Vayne's
splash
art,
there
is
a
tombstone
labeled
"URF"
in
reference
to
Urf,
the
Manatee
,
and
Yorick's
shovel.
Vindicator
Vayne
is
likely
a
reference
to
the
Death
Dealers
from
the
Underworld
film
series.
Vayne
in
her
Aristocrat
skin
is
wearing
Steampunk-styled
clothing.
Heartseeker
Vayne
is
a
tribute
to
Valentine's
Day.
In
her
Heartseeker
skin,
Dr.
Mundo
is
shown
shot
down
in
the
background
with
a
bouquet
of
roses,
and
Vayne
herself
is
reading
a
macaroni
card
made
by
him.
In
its
Chinese
artwork,
Jack
of
Hearts
Twisted
Fate
can
be
seen
in
the
background.
Relations
There
is
speculation
that
Vayne
is
secretly
investigating
the
activities
of
LeBlanc
and
the
Black
Rose
organization.
