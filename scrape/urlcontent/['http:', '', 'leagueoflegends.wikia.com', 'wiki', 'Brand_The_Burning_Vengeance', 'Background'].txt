In
a
faraway
place
known
as
Lokfar
there
was
a
seafaring
marauder
called
Kegan
Rodhe.
As
was
his
people’s
way,
Kegan
sailed
far
and
wide
with
his
fellows,
stealing
treasures
from
those
unlucky
enough
to
catch
their
attention.
To
some,
he
was
a
monster;
to
others,
just
a
man.
One
night,
as
they
sailed
through
the
arctic
waters,
strange
lights
danced
over
the
frozen
wastes.
There
was
something
hypnotic
about
them;
it
was
something
that
drew
them
to
it
like
moths
to
a
flame.
Trekking
across
the
frozen
waste,
they
came
to
a
cave
covered
in
ancient
runes.
Though
the
meaning
of
the
runes
was
long
lost
to
them,
Kegan
led
the
way
inside.
Inside
a
perfect
cage
of
ice
floated
a
dancing
column
of
flame.
There
was
no
way
such
a
thing
should
be
burning,
especially
not
in
this
place.
However,
its
movement
was
as
hypnotic
as
a
siren's
song,
captivating
and
seductive.
While
the
others
stayed
back,
Kegan
could
not
help
but
approach
it
while
holding
out
his
hand...
That
is
the
last
thing
Kegan
Rodhe
remembers,
for
now
his
body
belongs
to
Brand.
It
is
a
creature
of
olden
times—perhaps
even
a
casualty
of
the
Rune
Wars.
It
is
known
in
ancient
texts
as
the
Burning
Vengeance.
It
is
a
creature
of
pure
fiery
hate
that
exists
for
no
other
reason
than
to
lay
waste
the
world
of
men
and
yordles
.
No
one
is
quite
sure
how
Brand
found
his
way
to
Valoran
,
but
he
began
his
predations
at
once.
Overcome
by
Demacian
forces,
he
was
given
a
choice:
fight
within
the
confines
of
the
League
or
die.
Naturally,
he
chose
to
use
his
destructive
powers
in
the
League,
for
now...
"This
place
will
burn,
not
by
cinder
flying
on
breath
of
wind,
but
by
the
vengeance
of
my
hand."

CLE
OBSERVATION
The
forest
burns,
blazing
with
the
light
of
the
sun.
A
lone
figure
stands
amidst
the
conflagration,
reveling
in
the
blistering
heat.
It
has
been
so
long
since
he
burned,
so
long
since
he
watched
the
world
fall
to
ashes
under
his
power.
It
is
ecstasy.
He
emerges
from
the
flames.
He
can
sense
that
nearby,
over
the
next
hill,
there
is
life.
People
scramble,
seeing
the
smoke
from
his
inferno.
Soon,
they
too
will
receive
his
gift
of
renewal.
"Stop,
in
the
name
of
the
Kingdom
of
Demacia!"
He
turns.
He
is
approached
by
a
tall
man
in
armor.
The
knight
levels
his
sword,
ready
to
strike
if
needs
be.
This
man
will
soon
discover
that
needs
be.
The
man
is
followed
by
a
blonde
girl.
Her
armor
has
similarities
to
the
man's.
He
can
tell
by
her
rod
that
she
is
a
magician
of
some
sort.
He
decides
that
she
will
have
to
be
first.
Then,
another
presence
steps
from
the
shadows.
This
one
wears
a
cloak,
its
face
buried
deep
within
the
hood.
The
stitching
is
alien
to
him,
but
he
can
recognize
its
arcane
nature.
He
decides
the
girl
will
have
to
wait.
He
turns
and
unleashes
a
jet
of
burning
vengeance
at
the
hooded
figure.
Hands
shoot
up
from
inside
the
cloak,
held
in
magical
gestures.
A
shimmering
shield
blocks
the
flames,
directing
them
harmlessly
upward.
"This
is
my
last
warning.
Come
peacefully,
or
face
punishment!"
He
decides
that
the
noises
coming
from
the
armored
man's
mouth
do
not
contain
enough
searing
agony.
He
turns
and
calls
a
pillar
of
flame
to
immolate
the
man.
Again,
a
magical
shield
thwarts
his
efforts.
Then,
darkness...
REFLECTION
He
awakened.
He
lay
in
a
pool
of
harsh
light,
descending
from
above.
The
floor
was
smooth,
but
he
couldn't
tell
if
this
was
a
room
or
some
magical
trap.
At
this,
his
mind
vaulted
through
his
memories,
to
a
very
painful
moment
in
the
past.
They
had
somehow
devised
a
way
to
shackle
him.
Kneeling
here
on
the
snowy
cave
floor,
the
long-haired
barbarians
around
him
chanted
words
he
barely
understood.
However,
the
icy
cage
ritualistically
placed
in
the
center
of
the
cave
told
him
everything
he
needed
to
know
about
his
fate.
He
strained
against
the
mystical
chains
that
bound
him,
but
to
no
avail.
He
shouted,
screamed,
and
bellowed,
trying
to
disrupt
the
concentration
of
his
captors,
but
also
to
no
avail.
He
could
only
wait
as
they
ripped
him
from
his
mortal
shell
and
trapped
him
inside
the
cage.
Then,
without
words,
the
barbarians
took
their
things
and
left.
He
was
alone,
and
would
remain
so
for
more
than
a
thousand
years.
He
screamed
in
rage.
His
mind
hurtled
back
to
the
present,
once
again
encompassed
by
light.
"So.
You
can
be
contained
more
permanently."
He
turned,
immediately
reaching
out
to
burn
the
owner
of
the
voice.
However,
his
flames
fizzled
to
nothing
at
the
edge
of
the
circle
of
light.
He
tried
to
leap
toward
the
voice,
but
a
force
blocked
him.
Knocked
back
to
the
floor,
he
peered
to
see
if
his
eyes
could
penetrate
the
darkness.
"That
ritual
is
long-lost,
sorcerer.
Your
power
cannot
hold
me
forever."
A
figure
stepped
out
from
the
darkness,
the
hooded
magician
from
the
forest.
"We
both
know
that
isn't
true."
Again,
his
mind
became
dislodged
from
the
moment,
traveling
back
to
a
time
before
the
ice
barbarians
imprisoned
him.
The
body
he
wore
was
different,
one
of
the
simple
herding
folk
of
these
farming
lands.
However,
he
still
burned.
The
scene
before
him
would
have
looked
like
the
apocalypse
to
any
mortal
observer.
To
him,
it
was
an
image
of
absolute
beauty.
The
countryside
had
been
reduced
to
blackened
ash.
The
nearby
wooded
hills
were
now
nothing
more
than
incinerated
stumps
and
trunks.
The
charred
bones
of
farmers
and
animals
dotted
the
landscape,
accompanied
by
the
armored
remains
of
the
warriors
who
had
futilely
hoped
to
stop
his
renewal.
The
feeling
that
welled
inside
him
could
only
be
called
one
of
profound
satisfaction.
Again,
the
present,
the
light.
"You
are
a
creature
of
destruction."
Knowing
that
violence
was
no
longer
an
option,
he
sat
cross-legged
in
the
pool
of
light
and
willed
the
flames
that
played
across
his
body
to
burn
even
more
brightly.
"I
am
a
creature
of
ever-lasting
fire.
I
am
a
creature
who
burns
away
what
needs
to
make
way
for
what
will
be.
I
am
a
creature
born
to
renew
the
world."
The
sorcerer
began
to
walk,
circling
his
cage.
"You
and
I
will
have
much
time
to
talk
in
the
days
and
weeks
to
come,
so
for
the
moment
I
will
focus
on
the
now.
We
cannot
allow
you
to
roam
free.
You
are
clearly
far
too
dangerous
for
that.
So,
I
offer
you
a
choice."
Weary
of
the
sorcerer's
voice
behind
him,
he
stood
to
track
the
pacing
figure.
The
sorcerer
continued.
"You
have
two
options.
You
may
choose
to
be
stripped
from
the
body
you
wear
and
imprisoned
indefinitely.
Or,
you
may
choose
to
remain
under
our
control
and
fight
in
competitions
where
your
abilities
will
be
of
use.
That
is
the
closest
thing
to
freedom
you
will
be
afforded.
These
terms
are
not
negotiable."
Neither
option
was
palatable
to
him.
"These
competitions,
sorcerer.
What
are
they?"
"You
would
fight
in
the
League
of
Legends,
battling
champions
to
settle
our
conflicts
in
place
of
open
warfare."
He
mused
for
a
moment,
before
sitting
on
the
floor
again.
"I
must
think
on
your
offer,
sorcerer."
The
hooded
man
faded
back
into
the
shadows.
"I
am
no
sorcerer.
You
will
address
me
by
my
proper
title.
Summoner.
How
shall
I
address
you?"
"I
am
known
by
many
names,"
he
replied.
"But
in
this
time,
in
your
League
of
Legends,
I
believe
Brand
is
fitting."
And
then,
he
was
alone,
given
space
to
think.
However,
there
was
no
thinking
to
be
done.
A
leash
was
far
better
than
an
eternity
caged.
