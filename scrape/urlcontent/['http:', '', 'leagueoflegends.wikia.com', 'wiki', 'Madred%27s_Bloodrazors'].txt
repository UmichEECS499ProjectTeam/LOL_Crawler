Bloodrazor
Notes
It
was
best
used
on
DPS
(damage
per
second)
champions
when
the
other
team
had
a
lot
of
tanks
with
armor
or
health
builds.
DPS
champions
could
maximize
the
effect
of
this
item
by
stacking
it
with
attack
speed
items
and
other
on
hit
items
such
as
Malady
,
Ionic
Spark
and
Wit's
End
.
The
unique
passive
of
Madred's
Bloodrazor
dealt
magic
damage.
Therefore,
the
unique
effect
could
have
its
damage
reduced
by
magic
resistance
items
such
as
Negatron
Cloak
.
Malady
synergized
with
Madred's
Bloodrazor
since
it
reduced
the
magic
resistance
of
your
target
with
each
hit.
Champions
who
can
proc
on
hit
effects
multiple
times
in
quick
succession
did
best
with
this
item,
such
as
Warwick's
Infinite
Duress
and
Renekton's
Ruthless
Predator
,
which
could
result
in
the
quick
destruction
of
health
stacking
champions
or
tanks
that
lack
magic
resistance.
Madred's
Bloodrazor
Dominion
counterpart
is
Kitae's
Bloodrazor
.
The
item
was
removed
because
it
gave
too
many
odd
stats,
and
its
on-hit
damage
was
magic
damage
which
made
it
hard
to
put
in
an
effective
item
build
that
would
still
synergize
with
the
auto
attacking
champions
that
would
build
it
(Warwick
being
one
of
the
few
excepetions).
It
was
replaced
with
Blade
of
the
Ruined
King
.
