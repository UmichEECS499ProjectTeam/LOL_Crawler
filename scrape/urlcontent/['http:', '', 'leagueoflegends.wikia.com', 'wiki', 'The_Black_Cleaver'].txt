Notes
The
armor

passive
triggers
not
only
on
autoattacks
but
on
any
effect
that
deals
physical
damage,
such
as
Urgot's
Acid
Hunter
,
Garen's
Judgment
,
and
Pantheon's
Heartseeker
Strike
.
On-hit
effects
do
not
apply
an
additional
armor
shred
stack.
Auto-attacks
with
Tiamat
and
Ravenous
Hydra
will
apply
stacks
to
nearby
champions,
but
a
champion
attacked
directly
can't
receive
additional
stacks.
The
armor
reduction
stacks
from
The
Black
Cleaver
apply
only
to
enemy
champions.
They
will
not
affect
structures
such
as
turrets
and
inhibitors
,
minions
,
or
neutral
monsters
.
Physical
damage-over-time
abilities
will
apply
one
stack
on
every
tick.
Pets
that
deal
physical
damage
will
apply
stacks,
even
if
they
don't
apply
on-hit
effects
or
spell
effects.
The
very
first
instance
of
physical
damage
does
not
get
the
benefit
of
the
armor
reduction.
The
physical
damage
dealt
is
calculated
first,
and
the
debuff
is
applied
after.
This
means
the
full
benefit
of
the
reduction
is
seen
on
the
sixth
hit,
after
all
five
stacks
have
been
applied.
Last
Whisper
provides
more
raw
percent-based
armor
piercing
than
the
full
five
Black
Cleaver
stacks
(35%
to
25%,
respectively),
but
The

an
entire
team,
while
Last
Whisper's
only
augments
its
wielder's
damage.

allowing
an

character
to
benefit
simultaneously
from
Black

,
and
champion
abilities
that
circumvent
