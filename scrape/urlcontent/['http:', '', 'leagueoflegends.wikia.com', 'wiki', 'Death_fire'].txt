Notes
The
activated
damage
triggers
on-ability
effects
,
such
as
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
and
spell
vamp
,
and
is
treated
as
a
single-target
spell
for
the
purpose
of
these
effects.
It
does
not
apply
champion-specific
effects
(such
as
Brand's
Blaze
).
The
Doom
debuff
can
be
removed
with
Quicksilver
.
Strategy
It
is
best
used
to
initiate
fights,
as
it
amplifies
all
subsequent
magic
damage
the
target
takes.
It
is
worth
stressing
that
that
the
damage
amplifier
will
increase
magic
damage
dealt
from
all
sources,
not
just
the
holder
of
Deathfire
Grasp.
Deathfire
Grasp
is
a
great
choice
on
burst
mages
who
have
the
potential
to
kill
enemies
in
a
single
spell
combo,
such
as
Veigar
and
LeBlanc
.
Deathfire
Grasp
is
a
better
option
when
more
than
one
member
of
a
team
deals
primarily
magic
damage,
such
as
an
AP
support.
Trivia
When
Deathfire
Grasp
was
originally
added,
it
was
far
too
powerful
on
certain
champions
and
was
removed
and
reworked
into
its
current
iteration.
Its
previous
behavior
has
now
been
reinstated
and
slightly
modified
into
Liandry's
Torment
.
In
the
V1.0.0.61
patch,
the
item
was
reimplemented
with
a
new
functionality.
Deathfire
Grasp
,
Randuin's
Omen
,
Shurelya's
Reverie
,
and
Youmuu's
Ghostblade
were
released
as
a
quartet
of
"sister
items"
that
share
similar
features,
specifically
having
an
active
ability
and
a
gold-generating
item
in
their
recipe.
[2]
Abilities
that
cause
you
to
deal
increased
damage
also
increase
the
damage
dealt
by
Deathfire
Grasp
(e.g.
Vladimir's
Hemoplague
,
Poppy's
Diplomatic
Immunity
,
and
Swain's
Torment
).
Also,
Deathfire's
debuff
"Doom"
stacks
additively
with
other
sources
of
percentile
received
damage
amplification
(for
example,
Vladimir's
Hemoplague
)
However
it
stacks
multiplicatively
with
all
sources
of
percentile
dealt
damage
amplification
(for
example,
Poppy's
Diplomatic
Immunity
,
and
Swain's
Torment
),
as
long
as
the
incoming
damage
is
magical.
