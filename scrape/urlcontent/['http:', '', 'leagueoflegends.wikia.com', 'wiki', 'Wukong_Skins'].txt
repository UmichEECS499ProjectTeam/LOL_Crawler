Trivia
The
name
"Wukong"
means
"awakening
to
emptiness"
or
"perceiving
air"
(悟空)
in
Chinese.
Due
to
this,
Wukong
in
Japanese
can
be
said
as
"Gokuu",
due
to
a
more
popular
romanization
of
the
name
in
most
anime/manga
adaptations.
Wukong
is
voiced
by
Spike
Spencer
.
Wukong's
character
concept
is
inspired
by
and
directly
based
off
of
Sun
Wukong
,
the
protagonist
of
the
Chinese
novel
Journey
to
the
West
.
Wukong
is
also
one
of
the
few
champions
to
be
based
on
a
public
domain
character
of
mythology
in
general.
(Sun
Wukong
is
also
romanized
as
"Son
Gokuu"
in
Japanese.)
Both
characters
have
the
title
of
"The
Monkey
King,"
use
the
same
type
of
weapon
(an
elongating
staff),
and
ride
on
a
type
of
nimbus
cloud.
Wukong
is
one
of
the
few
champions
to
be
specifically
based
on
a
character
from
real-world
literature.
Another
reference
is
that
Wukong
also
likes
peaches.
Wukong's
abilities,
Nimbus
Strike
and
Decoy
are
references
to
Sun
Wukong's
ability
to
ride
on
clouds
via
his
"Somersault
Cloud"
(筋斗雲,
Jīndǒuyún/Kinto'un
)
technique
and
to
create
clones
of
himself
using
strands
of
his
hair,
respectively.
Both
abilities
were
taught
to
him
by
Wukong's
previous
master
(who
also
gave
him
his
name).
The
fact
that
Wukong
was
trained
under
Master
Yi
is
also
another
possible
reference
to
Sun
Wukong's
original
master
often
refered
to
as
Master
Bohdi,
or
Wukong's
more
famous
master
during
his
pilgrimage
to
the
West,
Xuanzang
Sanzang
(Genjou
Sanzou
in
Japanese).
Wukong's
passive,
Stone
Skin
,
is
possibly
a
reference
to
Sun
Wukong
being
born
from
a
stone
and
also
said
to
be
born
from
the
earth
itself.
This
is
supported
by
the
fact
that
Wukong
turns
to
stone
when
he
dies.
Wukong
is
the
first
champion
to
have
an
animated
Gameplay
Preview
.
The
internal
name,
the
name
that
is
used
by
the
game
developers
themselves,
for
Wukong's
ultimate
Cyclone
is
"MonkeyKingSpinToWin",
a
reference
to
the
popular
community
description
for
Garen's
Judgment
.
Coincidentally,
much
of
Garen's
kit
is
a
possible
basis
for
Wukong
,
mainly
due
to
both
characters
having:
A
"Q"
ability
that
scales
over
100%
in
attack
damage
as
an
attack
booster
with
an
extra
effect
(
Decisive
Strike
silences
with
a
movement
speed
boost
while
Wukong's
Crushing
Blow
reduces
armor
by
30%).
A
passive
ability
that
increases
their
defensive
stats
(with
Garen's
being
a
normal
ability
with
not
only
percentage
defensive
boosts,
but
also
with
a
damage
reduction
active
while
Wukong's
only
being
a
standard
passive
with
flat
defense
boosts.)
Point-and-click
spells;
Garen's
can
only
target
one
champion
with
it
and
acts
as
his
ult;
Wukong's
can
hit
two
extra
targets
in
range,
moves
him
to
said
target(s)
and
acts
as
a
normal
ability
instead.
Wukong's
Cyclone
and
Judgment
involve
a
very
similar
spinning
animation
and
the
way
their
hits
are
racked
up
and
how
they
can
involve
bonus
movement
speed
during
cast
time
and
cancellation.
A
number
of
certain
item
actives
and
summoner
spells
can
even
be
used
during
their
cast
times.
Wukong's
Cyclone
now
holds
the
record
for
the
highest
AD
Ratio
in
the
game,
achieving
a
4.8
AD
Ratio
under
a
full
duration
of
the
spell.
The
name
of
the
spell
from
the
Chinese
Servers,
大鬧天宮
in
Traditional
Chinese
or
大闹天宫
Simplified
Chinese
(
Dànào
Tiāngōng
,
lit.
Havoc
in
Heaven
)
references
the
prequel
tale
of
the
Journey
to
the
West
legend,
which
explains
Wukong's
birth,
claim
to
power
at
his
home
turf,
his
powers'
origins,
and
his
deeds
with
divine
beings
which
lead
him
to
a
war
against
heaven,
causing
him
through
Buddha's
power
to
be
sealed
under
Five
Finger
Mountain
(Wǔzhǐshān/Goshizan,
五指山)
for
five
centuries.
[1]
During
the
animation
of
Wukong's
joke,
he
elongates
his
staff
very
much.
This
is
how
the
staff,
known
as
the
Ruyi
Jingu
Bang/Nyoi
Kinko
Bou
(如意金箍棒,
lit.
Compliant
Gold-Rimmed
Staff)
actually
functions
in
the
original
novel
for
reaching
or
attacking
his
target
afar,
as
well
as
also
changing
in
nearly
all
forms
of
general
size.
Wukong
himself
even
gloats
that
he
can
attack
the
enemy
base
from
such
a
position
(though
due
to
obvious
gameplay
reasons,
this
actual
feat
cannot
be
done
in
such
a
way).
Said
staff
was
known
for
weighing
13,500
jin,
which
was
around
8,100
kg
or
17,800
lbs.
It
was
also
made
of
"crow
iron",
a
rare
form
of
black
iron.
The
staff
however,
does
extend
during
his
Crushing
Blow
and
Cyclone
abilities.
League
of
Legends
,
along
with
Heroes
of
Newerth
and
Smite
are
three
of
the
current
MOBA's
to
feature
a
character
based
off
of
Sun
Wukong.
All
three
of
them
(including
Smite's
pre-worked
Sun
Wukong)
have
very
similar
abilities
and
playstyles
(mainly
being
damaging
tanks
with
assassin
potential,
and
having
very
unique
tricks
with
their
abilities).
Skins
Classic
Wukong's
Chinese
splash
art's
water
dragon
(also
in
the
Jade
Dragon
arts)
may
be
a
reference
to
the
Dragon
who
swallowed
Xuanzang
's
mount
in
the
Journey
to
the
West
,
causing
Wukong
to
fight
against
it.
Volcanic
Wukong
may
be
a
reference
to
Journey
to
the
West's
aforementioned
prequel
story
,
when
Sun
Wukong
was
locked
in
a
cauldron
by
the
Taoist
Lao
Tzu
(on
behalf
of
the
Jade
Emperor
to
assist
in
executing
him
as
no
options
were
left)
to
be
distilled
by
severe,
sacred
fires
for
40-50
days
straight
and
turned
into
an
elixir.
But
when
Lao
Tzu
opened
the
lid,
Wukong
was
alive
and
stronger
than
ever
with
the
ability
the
Jīnjīnghuǒyǎn/Kinshou
Higan
(金睛火眼,
lit.
Gold
Gazing
Fire
Eyes)
which
enabled
him
to
see
evil
(but
gave
him
a
weakness
to
smoke).
However,
it
is
unknown
if
Wukong
himself
is
as
immortal
as
the
original
Sun
Wukong
(as
the
latter's
case
involved
immortality
peaches,
longevity
pills
and
the
Jade
Emperor's
royal
wine
all
consumed
in
a
combo),
but
seems
to
have
some
form
of
resistance
comparable
to
the
original
in
current
times.
The
skin
may
also
be
a
reference
to
a
character/Pokemon
from
the
Pokemon
series,
Infernape
(known
as
Goukazaru
in
Japanese),
who
was
also
said
to
be
based
on
Sun
Wukong
as
well.
Likewise,
the
Pokemon
Emboar
(Enbuou
in
Japanese),
is
said
to
be
based
on
one
of
Wukong's
original
companions,
Zhu
Bajie/Cho
Hakkai
(豬八戒,
lit.
Pig
of
Eight
Commandments).
It
also
bears
a
possible
nod
to
the
Rajang
of
the
Monster
Hunter
series,
as
not
only
does
the
Rajang
bear
reference
to
the
Saiyans
of
Dragon
Ball
lore
(one
character
of
that
species
also
being
based
off
of
Sun
Wukong
in
a
more
popular
fashion),
the
more
stronger
variations
of
the
species
tend
to
reside
at
volcanic
areas.
Jade
Dragon
Wukong
wears
Chinese
jade
,
which
is
commonly
carved
in
the
form
of
a
dragon.
Carved-jade
objects
is
regarded
to
being
intrinsically
valuable.
They
are
metaphorically
equated
with
human
virtues
because
of
their
hardness,
durability,
and
(moral)
beauty.
Wukong's
signature
metallic
headband/coronet
which
Xuanzang
used
to
punish
Wukong
in
the
novel
only
appears
on
this
skin.
This
accessory
is
notably
absent
in
other
Wukong's
skins,
including
the
classic
one.
General
Wukong
also
plays
nod
to
some
traditional
armor
Sun
Wukong
wears
during
the
aforementioned
prequel
tale,
due
to
being
more
"war"
oriented
throughout
most
of
the
story
with
him
against
the
heavens.
It
also
nods
to
the
more
famous
title
of
Wukong
as
well,
the
Qitian
Dasheng/Seiten
Taisei
(齊天大聖,
lit.
Equaling
Heaven
Great
Sage).
The
Chinese
Splash
art
via
its
many
meteors
raining
down
may
be
a
reference
to
the
birthplace
of
Wukong,
known
as
Huaguo
Shan/Kakazan
(花果山,
lit.
Flower
Fruit
Mountain),
being
under
attack
during
said
tale.
A
glow
resembling
another
shaped
form
of
Wukong's
famous
headband/coronet
in
Journey
to
the
West
media
often
shows
on
his
forehead
on
most
of
Wukong's
other
skins
(save
for
his
Volcanic
skin
and
his
Classic
skin
in
the
original
artwork).
The
shape
of
the
glow
on
General
Wukong's
head
resembles
the
"coronets"
worn
by
two
of
the
original
Wukong's
companions,
the
aforementioned
Zhu
Bajie/Cho
Hakkai,
and
Sha
Wujing/Sha
Gojou
(沙悟凈,
lit.
Sand
Awakening
to
Purity).
Relations
Wukong
was
trained
in
the
Art
of
Wuju
by
Master
Yi
.
Due
to
this,
they
share
one
or
two
similar
quotes.
They
also
share
similar
utility
with
similar
items,
as
well
as
their
item
reliant
nature.
Wukong's
mystical
staff
was
crafted
by
Doran
.
Some
sources
state
Wukong
to
be
close
friends
with
Ahri
.
