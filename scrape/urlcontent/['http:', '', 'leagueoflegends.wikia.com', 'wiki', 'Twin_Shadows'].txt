For

the

worth

46g.
Strategy
The
lowest
base
movement
speed
in
the
game
is
325.
At
this
speed,
Twin
Shadows
grants
19.
5
movement
speed.
The
movement
speed
stat
only
increases
flat
movement
speed,
and
will
not
interact
with
other
percentage
increases.
Because
the
ghosts
target
the
closest
enemy
champions
even
when
you
don't
have
sight
of
them,
this
item
is
an
excellent
scouting
tool.
Champions
who
are
stealthed
at
the
moment
Twin
Shadows
is
activated
will
not
be
targeted
or
chased
by
the
ghosts.
However,
if
a
ghost
has
locked
onto
a
champion
that
then
proceeds
to
enter
stealth
before
the
ghost
makes
contact,
the
ghost
will
continue
to
chase
until
its
duration
ends
or
the
champion
leaves
stealth.
The
ghosts
appear
to
have
around
450
movement
speed
and
look
somewhat
similar
to
jungle
wraiths.
This
would
make
the
maximum
range
of
the
ghosts
2700.
It's
useful
for
even
mages,
the
ones
who
entirely
lack
CC
and
could
find
the
magic
resistance
enjoyable
can
safely
pick
this
item.
A
well
timed
spellshield
can
negate
the
effect
of
a
ghost
coming
into
contact
with
a
champion
It
is
possible
for
both
ghosts
to
hit
the
same
champion,
but
the
effect
and
duration
is
only
refreshed.
With
this
is
mind,
when
chasing
or
being
chased,
you
can
try
to
soak
up
both
ghosts
to
eliminate
them
as
a
threat.
In
the
Crystal
Scar,
the
ghosts
will
gain
bonus
movement
speed
while
moving
over
the
Speed
Shrines
.
Ghosts
may
not
pass
over
any
blocked
terrain,
such
as
Jarvan's
cataclysm,
you
may
use
this
to
your
advantage
to
prevent
the
vision
or
slow
effects
for
a
time.

Trivia
The
item
was
originally
called
Wraith
Collar
.
The
icon
for
this
item
looks
blue
while
in-game.
However,
it
looks
red
and
purple
in
summoners'
match
history.
Can
be
found
in
the
shop
by
searching
for
"Spooky
Ghosts".
"Release
The
Hounds!"
or
"Ghostbusters!"
are
phrases
commonly
shouted
when
Twin
Shadows
is
activated.
