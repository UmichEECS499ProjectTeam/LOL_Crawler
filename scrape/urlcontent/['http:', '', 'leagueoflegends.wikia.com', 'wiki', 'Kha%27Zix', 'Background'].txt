Champion
A
vicious
Void
predator,
Kha'Zix
infiltrated
Valoran
to
devour
the
land's
most
promising
creatures.
With
each
kill
he
absorbs
his
prey's
strength,
evolving
to
grow
more
powerful.
Kha'Zix
hungers
most
to
conquer
and
consume
Rengar
,
the
one
beast
he
considers
his
equal.
When
Kha'Zix
crossed
over
into
this
world,
he
was
fragile
and
ravenous.
The
animals
he
first
encountered
were
too
small
to
fuel
the
rapid
evolution
he
craved.
Kha'Zix
focused
his
hunger
on
the
most
dangerous
creatures
he
could
find,
risking
his
life
to
satisfy
his
need.
With
each
kill
he
feasted
and
changed,
becoming
a
stronger,
faster
predator.
Kha'Zix
soon
chased
his
prey
with
unrestrained
aggression,
believing
he
was
unstoppable.
One
day,
while
savoring
a
fresh
kill,
the
predator
became
the
prey.
From
cover
a
creature
pounced
in
a
blur
of
fangs
and
steel,
tackling
him
to
the
ground.
It
roared
in
his
face
slashing
and
clawing,
and
Kha'Zix
felt
his
blood
spill
for
the
first
time.
Screeching
in
fury,
he
sliced
at
the
brute's
eye
driving
it
back.
They
fought
from
sunset
to
sunrise.
Finally,
near
death,
they
reluctantly
separated.
As
his
wounds
closed,
Kha'Zix
burned
with
anticipation
at
the
idea
of
devouring
one
who
could
match
the
Void's
strength.
He
resumed
his
search
for
powerful
prey
with
renewed
vigor.
Someday,
Kha'Zix
will
feast
on
Rengar.

Consume.
Adapt."

Kha'Zix
sneak
peek
If
you
take
the
time
to
examine
the
many
wonders
of
nature,
you'll
find
a
fair
number
of
animals
that
are
remarkably
well-adapted
to
their
environment.
It
isn't
every
day,
however,
that
you
run
across
a
creature
that
can
adapt
to
every
environment.
Feast
your
eyes
on
this
fine
specimen
here.
Meet
Kha'Zix,
the
Voidreaver
–
the
most
highly-evolved
champion
yet
to
grace
the
Fields
of
Justice.
Maybe
you're
marveling
at
the
iridescent
wings
or
the
intimidating
spike
racks?
Well,
you’ll
find
that's
just
one
of
many
possible
evolutionary
paths
your
Voidreaver
can
take.
Perhaps
some
adaptive
camouflage
and
wicked,
scythe-like
claws
might
be
more
appropriate
to
your
particular
hunting
ground.
Whichever
evolutions
you
choose
to
manifest,
you'll
find
Kha'Zix
has
just
the
tools
you
need
to
viciously
slaughter
unsuspecting
prey.
If
you're
the
kind
of
assassin
that's
always
ready
to
adapt,
evolve,
and
overcome,
you'll
want
to
keep
an
eye
on
the
latest
addition
to
the
Void
lineup.
Kha'Zix,
the
Voidreaver,
Revealed
Announcement
made
by
NeeksNaman
:
[2]
Kha'Zix,
the
Voidreaver,
will
be
devouring
prey
on
the
Fields
of
Justice
in
the
upcoming
patch.
A
flexible
jungle
assassin,
Kha'Zix
excels
at
surprising
enemy
champions
and
quickly
dealing
massive
burst
damage.
Moreover,
his
unique
evolution
gameplay
allows
him
to
adapt
to
different
enemy
team
comps
and
strategies
by
customizing
his
abilities
over
the
course
of
the
match.
Here's
a
full
rundown
of
his
abilities:
Unseen
Threat
(Passive):
When
Kha'Zix
is
not
visible
to
the
enemy
team,
he
gains
Unseen
Threat,
causing
his
next
basic
attack
against
an
enemy
champion
to
deal
bonus
magic
damage
and
slow.
Taste
Their
Fear:
Deal
physical
damage
to
a
single
target.
Damage
against
isolated
targets
is
significantly
increased.
Kha'Zix
passively
marks
enemies
that
are
isolated
from
nearby
allies.
Evolving
claws
increases
damage
to
isolated
targets
even
further.
Kha'Zix
also
gains
increased
range
on
both
Taste
Their
Fear
and
his
basic
attack.
Void
Spike:
Kha'Zix
fires
spikes
that
explode
on
contact,
dealing
physical
damage
to
all
nearby
enemies.
Kha'Zix
is
healed
if
he
is
within
the
explosion
radius.
Evolving
spike
racks
causes
Void
Spike
to
fire
three
projectiles
in
a
cone.
Spikes
will
also
apply
Unseen
Threat
to
all
enemies
caught
within
the
area
of
effect.
Leap:
Kha'Zix
leaps
to
an
area,
dealing
physical
damage
to
enemies
in
the
area
he
lands.
Evolving
wings
increases
Leap's
range
dramatically
and
causes
a
kill
or
assists
to
refresh
the
cooldown
of
Leap.
Void
Assault:
Each
rank
of
Void
Assault
allows
Kha'Zix
to
evolve
one
of
his
active
abilities,
granting
it
an
additional
effect.
Upon
activation,
Kha'Zix
enters
stealth
and
gains
Unseen
Threat,
increasing
Movement
Speed.
Kha’zix
can
cast
Void
Assault
again
for
a
short
time
after
activation.
Evolving
active
camouflage
allows
Kha’Zix
to
cast
Void
Assault
three
times
over
the
course
of
its
duration
and
reduces
any
damage
he
sustains
while
in
stealth.
The
bonus
effects
that
Kha'Zix
accrues
for
ambushing
a
target
make
him
a
natural
jungler.
His
core
initiation
skill,
Leap,
allows
him
to
stage
ganks
from
unexpected
angles,
even
over
long
distances
or
across
terrain.
If
his
quarry
happens
to
be
a
lone
champion,
Kha'Zix
can
utilize
the
bonus
damage
from
Taste
Their
Fear
combined
with
the
initial
magic
damage
from
Unseen
Threat
to
truly
devastating
effect.
Remember
that
the
area
of
effect
damage
from
Void
Spike
can
help
clear
away
any
lingering
minions
to
isolate
a
foe,
making
them
vulnerable
to
some
additional
punishment.
Once
he's
initiated,
clever
repositioning
can
allow
Kha'Zix
to
break
line
of
sight
and
refresh
Unseen
Threat.
Juking
into
the
brush,
using
Leap
to
withdraw
and
reinitiate,
or
entering
stealth
by
casting
Void
Assault
will
allow
the
Voidreaver
to
continually
slow
enemies
and
lay
down
bonus
damage
from
his
passive.
Cunning
use
of
Unseen
Threat
is
key
to
maximizing
Kha'Zix's
damage
potential.
Later
in
the
match,
Void
Assault
allows
Kha'Zix
to
safely
and
aggressively
navigate
team
fights.
After
leaping
into
combat,
Kha'Zix
can
use
his
ultimate
to
evade
attacks
while
he
picks
apart
vulnerable
members
of
the
enemy
team.
Once
he's
downed
an
opponent,
activating
Void
Assault
again
can
allow
him
to
either
safely
withdraw
or
reinitiate
on
another
target
with
Unseen
Threat.
Each
of
Kha'Zix's
active
abilities
can
also
be
evolved
to
provide
greater
utility.
At
Levels
6,
11,
and
16,
he'll
gain
an
Evolution
Point
that
can
be
spent
to
unlock
additional
effects
on
a
specific
skill.
If
you'd
like
greater
hit
and
run
potential,
for
example,
choosing
to
evolve
Void
Assault
and
Leap
can
drastically
increase
your
mobility
by
offering
additional
stealth
and
a
second
Leap
after
scoring
a
kill
or
assist.
If
you
find
yourself
falling
behind,
combining
Void
Assualt
with
Void
Spike
can
give
you
increased
durability
in
team
fights
and
greater
farming
and
poke
potential
while
you
catch
up
on
gold.
Tailoring
your
evolutions
to
address
the
challenges
of
a
specific
match-up
can
give
you
that
extra
edge
you
need
to
finish
strong
in
a
close
matchup.
