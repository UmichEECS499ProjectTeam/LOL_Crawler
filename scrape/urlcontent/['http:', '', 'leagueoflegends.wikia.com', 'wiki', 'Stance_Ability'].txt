A
Stance
Ability
is
a
special
type
of
ability
,
which
provide
a
persistent
effect
that
lasts
as
long
as
the
stance
is
active,
and
an
activation
effect,
which
gives
benefits
in
the
first
instants
of
the
activation.
Rapid
stance
changing
is
prevented
by
a
usually
fairly
low
(1-2
seconds)
shared
cooldown
(or
global
cooldown
(GCD)),
which
places
all
other
stance-like
skills
on
cooldown
whenever
a
stance
is
activated.
Stances
were
introduced
with
the
creation
of
Udyr
.
When
a
stance
is
activated,
an
initial
effect
is
performed,
plus
the
champion
will
get
a
persistent
effect
as
long
as
he
doesn't
change
stance.
Persistent
effects
are
mutually
exclusive,
but
activation
effects
may
overlap
if
the
shared
cooldown
is
low
enough.
The
one
exception
to
this
is
that
Sona's
auras
persist
for
1
seconds
after
the
activation
of
the
next
stance.
Example:
Stance
A
grants
a
shield
when
activated
and
life
steal
as
its
persistent
effect.
Stance
B
grants
an
increased
movement
speed
on
activation
and
a
stun
every
5
seconds
as
persistent
effect.
Activating
stance
A
and
then
quickly
stance
B
will
grant
the
champion
a
shield,
a
movement
speed
bonus
and
the
ability
to
stun
every
5
seconds,
but
no
life
steal.
Sona's
Hymn
of
Valor
provides
an
AD
/
AP
aura,
if
she
switches
to
Aria
of
Perseverance
,
the
AD
/
AP
aura
will
remain
for
1
additional
seconds.
Champions
that
currently
use
the
stance
mechanic
are
Udyr
and
Sona
.
Udyr
stances
grant
him
persistent
buffs
to
his
autoattacks
,
and
continually
switching
stance
increase
his
attack
speed.
Sona
instead
has
auto-targeted
skills
when
she
activates
a
stance
and
persistent
auras
that
benefit
her
allies.
