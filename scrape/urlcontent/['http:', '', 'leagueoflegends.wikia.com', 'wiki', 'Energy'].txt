Energy
is
a
resource
used
to
fuel
the
basic
abilities
(ultimates
are
free
of
cost)
of
certain
champions
in
place
of
mana
.
It
is
represented
by
a
yellow
bar
instead
of
blue.
Since
energy
regenerates
much
faster
than
mana,
energy
champions
are
not
at
the
risk
of
depleting
their
resource
over
time.
However,
due
to
the
maximum
amount
of
energy
being
capped
at
200
with
no
growth
per
level,
their
ability
combos
can
deplete
energy
in
an
important
situation
and
leave
them
unable
to
cast
spells
for
a
few
crucial
seconds
while
their
energy
regenerates
(unlike
mana
champions,
whose
mana
pools
increase,
nullifying
this
problem
as
the
game
goes
on).
To
aid
this,
they
all
have
abilities
that
can
refund
a
small
amount
of
energy
under
particular
conditions,
if
the
actions
are
executed
properly.
Unlike
mana,
the
maximum
energy
of
a
champion
cannot
be
increased
with
items
;
however,
energy
regen
can
be
increased
with
Ichor
of
Illumination
,
available
only
on
Twisted
Treeline.
Maximum
energy
can
be
enhanced
with
certain
runes
,
and
energy
regeneration
can
be
increased
with
certain
runes
and
the
Crest
of
the
Ancient
Golem
buff.

Basics
The
base
maximum
for
energy
is
set
to
200.
You
can
increase
this
value
by
up
to
36
additional
energy
by
using
flat
runes
,
and
42
through
scaling.
The
base
energy
regeneration
is
10
energy
regenerated
every
second
(50
per
5s),
effectively
requiring
20
seconds
to
regenerate
the
entire
energy
pool.
In
Dominion,
the
base
energy
regeneration
is
set
to
12
per
second
(60
per
5s),
effectively
requiring
16.
7
seconds
to
regenerate
the
entire
energy
pool.
You
can
regenerate
another
3.
015
energy
per
second
(15.
075
per
5s)
at
level
18
by
using
runes
.
The
blue
buff
increases
the
energy
regeneration
by
0.
5
%
of
your
maximum
energy
per
second,
plus
5
flat
per
second.
This
means
that
it
will
additionally
regenerate
from
6
energy
per
second
(with
the
default
200
energy)
to
6.
21
energy
per
second
(with
242
energy
from
runes).
Ichor
of
Illumination
increases
the
energy
regeneration
by
0.
5
%
of
your
maximum
energy
per
second
plus
3
per
second.
This
means
that
it
will
additionally
regenerate
from
4
energy
per
second
(with
the
default
200
energy)
to
4.
21
energy
per
second
(with
242
energy
from
runes).

A
champion's
energy
can
be
restored
in
several
ways:
Energy

(See
below
section)
Returning
to
the

pool,
which
restores
a
percentage
of

Using
abilities
which
restore
energy
like:
Akali's
Mark
of
the
Assassin
Kennen's
Mark
of
the
Storm
and
Lightning
Rush
Lee
Sin's
Flurry
Shen's
Ki
Strike
and
Shadow
Dash
Zed's
Living
Shadow
Energy
Runes
Runes
are
the
only
way
to
increase
energy
regeneration
besides
the
Crest
of
the
Ancient
Golem
buff
and
Ichor
of
Illumination
.
Runes
are
also
the
only
way
to
increase
maximum
energy.
There
are
two
different
types
of
runes
that
affect
energy:
Runes
that
increase
max
energy.
Runes
that
increase
energy
regeneration.
In
particular,
3
Greater
Quintessences
of
Energy
and
9
Greater
Glyphs
of
Scaling
Energy
will
grant
the
most
possible
max
energy
at
level
18,
giving
42.
3
more
energy,
while
3
Greater
Quintessences
of
Energy
Regeneration
and
9
Greater
Seals
of
Scaling
Energy
will
grant
the
most
possible
energy
regeneration
at
level
18
(15.
075
more
energy
regenerated
per
5
seconds).
Also
note
that
energy
runes
are
only
available
as
Tier
3
runes,
are
quite
expensive,
and
they
currently
only
affect
a
small
number
of
champions.
