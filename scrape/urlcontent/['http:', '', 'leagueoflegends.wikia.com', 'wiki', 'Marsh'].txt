Lore
It
is
known
that
it
is
a
place
filled
with
undead.
History
The
vast
quantities
of
physical
magic
that
were
consumed
and
destroyed
during
Valoran's
numerous
Rune
Wars
have
scarred
much
of
Valoran.
The
Howling
Marsh
is
one
of
them.
During
his
childhood,
Tryndamere
's
clan
moved
south
between
the
Howling
Marsh
and
the
Ironspike
Mountains.
It
is
also
the
location
of
the
massacre
where
he
was
a
sole
survivor.
Also,
as
Durand
crossed
the
Howling
Marsh
with
his
masterwork
in
tow,
he
was
set
upon
by
Noxian
assassins
in
force.
Outnumbered
and
overwhelmed,
Galio
looked
on
in
horror
as
the
murderers
cut
down
his
charge,
executing
him
swiftly
before
vanishing
back
into
the
mists.
He
stayed
there
feeling
guilty
for
his
master's
death.
Later
Poppy
passed
by
the
Marshes
and
rested
right
in
front
of
Galio
without
even
noticing
him.
This
later
inspired
him
to
return
as
the
Sentinel
of
Demacia.
Trivia
Previously,
Karthus,
the
Deathsinger
was
the
self-appointed
overlord
of
the
marshes.
On
the
darkest
of
nights
he
would
sing
the
tales
of
those
who
have
journeyed
and
perished
in
it.
