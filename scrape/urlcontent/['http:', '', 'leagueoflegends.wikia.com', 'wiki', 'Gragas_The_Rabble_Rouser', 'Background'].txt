The
only
thing
more
important
to
Gragas
than
fighting
is
drinking.
His
unquenchable
thirst
for
stronger
ale
has
led
him
in
search
of
the
most
potent
and
unconventional
ingredients
to
toss
in
his
still.
Impulsive
and
unpredictable,
this
rowdy
carouser
loves
cracking
kegs
as
much
as
cracking
heads.
Thanks
to
his
strange
brews
and
temperamental
nature,
drinking
with
Gragas
is
always
a
risky
proposition.
Gragas
has
an
eternal
love
of
good
drink,
but
his
massive
constitution
prevented
him
from
reaching
a
divine
state
of
intoxication.
One
night,
when
he
had
drained
all
the
kegs
and
was
left
wanting,
Gragas
was
struck
by
a
thought
rather
than
the
usual
barstool:
why
couldn't
he
brew
himself
something
that
would
finally
get
him
truly
drunk?
It
was
then
that
he
vowed
to
create
the
ultimate
ale.
Gragas'
quest
eventually
brought
him
to
the
Freljord
,
where
the
promise
of
acquiring
the
purest
arctic
water
for
his
recipe
led
him
into
uncharted
glacial
wastes.
While
lost
in
an
unyielding
blizzard,
Gragas
stumbled
upon
a
great
howling
abyss
.
There
he
found
it:
a
flawless
shard
of
ice
unlike
anything
he
had
ever
seen.
Not
only
did
this
unmelting
shard
imbue
his
lager
with
incredible
properties,
but
it
also
had
a
handy
side
effect
-
it
kept
the
mixture
chilled
at
the
perfect
serving
temperature.
Under
the
spell
of
his
new
concoction,
Gragas
headed
for
civilization,
eager
to
share
the
fermented
fruits
of
his
labor.
As
fate
would
have
it,
the
first
gathering
to
catch
Gragas'
bleary
eyes
would
shape
the
future
of
the
Freljord.
He
blundered
into
a
deteriorating
negotiation
between
two
tribes
discussing
an
alliance
with
Ashe
.
Though
Ashe
welcomed
a
break
in
the
tension,
the
other
warriors
bristled
at
the
intrusion
and
hurled
insults
at
the
drunken
oaf.
True
to
his
nature,
Gragas
replied
with
a
diplomatic
headbutt,
setting
off
a
brawl
matched
only
in
the
legends
of
the
Freljord.
When
the
fallen
from
that
great
melee
finally
awoke,
Ashe
proposed
a
friendly
drink
as
an
alternative
to
fighting.
With
their
tempers
doused
in
suds,
the
two
tribes,
formerly
on
the
brink
of
war,
bonded
over
a
common
love
of
Gragas'
brew.
Although
strife
was
averted
and
Gragas
hailed
a
hero,
he
still
had
not
achieved
his
dream
of
drunken
blissfulness.
So
once
more,
he
set
off
to
wander
the
tundra
in
search
of
ingredients
for
Runeterra's
perfect
pint.
"Now
this'll
put
hair
on
your
chest!"
―
Gragas
The
foothills
of
the
Great
Barrier
are
home
to
the
hardiest
people
found
anywhere
on
Valoran
.
Only
those
with
great
fortitude
and
endurance
dwell
in
what
is
perhaps
the
most
rugged
and
unforgiving
environment
anywhere
on
the
face
of
Runeterra
.
It
is
here
that
the
mighty
Gragas
keeps
permanent
residence,
living
south
of
Noxus
.
This
behemoth
of
a
man
has
long
eschewed
the
rigors
of
civilization
for
what
he
calls
his
"slice
of
paradise";
he
has
no
neighbors
to
bother
him
and
plenty
of
space
to
pursue
his
life's
ambition
-
brewing.
Grogs,
ales,
meads,
and
wine
-
nothing
is
beyond
his
skill
to
brew.
What
makes
Gragas
a
truly
special
brewmaster,
however,
is
his
proximity
to
a
large
and
powerful
nexus
.
The
magic
of
this
nexus
has
seeped
into
his
fermented
creations,
and
Gragas
has
consumed
enough
of
his
own
poison
over
the
years
to
slake
the
thirst
of
an
army.
This
arcane
alcohol
has
caused
Gragas
to
swell
both
in
height
and
girth;
he
looms
over
the
tallest
of
men
and
boasts
nearly
twice
their
width.
To
complement
his
immoderate
size,
Gragas
has
developed
an
ornery
temper
-
one
fueled
by
liquor
and
raw
magic.
His
infrequent
sojourns
into
Noxus
for
supplies
always
unfold
the
same
way:
Gragas
enters
a
Noxian
tavern,
Gragas
gets
into
several
fights,
Gragas
lays
out
countless
citizens,
and
finally
Gragas
flees
for
the
foothills
with
Noxian
constables
in
hot
-
though
reluctant
-
pursuit.
His
misadventures
have
garnered
him
the
attention
of
several
summoners
in
the
League
of
Legends
,
and
he
is
now
a
willing
champion
in
the
arenas...doling
out
hard
liquor
and
harder
fists.
"The
Rabble
Rouser
leaves
a
path
of
drunken
destruction
in
his
wake,
both
in
the
Fields
of
Justice
and
off."
