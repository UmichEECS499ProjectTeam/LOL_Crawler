Trivia
Ashe
was
designed
by
Ezreal
and
Guinsoo
.
She
is
the
protagonist
champion
of
Howling
Abyss
,
the
tutorial
map.
Ashe
was
the
first
champion
to
have
a
full
rework
of
her
Splash
Arts.
Ashe
is
currently
the
only
champion,
as
of
late
Season
3's
champion
classification,
to
be
recognized
as
both
a
support
and
marksman
champion.
Ashe's
voice-over
is
done
by
Melissa
Hutchison
.
[1]
.
One
of
Ashe's
arrows
can
be
seen
shot
through
an
apple
in
the
Mac
Version
Launch
of
League
of
Legends.
Her
bow
is
also
seen
in
a
later
part
of
the
video.
Ashe
is
the
only
champion
to
have
exactly
1.0
scaling
for
both
AD
and
AP
on
all
her
abilities
with
AD/AP
ratios;
her
attack
damage
and
ability
power
are
added
without
multiplication
to
the
damage
output
of
her
Volley
and
Enchanted
Crystal
Arrow
,
respectively.
Several
champions
like
Ezreal
have
1.0
AD
scaling,
but
has
varying
AP
scaling,
while
other
champions
like
Veigar
have
1.0
AP
scaling
but
no
AD
scaling.
Ashe
was
one
of
the
champions
chosen
for
the
Ionian
pool
available
during
the
2010
Ionian
Versus
Noxus
Grudge
Match
.
She
was
one
of
the
selected
champions.
Ashe's
dance
references
to
Alizee's
J'en
Ai
Marre!
dance.
A
side
by
side
comparison
can
be
seen
here.
Ashe
is
possibly
inspired
by
several
Dota
heroes.
Her
appearance
and
her
kit
are
somewhat
similar
to
those
of
Traxex
the
Drow
Ranger
.
Ashe's
ultimate
is
very
similar
to
Mirana's
Arrow
skill,
except
that
Ashe's
arrow
can
travel
across
the
whole
map
while
Mirana
has
a
shorter
range
and
smaller
hitbox.
Ashe's
bow
belonged
to
the
ancient
queen
of
Freljord
,
Avarosa.
Ashe
and
Ashelia
B'nargin
Dalmasca
from
Final
Fantasy
XII
shares
similar
name,
both
are
princesses
and
then
became
the
queen,
use
ranged
weapons(Ashelia
uses
Hand-Bombs
in
the
sequel;
Final
Fantasy
XII:
Revenant
Wings)
and
both
were
once
hunted
to
apprehend
them
from
becoming
a
leader
to
their
people.
There's
an
event
between
Ashe
,
Sejuani
,
and
Lissandra
that
is
similar
to
"
The
Hunt
is
On!
",
called,
"
Battle
for
Freljord
".
This
makes
it
a
2nd
event
to
happen
in-game
but
not
directly
to
the
lore.
Quotes
Ashe's
joke,
"No,
really.
Put
that
apple
on
your
head!"
is
a
reference
to
William
Tell
,
specifically
his
apple-shot
.
Ashe's
quote
to
Sejuani
;
"So,
which
one
is
the
pig?"
,
is
a
reference
to
the
video,
Rammus
Taunts
Everyone
AGAIN
.
Ashe
currently
holds
the
most
number
of
taunts
in
the
game.
She
has
3
default
taunts
and
3
special
taunts
for
both
Sejuani
and
Lissandra
,
combining
a
total
of
9
taunts.
Second
to
her
is
Blackfrost
Anivia
,
having
2
default
taunts
and
2
special
taunts
each
for
Ashe
,
Sejuani
and
Lissandra
,
combining
a
total
of
8.
Skins
Ashe
appears
to
be
ambidextrous
.
In
her
Classic,
Freljord,
Sherwood
Forest
and
Woad
skins,
she
holds
her
bow
in
her
left
hand,
but
in
her
Queen,
Amethyst,
and
Heartseeker
skins,
she
holds
her
bow
in
her
right
hand.
Sherwood
Forest
Ashe
is
a
reference
to
Robin
Hood
.
In
all
of
her
other
skins,
Ashe
seems
to
have
blue
eyes,
but
in
her
Sherwood
Forest
skin,
she
appears
to
have
green
eyes.
Woad
Ashe
references
the
medieval
Picts
tribes,
also
known
as
the
"Woads".
Queen
Ashe
is
a
lore
reference
to
her
role
as
the
leader
of
Freljord
.
Amethyst
Ashe
is
likely
a
reference
to
Amethystos,
a
maiden
that
was
changed
into
amethyst
in
Greek
mythology.
Amethyst
is
a
violet
variety
of
quartz
often
used
in
jewelry.
The
Woad
Ashe
artwork
bears
a
strong
resemblance
to
Guinevere
from
the
2004
movie
King
Arthur
.
The
Chinese
version
of
Ashe's
original
skin
is
the
background
image
of
the
"Offense"
section
in
the
mastery
pages.
Ashe
shares
the
Heartseeker
theme
with
Vayne
.
Heartseeker
Ashe
is
categorized
as
"Miscellaneous"
when
the
champion
skins
are
filtered
by
champion
in
the
store.
Relations
Ashe
is
close
friends
with
fellow
League
champions
Anivia
and
Nunu
.
After
Ashe
became
the
Queen
of
Freljord,
she
personally
appointed
Nunu
as
Freljord's
League
Emissary.
Ashe
is
married
to
Tryndamere
,
though
she
states
that
this
is
not
for
romantic
reasons
but
for
political
ones.
Based
on
the
results
of
Blitzcrank's
"Fleshling
Compatibility
Services"
,
Ashe
and
Tryndamere
are
considered
a
successful
match
for
each
other.
Outside
the
game,
Ashe
and
Tryndamere's
relationship
is
possibly
a
private
Riot
reference.
Tryndamere
is
the
nickname
of
their
president,
Marc
Merrill
,
whose
wife's
name
is
Ashley
(as
revealed
in
this
thread
by
Merrill).
Ashe
and
Tryndamere
have
struck
a
business
partnership
with
Gragas
,
selling
him
ownership
of
Freljord's
Avarosa
Iceflow
glacier.
He
had
also,
apparently,
solved
the
problem
of
a
unification
of
a
lesser
tribe
with
the
Avarosan
tribe
by
getting
everyone
drunk
and
drowning
their
troubles
away.
Ashe
is
in
direct
conflict
with
Sejuani
,
who
opposes
Ashe's
claim
as
the
Queen
of
Freljord.
Ashe
is
a
distant
relative
to
Sejuani
as
they
both
descended
from
two
of
the
three
legendary
princesses,
who
were
sisters
to
one
another.
Ashe
descending
from
Avarosa
while
Sejuani
from
Serylda.
Ashe
met
with
Quinn
and
Valor
while
the
two
were
on
a
scouting
expedition
into
Freljord
.
Valor
likes
her,
which
is
rare.
Ashe
and
her
people
are
allied
with
Lissandra
's,
unaware
to
this
day
about
her
true
identity
as
the
Ice
Witch.
Lissandra
is
one
of
the
three
legendary
sisters,
making
her
an
ancient
ancestor
of
hers.
The
Lyte's
quote
to
her;
"You
bear
a
striking
resemblance
to
Avarosa!"
hints
at
the
possibility
that
Ashe
is
a
direct
descendant
of
hers.
This
is
further
supported
by
the
fact
that
Ashe
was
lead
by
a
great
hawk
to
Avarosa's
grave
where
she
found
the
true
ice
bow
she
now
uses
in
the
Fields
of
Justice
.
