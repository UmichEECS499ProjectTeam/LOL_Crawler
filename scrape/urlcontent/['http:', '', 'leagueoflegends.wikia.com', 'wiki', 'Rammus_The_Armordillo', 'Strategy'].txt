Skill
usage
Powerball
can
interrupt
jump
moves
such
as
Jax's
Leap
Strike
or
Tristana's
Rocket
Jump
mid-jump.
Abilities
such
as
Jax's
Leap
Strike
,
Garen's
Decisive
Strike
and
Xin
Zhao's
Audacious
Charge
will
not
stop
Powerball
if
Rammus
is
accelerating
in
the
opposite
direction.
If
an
enemy
Renekton
uses
Slice
and
Dice
through
Rammus
while
he
is
using
Powerball
,
the
ability
won't
be
cancelled.
Defensive
Ball
Curl
increases
Rammus's
armor
,
which
increases
his
damage
due
to
Spiked
Shell
by
10
/
15
/
20
/
25
/
30.
Powerball
can
be
used
as
an
effective
escape
mechanism.
It
also
has
a
slight
knock-back
effect,
and
this
allows
for
you
to
run
into
pursuers
to
momentarily
disable
them.
As
Powerball
speeds
up
continuously
after
the
initial
cast,
it's
sometimes
better
to
let
it
speed
up
in
a
brush
before
rolling
at
someone.
Flash
can
be
used
while
in
Powerball
to
jump
across
a
minion
wave
to
catch
your
opponent
off-guard.
Powerball
can
hit
stealthed
champions
such
as
Twitch
,
Shaco
,
Akali
,
or
Evelynn
,
dealing
damage
and
knocking
them
back.
It
will
also
work
against
a
Camouflaged
Teemo
,
knocking
him
out
of
stealth.
This
can
be
useful
for
chasing
them
if
they
go
stealthed
at
low
health.
You
can
use
Powerball
then
use
Teleport
to
be
at
a
high
speed
when
reaching
your
destination.
This
is
also
amazing
in
conjunction
with
Homeguard
.
Powerball
will
damage
and
slow
enemies
reviving
from
pseudo
death
(
Guardian
Angel
or
Zilean's
Chrono
Shift
)
or
Zhonya's
Hourglass
,
granting
an
easy
kill.
Puncturing
Taunt
can
be
used
on
enemies
pushing
your
turret
to
make
them
attack
you
and
causing
the
turret
to
attack
them.
It
can
also
be
used
to
take
the
focus
off
more
squishy
allies,
allowing
them
to
deal
more
damage
than
they
would
have
had
they
been
the
focused
target.
Puncturing
Taunt
can
also
be
used
to
"pull"
enemies
towards
your
team
as
an
enemy
will
be
forced
to
get
into
attack
range
to
hit
you.
This
is
more
effective
with
melee
champions
whose
attack
range
is
shorter
than
ranged
ones.
When
using
Tremors
,
you
can
use
all
your
spells
to
keep
enemies
in
range
of
this
spell
in
order
to
maximize
damage.
This
is
possible
because
the
ultimate
is
not
channelled.
Tremors
affects
turrets,
making
Rammus
a
very
good
pusher,
especially
late
game
when
he
can
tank
the
turret
for
his
team.
Backdooring
is
a
simple
matter
because
you
can
easily
use
Powerball
to
run
away
before
enemies
catch
up.
Rammus
can
use
Tremors
while
using
Powerball
,
making
it
very
useful
for
destroying
towers
or
champions
that
are
low
on
health
and
escaping.
Build
usage
Building
armor
is
necessary
to
put
Spiked
Shell
to
good
use.
Having
a
lot
of
armor
will
still
result
in
a
large
amount
of
damage.
However,
do
not
disregard
building
magic
resistance
,
as
your
high
armor
stat
means
nothing
to
the
enemy
team's
AP
mages
.
It
can
however
be
argued
that
building
health
will
synergize
better
with
the
free
armor
and
magic
resistance
provided
by
Defensive
Ball
Curl
.
Chalice
of
Harmony
can
be
helpful
for
laning
mana
issues
and
building
magic
resistance.
Archangel's
Staff
is
a
more
offensive
alternative
to
his
mana
problems.
Get
it
if
you'll
be
buying
at
least
one
more
item
providing
mana
e.g.
Frozen
Heart
and/or
Odyn's
Veil
.
Randuin's
Omen
in
conjunction
with
Puncturing
Taunt
and
Defensive
Ball
Curl
allows
you
to
slow
the
enemy
team
heavily
and
make
chasing
easier.
However,
it
reduces
the
enemies
attack
speed
so
they
wont
get
as
many
reflected
hits
off
you
when
you
taunt
them
Atma's
Impaler
synergizes
well
with
Spiked
Shell
,
increasing
his
damage
further
while
also
providing
armor.
Thornmail
is
a
very
effective
item
on
Rammus
,
as
it
reflects
damage
from
auto-attacks
(which
the
enemy
is
forced
to
use
during
Puncturing
Taunt
)
as
well
as
stacks
with
the
reflecting
damage
given
during
Defensive
Ball
Curl
.
Talisman
of
Ascension
's
active
synergizes
well
with
Rammus's
Powerball
.
Rammus's
Tremors
and
Powerball
can
deal
massive
damage
with
some
ability
power.
This
makes
Zhonya's
Hourglass
a
rather
potent
item
as
it
also
provides
a
large
amount
of
armor.
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
can
be
a
powerful
item
,
causing
Tremors
to
slow
a
massive
area,
slowing
on
Defensive
Ball
Curl
if
you
don't
have
Randuin's
Omen
,
very
slightly
increasing
Powerball
's
slow,
and
providing
a
high
amount
of
health
.
Another
powerful
item
is
Liandry's
Torment
,
which
is
applied
on
enemies
attacking
Rammus
during
Defensive
Ball
Curl
,
and
can
also
be
applied
with
Rammus's
Powerball
or
Tremors
.
It
synergizes
well
with
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
,
and
also
provides
a
generous
amount
of
health
.
Sunfire
Cape
also
synergizes
well
with
Tremors
.
Jungling
Rammus
is
a
strong
jungler,
with
exceptional
ganks.
Powerball
allows
him
to
initiate
ganks
suddenly,
and
Puncturing
Taunt
is
a
strong
CC
ability
with
a
fairly
long
duration.
Note
that
Rammus's
Powerball
,
whilst
it
still
does
damage,
it
has
no
crowd
control
effect
on
Baron
Nashor
or
the
Dragon
.
Also
note
that
Puncturing
Taunt
now
has
absolutely
no
effect
on
Baron
or
Dragon
(it
will
not
reduce
armor
or
force
either
to
attack
you).
Both
skills
will
still
affect
all
other
neutral
creeps
as
normal.

Countering
Avoid
attacking
Rammus
while
his
Defensive
Ball
Curl
is
active.
Try
to
purchase
tenacity
items
early
to
reduce
the
duration
of
his
taunt
from
his
Puncturing
Taunt
.
Be
careful;
even
with
35
tenacity
Puncturing
Taunt
will
last
for
up
to
1.
46
seconds.
Try
casting
a
slow
or
stun
when
he
uses
Powerball
so
that
way
Rammus
cannot
initiate
with
his
full
combo
by
using
Puncturing
Taunt
,
Defensive
Ball
Curl
and
Tremors
straight
after
hitting
a
target
with
Powerball
.
Be
aware
that
crowd
control
abilities
will
not
stop
Rammus's
Powerball
while
it
is
active,
but
will
slow/stun/snare
him
in
place,
allowing
you
to
potentially
dodge
the
attack.
Rammus
is
an
excellent
counter
to
all
AD
carries
due
to
his
Defensive
Ball
Curl
and
tendency
to
build
high
armor.
It
is
wise
to
have
a
mage
or
a
hybrid
champion
(e.g.
Jax
or
Akali
)
take
him
down.
Building
a
Last
Whisper
will
penetrate
his
armor,
allowing
you
to
deal
more
damage
to
him.
If
Rammus
is
building
AP
don't
let
your
guard
down,
Powerball
and
Tremors
have
decent
AP
ratios
and
low
cooldowns.
