Assassins
An
assassin
is
an
agile
champion
that
specializes
in
killing
or
disabling
high
value
targets.
Focused
on
infiltration,
deception,
and
mobility,
assassins
are
opportunistic
hunters
who
find
favorable
moments
within
a
fight
before
jumping
into
the
fray.
Regardless
of
the
size
of
the
enemy
team,
assassins
specialize
in
positioning
and
artful
killing.
They
strike
when
the
time
is
right
–
no
sooner,
no
later.
