Trivia
Zilean
was
designed
by
Ezreal
.
Zilean
is
named
after
Tom
'Zileas'
Cadwell
,
the
Design
Director
for
Riot
Games.
Zilean's
Time
Bomb
is
the
only
ability
in
game
that
doesn't
scale
linearly,
meaning
that
the
increasing
damage
given
out
for
each
rank
in
the
ability
is
potencialy
different
than
the
previous
one.
After
the
base
damage
of
90
at
rank
1,
Rank
2
and
3
give
55
damage,
while
4
and
5
give
60.
Zilean's
concept
may
be
inspired
by
the
fictional
personification
of
time,
Father
Time
,
who
is
usually
depicted
as
an
elderly
bearded
man,
dressed
in
a
robe,
carrying
an
hourglass
or
some
other
timekeeping
device.
Zilean's
back
story
is
similar
to
the
book
Slaughterhouse-Five
by
Kurt
Vonnegut,
Junior.
The
main
character,
Billy
Pilgrim,
discovers
that
he
randomly
jumps
between
different
moments
of
his
life,
but
is
unable
to
change
anything
that
has
happened.
He
relives
his
life
at
random
intervals
from
birth
to
death
for
all
eternity.
When
Zilean
is
in
a
match
where
an
enemy
Volibear
is
present,
he
gets
a
buff
called
Armored
Bear
Hater
.
This
icon
reads:
"In
my
day,
we
would
never
have
allowed
an
armored
bear
into
the
League
of
Legends."
Volibear
also
gains
an
icon
when
Zilean
is
in
the
opposing
team.
Allied
Volibear
is
unaffected.
Additionally,
if
the
enemy
Volibear
kills
Zilean,
he
will
remark
"I
have
a
special
claw
for
you,
Zilean"
or
"Your
time
has
come,
Chronokeeper."
This
is
a
reference
to
Zileas
,
who
was
against
the
possibility
of
Armored
Bears
on
the
forums.
Zilean's
Time
Warp
has
the
longest
duration
of
any
crowd
control
effect
in
the
game
at
5.5
seconds.
Followed
by
Nasus's
Wither
which
is
5
seconds.
Chrono
Shift
can
cause
a
gamebreaking
bug:
if
Kog'Maw
with
Chrono
Shift
dies,
his
passive
would
trigger
immediately
and
then,
once
again
after
4
seconds,
dealing
up
to
1100
overall
AoE
true
damage
at
level
18.
Zilean
is
the
first
champion
to
have
a
non-ultimate
ability
which
can
not
be
ranked
up
at
level
1.
The
ability
is
Rewind
,
since
Rewind
can
only
be
used
to
reduce
other
abilities'
cooldowns,
making
the
spell
useless
if
ranked
at
level
1.
Zilean
was
the
first
champion
to
be
released
after
initial
release.
The
icon
for
Zilean's
Time
Bomb
is
similar
to
Jax's
Grandmaster's
Might
.
Zilean's
Heightened
Learning
and
Time
Warp
uses
the
same
icon,
except
it
is
inverted
and
has
different
glow
on
the
arrows.
Quotes
Zilean's
joke
is
a
reference
to
a
Groucho
Marx
quote
.
Skins
Chinese
Classic
Zilean's
splash
art
is
used
as
the
installation
background
when
installing
the
game.
Old
Saint
Zilean
is
a
reference
to
Santa
Claus
,
who
is
sometimes
referred
to
as
"Old
Saint
Nick".
A
cuckoo
clock
with
Teemo
can
be
seen
on
the
art.
Groovy
Zilean
is
a
reference
to
the
hippie
subculture,
a
movement
that
arose
in
the
United
States
during
the
mid-1960s.
Groovy
Zilean
is
based
on
the
idea
"Flowerkeeper"
created
by
DarkeTiger
and
Empio.
Time
Machine
Zilean
is
a
reference
to
H.G.
Wells
science-fiction
novella,
The
Time
Machine
.
Classic
Zilean's
Chinese
splash
art
is
used
as
the
background
when
you
have
abandoned
a
match.
On
28
December,
2013,
two
of
Zilean's
skins
were
on
sale.
Time
Machine
Zilean
was
a
legacy
skin
that
was
available
and
on
sale,
and
Groovy
Zilean
was
part
of
the
normal
champion/skin
sales.
Relations
Zilean
joined
the
League
to
find
a
cure
for
a
disease
called
chrono-displasia,
and
to
save
his
people.
Zilean
constantly
consults
Ryze
,
for
using
summoning
magic,
similar
to
magic
that
summoners
use,
to
find
a
cure.
Ryze
stated
that
they
are
close
to
the
cure.
It
was
Zilean
who
developed
the
temporal
stasis
bubble
that
halted
the
war
in
Kalamanda
.
The
high
amount
of
magic
used
for
the
bubble
also
led
to
the
awakening
of
Skarner
.
Due
to
the
fact
that
the
Riot
design
director,
Zileas,
was
adamantly
against
the
implementation
of
armored
bears,
Volibear
and
Zilean
dislike
each
other.
During
his
investigations
on
Valoran,
Vel'Koz
and
a
few
other
voidlings
came
across
the
now
abandoned
Urtistan,
Zilean's
birthplace
and
former
residence,
eventually
making
his
way
into
Zilean's
tower.
The
voidborn
discovered
what
in
his
opinion
is
the
ultimate
knowledge
and
very
advanced
pieces
of
technology.
However,
to
make
sure
the
other,
more
destructive
void
creatures
didn't
destroy
these
pieces
of
information,
he
killed
them.
Vel'
Koz
is
now
on
the
search
for
Zilean
(hinting
at
his
reasons
to
join
the
League
of
Legends
),
as
he
thinks
he
holds
this
ultimate
knowledge
