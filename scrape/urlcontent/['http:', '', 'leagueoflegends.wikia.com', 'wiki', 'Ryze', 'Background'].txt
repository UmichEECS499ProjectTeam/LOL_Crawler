There
are
many
on
Runeterra
who
are
attracted
to
the
study
of
magic
or,
in
recent
times,
the
emerging
field
of
techmaturgy.
For
most,
pursuit
of
such
knowledge
is
formalized
in
a
college
or
university.
The
halls
of
traditional
study
were
never
for
Ryze,
however,
who
felt
a
more
raw
and
primal
connection
to
the
magic
of
Runeterra
than
those
who
tried
to
teach
him.
He
struck
out
on
his
own
as
a
young
man
to
discover
what
already
called
to
him.
Ryze
traveled
the
world,
seeking
the
wisdom
of
powerful
hermits,
witches,
and
shamans
-
anyone
who
had
something
to
share
beyond
what
was
taught
in
the
city-states
of
Valoran
.
When
he
had
learned
all
he
could
from
these
fonts
of
wisdom,
Ryze
turned
to
seek
the
lost,
forgotten,
and
forbidden
knowledge
in
the
world,
delving
into
mystical
worlds
where
others
feared
to
tread.
Ryze's
tireless
searching
for
magical
knowledge
led
him
to
an
ancient
form
of
spellcraft
known
as
thorn
magic.
This
art
required
Ryze
to
tattoo
spells
on
his
body,
permanently
infusing
his
being
with
vast
arcane
power
and
finally
fulfilling
his
need
to
bond
with
the
mystical
energies
of
Runeterra.
His
travels
also
led
him
to
uncover
the
giant
indestructible
scroll
he
now
carries
on
his
back
-
the
purpose
of
the
inscribed
spell
remains
a
secret
only
Ryze
knows.
He
claims
it
is
an
abomination
-
something
that
he
must
safeguard
from
the
world.
This
has
piqued
the
curiosity
of
many,
though
no
one
is
sure
how
to
separate
the
scroll
from
Ryze,
or
if
it
is
possible
to
overcome
the
rogue
mage
to
do
so.
Since
then,
Ryze
has
joined
the
League
of
Legends
to
study
the
magical
creatures
and
powerful
will-workers
that
fight
there,
in
order
to
complete
his
exploration
of
mystical
Runeterra.
"Ryze
is
no
longer
just
a
mage
-
he
has
become
a
creature
of
magic
itself."

CLE
OBSERVATION
Ryze
strides
along
the
marbles
halls;
face
deliberate,
jaw
set
and
determined.
His
eyes
hold
a
sense
of
urgency
and
undeniable
purpose
that
is
mirrored
in
his
gait.
His
simple
traveler's
clothes
pose
a
stark
contrast
to
the
elaborate
tattoos
that
snake
their
way
across
his
wiry
frame,
marring
every
inch
of
his
exposed
flesh.
Slung
over
his
powerful
back
hangs
a
scroll;
precious
cargo
from
how
he
cradles
it.
From
the
embossed
spellbook
in
his
grip
to
the
lesser
scraps
of
parchment
at
his
side,
nothing
is
borne
with
more
reverence.
He
stops
for
a
moment
beneath
an
archway
marked
by
a
double
door
and
an
inscription:
"The
truest
opponent
lies
within."
The
Rogue
Mage
extends
a
hand,
parting
the
portal,
before
striding
boldly
inside.
REFLECTION
Ryze
stood
for
a
moment
in
the
dark,
calm
but
alert.
He
sniffed
the
air.
There
was
something
here...
a
tangible
presence.
"A
visitor?"
called
a
voice
from
the
black,
"How
strange.
I
loathe
uninvited
guests!"
Every
muscle
in
his
body
tightened
like
a
coiled
spring.
Out
of
the
darkness
strode
a
lithe,
beautiful
woman,
dressed
in
a
loose
fitting
dress.
From
neck
to
fingertips,
she
was
covered
in
tattoos.
"Lilith?"
he
gasped,
"How
did
you
find
me?"
She
reached
out
a
slender
hand,
lightly
drawing
her
long
nails
down
Ryze's
bare
chest.
"Ryze,"
she
purred,
"You
cannot
hide
from
me."
She
drew
in
closer,
catching
him
in
her
embrace.
"I
have
a
secret,"
she
whispered,
pulling
herself
close
to
his
cheek.
"I
will
never
let
you
go!"
she
snarled,
biting
his
earlobe
suggestively.
He
shivered.
The
pinch
in
his
ear
became
a
sharp
sting.
He
heard
an
impact
and
fell
reeling
to
the
ground,
catching
himself
on
pure,
unmarked
hands.
He
recognized
them
as
his
own,
but
that
was
impossible.
He
hadn't
seen
his
bare
flesh
in
years.
"Trespasser!"
rasped
Lilith's
voice.
"Pardon,
mistress,"
he
started,
climbing
to
his
feet
on
the
ramshackled
porch
of
a
lonely
cabin,
"I
am
weary
and
in
search
of
shelter
for
the
evening.
The
Howling
Marsh
is
no
place
to
be
caught
after
dark."
"I
do
not
shelter
insufferable
wayfarers,"
she
replied,
folding
her
arms
implacably.
A
slight
breeze
caught
her
wild
hair.
Ryze
sneered.
"I
am
not
to
be
trifled
with..."
She
cut
him
off.
"Trifled?!"
she
screeched,
extending
a
finger.
Energy
crackled
along
the
patterns
on
her
arm,
racing
across
the
distance
between
them.
First
it
was
just
the
jolt.
The
breath
rushed
from
his
lungs
and
for
a
moment
he
blacked
out.
The
next
thing
he
knew
he
was
lying
on
his
back
in
the
mud,
gasping.
His
body
tingled,
and
he
shook
from
head
to
foot.
Lilith
stood
over
him,
silhouetted
in
the
setting
sun,
energy
still
coursing
along
the
ink
in
her
tattoos.
"You
will
learn
respect,
vagabond,"
she
said,
even
voiced
once
again.
"Please,
mistress,"
Ryze
gasped,
"spare
my
life."
She
knelt
over
him,
leaning
in
just
inches
from
his
nose,
her
hair
falling
into
his
face.
She
dug
her
fingernails
into
the
shirt
over
his
chest,
"Why,
pretty
thing?
Why
should
I
spare
your
life?"
He
inhaled
sharply
through
the
pain
in
his
chest,
"Because
I
have
been
searching
for
you
for
my
entire
life,"
he
stammered,
"and
it
would
break
my
heart
to
die,
now."
Lilith
sat
up
slightly.
She
smiled.
"How
interesting,"
she
replied.
Ryze's
strength
failed
him
and
he
passed
out.
He
awoke
lying
face
down
on
a
plush
mattress,
arms
and
legs
spread
wide.
He
tried
to
move,
but
found
himself
bound
tightly
in
place.
Next
to
him
on
the
pillow
lay
a
series
of
razor
sharp
thorns
and
a
font
of
violet
liquid.
"Awake
so
soon,"
Lilith
muttered
coyly,
entering
the
room
through
a
beaded
curtain.
She
climbed
onto
the
bed
with
him,
straddling
his
lower
back.
"Tell
me,
wayfarer,"
she
quipped,
reaching
for
her
implements,
"what
is
it
about
me
that
is
so
fascinating?"
She
dipped
a
barb
into
the
inkwell.
"I
have
studied
magic
since
I
was
a
boy,"
Ryze
croaked
into
the
pillow.
He
felt
a
twinge
in
the
nape
of
his
neck
and
he
winced.
"Don’t
squirm!"
Lilith
shouted,
bringing
a
hand
down
hard
on
his
shoulder
with
an
audible
smack.
Ryze
gritted
his
teeth
through
the
pain
and
continued.
The
burning
sensation
spread
as
she
went
about
her
bloody
work.
"Always,
my
masters
taught
me
patience,
to
remain
in
control,
to
never
surrender
to
my
passions,"
she
changed
needles.
He
could
feel
blood
and
ink
pooling
in
his
open
wounds.
"They
called
me
a
liability;
refused
to
finish
training
me,"
he
went
on,
"You
know
another
way."
"Charlatans,"
Lilith
spat,
wiping
the
blood
from
his
back
with
her
dress.
She
bent
low
over
him,
her
hot
breath
on
his
neck.
She
whispered,
"but
we
know
better,
don't
we.
Magic
is
energy.
All
our
enthusiasm;
our
rapture;
our
fury.
They
are
conduits
for
our
power."
She
licked
her
lips.
"I
can
show
you
the
way."
She
freed
his
limbs.
"Now
roll
over,"
she
snapped,
another
needle
clutched
lightly
in
her
fingers,
"I
haven't
finished."
Ryze
grudgingly
obeyed,
though
his
body
throbbed
with
pain.
Above
him
in
the
rafters
hung
an
elaborate
scroll
on
stretched
parchment,
larger
than
a
tapestry.
"What
is
that?"
he
asked,
remembering
himself.
Lilith's
face
grew
ashen.
The
room
around
him
fell
away
to
darkness.
"You
stole
it
from
me!"
she
shrieked,
arms
flailing,
tears
streaming
down
her
face,
"How
could
you?!
Betrayer!
Betrayer!"
She
struck
him
a
dozen
times
before
he
could
restrain
her.
"I
had
no
choice!"
he
cried,
"You
wouldn't
listen!
You
would
bring
ruin
on
us
all!"
Lilith
scoffed.
"Why
do
you
want
to
join
the
League,
Ryze?"
Ryze
released
her
and
she
pulled
away.
He
adjusted
the
scroll
on
his
back.
"I
must
keep
it
safe."
She
smiled.
"How
does
it
feel,
exposing
your
mind?"
Ryze
determined
countenance
returned.
"I
will
do
what
I
must,"
he
replied.
He
raised
a
hand
to
shield
his
face
as
the
doors
to
the
League
of
Legends
swung
open,
and
light
came
pouring
in.
