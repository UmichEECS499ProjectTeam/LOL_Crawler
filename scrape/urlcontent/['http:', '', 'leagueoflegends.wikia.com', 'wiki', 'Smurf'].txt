"Claw
or
spear,
your
end's
the
same."
It
has
been
suggested
that
this
article
or
section
be
merged
with
League_of_Legends_terminology
.
Please

A
smurf
is
a
low-level
account
belonging
to
a
summoner
who
also
has
a
high
level
account,
usually
a
level
30.
The
smurf
account
is
matched
up
with
low
level
players
once
again
because
it
is
a
new
account.
People
will
make
smurf
accounts
for
various
different
reasons,
including:
Trying
non-standard
team
compositions
or
strategies.
Getting
an
easy
win
or
have
fun
because
the
stress
of
being
in
high
level
games
is
lessened.
Demoralizing
lower-level
players
or
increase
feelings
of
power
or
importance.
Creating
a
backup
account
in
case
their
main
account
were
to
get
banned.
Level
30
players
that
want
to
play
with
friends
that
have
just
started
playing
the
game,
without
pulling
them
into
high
level
matches.
Riot
does
not
punish
summoners
who
have
smurf
accounts.
Though
they
might
punish
those
who
refer
their
smurf
accounts
through
the
refer
a
friend
program
on
the
basis
of
fraud.
Another
type
of
smurf
is
an
"elo"
or
League
system
smurf.
This
type
of
player
makes
a
secondary
account
which
they
proceed
to
level
up
to
level
thirty
for
the
purpose
of
playing
ranked.
These
players
are
often:
Low
ranking,
yet
believing
they
deserve
better,
so
they
retry
their
placement
matches.
A
player
who
just
wants
a
second
ranked
account,
whether
high
or
low
elo.
A
player
who
wishes
to
troll
in
ranked
games
without
consequences
to
their
main
account.
Players
who
refers
to
themselves
as
"smurfs"
in
a
ranked
queue
are
claiming
they
are
players
of
higher
skill
level
and
rating
playing
at
a
lower
level.
Often
people
will
say
this
just
to
get
the
role
they
want,
however,
occasionally
actual
smurfs
do
play
in
lower
rated
games
to
relax
or
increase
the
rating
of
their
secondary
account.
