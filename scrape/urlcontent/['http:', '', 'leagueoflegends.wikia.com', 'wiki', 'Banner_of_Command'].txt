the

Notes
The
aura
applies
to
pets
,
but
not
clones
(e.g.
Mordekaiser's
Children
of
the
Grave
).
This
is
one
of
the
two
auras
from
items
that
can
be
used
to
improve
champion
pets,
along
with
the
Captain
boot
enchantment.
In
game
description:
"Nearby

minions

15%
increased
damage."
Contrary
to
the
in-game
description,
Banner
of
Command
does
not
increase
a
minion's
total
damage.
Instead,
it
increases
their
attack
damage
or
ability
power
stats.
As
such,
Banner
Of
Command
only
increases
the
damage
dealt
by
the
minion's
basic
attacks
and
has
no
effect
on
other
damaging
effects
the
pet
has
(such
as
Tibber's
aura).
