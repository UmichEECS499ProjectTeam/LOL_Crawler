Multiple
Guinsoo's
Rageblade
s
will
give
multiple
stacks
for
each
autoattack
and
ability
cast
,
but
a
champion
can
still
only
have
eight
stacks
in
total.
Guinsoo's
Rageblade
's
unique
combination
of
traits
make
it
something
of
a
niche
item
.
It
is
best
on
autoattack-based
champions
who
benefit
from
both
attack
damage
and
ability
power
(
Jax
),
especially
those
who
profit
from
being
low
on
health
(
Aatrox
,
Tryndamere
).
Trivia
Guinsoo's
Rageblade
is
named
after
Steve
"
Guinsoo
"
Feak,
one
of
the
main
creative
minds
behind
League
of
Legends
and
creator
of
DotA
Allstars
.
According
to
Feak,
Guinsoo's
Rageblade
was
created
with
Corki
in
mind.
[2]
It
has
a
similar
icon
to
the
DotA
item
Guinsoo's
Scythe
of
Vyse,
also
named
after
Feak.
Guinsoo's
Rageblade
is
one
of
only
four
items
that
provide
ability
power
alongside
either
attack
damage
or
attack
speed—the
others
being
Hextech
Gunblade
,
Nashor's
Tooth
,
and
Trinity
Force
.
Guinsoo's
Rageblade
was
one
of
the
last
items
released
before
the
launch
of
League
of
Legends
itself.
The
icon
for
the
unique
passive's
buff
is
the
same
as
that
of
the
removed
summoner
spell
Surge
.
Additionally,
the
two
share
the
same
visual
and
audio
effects.
There
once
existed
a
bug
that
enabled
Sion
to
attain
negative
ability
power
and
maximum
attack
speed
with
Guinsoo's
Rageblade
alone.
[3]
When
fully
stacked,
and
it's
secondary
(surge)
passive
activated,
Guinsoo's
Rageblade
gives
the
third
highest
attack
speed
bonus
(52%)
in
the
game
of
all
Items,
behind
Sword
of
the
Divine
(100%
when
activated)
and
Runaan's
Hurricane
(70%).
