Strategy
Morellonomicon
is
an
inexpensive
item
with
an
easy
build
path
that
offers
a
handful
of
useful
stats
early
on.
Due
to
its
substantial
ability
power
and
cooldown
reduction
,
it
is
often
"rushed"
by
casters
with
short
cooldowns,
like
Karma
,
Lux
,
and
Xerath
.
It
is
also
a
cheap
counter
to
champions
who
rely
on
health
regeneration
,
such
as
Aatrox
,
Dr.
Mundo
,
Sion
,
Swain
,
and
Vladimir
.
Some
players
may
desire
more
mana
regeneration
than
Morellonomicon
provides,
typically
when
playing
as
mana-dependent
champions
like
Anivia
,
Swain
,
and
(in
some
cases)
Viktor
.
These
players
usually
purchase
Athene's
Unholy
Grail
instead,
trading
some
ability
power
for
greater
mana
sustain
and
some
magic
resist
.
Notes
Morellonomicon's
passive
applies
to
all
magic
damage
,
including
magic
damage
from
on-hit
effects
.
Trivia
This
item
is
named
after
Ryan
"Morello"
Scott
,
the
Lead
Champion
Designer
at
Riot
Games
.
The
item
was
previously
called
Morello's
Evil
Tome
.
It
was
renamed
to
Morellonomicon
in
Season
Three
as
a
reference
to
both
Morello
and
the
Necronomicon
,
the
fictional
"Book
of
the
Dead".
