(the
9th
point
goes
to
that

Strategy
This
mastery
works
well
on
jungling
champions,
as
they
often
receive
neutral
buffs
to
aid
their
jungling
and
ganking
ability.
Champions
who
rely
heavily
on
the
Crest
of
the
Ancient
Golem
buff
benefit
greatly
from
this
mastery,
as
it
increases
the
duration
of
mana
regeneration
.
