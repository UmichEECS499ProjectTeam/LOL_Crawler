Items
Runaan's
Hurricane
Notes
Cleave
has
a
radius
of
~385;
Crescent
has
a
radius
of
400.
[2]
Cleave
is
centered
on
the
target;
Crescent
is
centered
on
the
user.
Activating
Crescent
does
not
reset
the
auto-attack
timer.
Rather,
the
effect
uses
the
champion's
auto
attack
animation
to
display
the
effect.
Crescent
casts
faster
as
you
gain
more
attack
speed.
This
item
shares
the
Cleave
and
Crescent
effects
with
Tiamat
.
This
item's
passive
and
active
cannot
be
used
by
ranged
champions.
Shapeshifting
champions
can
only
use
Cleave
and
Crescent
while
classified
as
melee.
This
includes
Kayle
,
who
is
considered
a
ranged
champion
while
Righteous
Fury
is
active,
Nidalee
when
using
Aspect
of
the
Cougar
,
Jayce
while
in
Hammer
stance
,
Elise
while
in
Spider
Form
,
and
Quinn
while
her
ultimate
Tag
Team
is
activated.
Cleave's
damage
is
based
on
the
attack
damage
champion
statistic
,
not
from
actual
damage
dealt
on
the
attack—it
therefore
doesn't
benefit
from
critical
strikes
or
on-hit
effects
Cleave's
damage
does
not
trigger
on-hit
effects
,
except
for
life
steal
.
Cleave's
and
Crescent's
damage
procs
The
Black
Cleaver's
passive
effect,
which
is
not
an
on-hit.
Similar
to
how
spell
vamp
interacts
with
area-of-effect,
this
item
currently
applies
only
half
your
life
steal.
[3]
Cleave
will
not
trigger
if
it
has
triggered
on
a
different
target
in
the
last
0.
05
seconds.
[4]
This
affects
abilities
such
as
Shyvana's
Twin
Bite
(Dragon
form).
There
is
no
cooldown
on
triggering
the
effect
on
a
single
target,
such
as
Double
Strike
or
Shyvana's
Twin
Bite
(Human
Form).
Parrrley
procs
Ravenous
Hydra
as
well
as
Tiamat
despite
the
fact
that
the
ability
has
a
range.
Using
Gangplank's
Parrrley
with
Ravenous
Hydra
will
give
you
extra
gold
for
every
single
minion
killed
with
Ravenous
Hydra's
passive
effect.
Trivia
Searching
for
"no
damage"
in
the
shop
will
bring
up
Ravenous
Hydra.
It
is
unknown
if
this
is
a
bug
or
intended
(it
is
possibly
due
to
the
item's
active
is
limited
to
the
attack
damage
of
the
champion
thus
deals
"no
damage"
until
it
is
owned
by
a
champion.)
*Mystery
solved*
It
is
because
of
the
no
in
Ravenous
and
the
damage
listed
in
the
description
