Notes
By
itself,
Seraph's
Embrace
grants
90
AP.
If
you
own
both
Archangel's
Staff
and
Manamune
before
reaching
750
bonus
mana,
Archangel's
Staff
takes
priority
and
will
transform
into
Seraph's
Embrace
.
The
transformation
drains
Mana
Charge
on
other
sources,
but
it
can
be
recharged
again.
The
transformation
passive
is
not
unique,
and
you
can
have
multiple
Seraph's
Embrace
s.
To
work
out
whether
this
item
or
a
Rabadon's
Deathcap
would
grant
you
more
AP,
you
need
to
look
at
your
AP
and
mana
stats
prior
to
the
purchase.
Both
give
the
same
AP
when
0.25AP
+
150
=
0.03(Mana
+
1,000)
+
60.
(This
is
assuming
that
the
Rabadon's
Deathcap
would
be
your
first,
and
that
you
would
thus
be
getting
the
extra
benefit
from
the
unique
passive.)
In
other
words,
for
the
Seraph's
Embrace
to
give
more
AP,
your
mana
prior
to
building
it
must
be
at
least
8.3...AP
+
2,000.
This
means
that,
purely
from
an
AP
perspective,
the
first
Rabadon's
Deathcap
is
almost
always
preferable.
Take
the
case
of
Janna
,
the
champion
with
the
highest
base
mana
in
the
game.
A
decent
build
for
maxmizing
her
AP
without
getting
particularly
ridiculous
includes
the
Rod
of
Ages
,
the
Mejai's
Soulstealer
and
the
Deathfire
Grasp
.
These
alone
give
her
540AP
(with
10
stacks
on
the
Rod
of
Ages
and
20
stacks
on
the
Mejai's
Soulstealer),
meaning
she
needs
4,500
mana
for
the
Seraph's
Embrace
to
give
her
more
AP
than
the
Rabadon's
Deathcap
.
Her
base
mana
at
level
18
is
1,454;
the
Rod
of
Ages
gives
her
another
650
mana,
for
a
total
of
2,104.
This
total
is
far
short
of
the
total
she
needs
for
the
Seraph's
Embrace
to
grant
more
AP.
Manaless
champions
may
charge
the
Tear
of
the
Goddess
,
Manamune
and
Archangel's
Staff
to
get
Muramana
and
Seraph's
Embrace
.
However,
they
won't
get
any
bonuses
of
Muramana
's
Awe
and
toggle,
as
well
as
Seraph's
Embrace
's
Insight
,
and
the
Mana
Shield
grants
only
the
base
150
shield
with
no
bonuses.
With
the
passive
of
this
item,
each
100
gold
spent
on
mana
at
base
efficiency
will
grant
additional
ability
power
worth
32.625
gold.
