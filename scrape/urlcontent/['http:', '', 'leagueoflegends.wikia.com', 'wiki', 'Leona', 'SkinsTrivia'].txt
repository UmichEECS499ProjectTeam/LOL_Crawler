Trivia
Leona
was
designed
by
Volty
.
Leona
was
a
direct
response
to
fan
requests
for
a
female
tank.
Leona
is
voiced
by
Wendee
Lee
.
Leona's
name
is
Latin
for
lioness.
Leon
means
Lion
in
French,
Greek,
Latin
and
Spanish
as
well.
Leona's
appearance
and
personality
are
heavily
inspired
by
IronStylus
'
wife;
her
face
was
drawn
with
Natalie
Portman
as
a
reference.
[1]
Leona's
final
Splash
Art
differs
from
that
of
her
Art
Spotlight
with
the
main
difference
being
her
hair.
As
a
"Chosen
of
the
Sun",
and
with
sun-based
powers,
Leona
may
be
a
reference
to
the
Solar
Exalted
from
the
Tabletop
RPG
Exalted
.
Leona's
dance
is
similar
to
the
Force-Shielder
Class
skill
called
"Shield
Break"
from
Cabal
Online
.
Leona's
passive,
Sunlight
,
is
similar
to
Lux's
Illumination
.
The
two
differences
are
that
Leona
herself
is
unable
to
activate
the
mark
while
only
Lux
can
activate
Illumination,
and
that
any
damage
from
an
ally
can
trigger
Sunlight,
while
Lux
can
only
trigger
Illumination
with
an
autoattack
and
her
ultimate,
Final
Spark
.
Since
Pantheon's
and
her
place
of
origin
is
based
off
of
Ancient
Greece
,
the
Vergina
Sun
,
a
symbol
unearthed
in
Ancient
Macedonia
may
be
the
reason
why
her
theme
is
the
sun.
In
her
work
in
progress
poster,
her
shield
has
the
complete
Vergina
Sun
symbol
with
all
16
points,
whereas
in
the
classic
skin,
the
Vergina
Symbol
on
her
shield
appears
to
not
have
spikes
on
its
bottom
half.
It
still
has
all
16
points
but
5
of
which
are
attached
to
the
shield
itself
and
not
on
the
Vergina
Symbol.
Leona
has
a
hidden
passive
that
causes
Sunlight
to
deal
1
less
damage
to
champions
with
sunglasses.
[2]
This
includes
champions
such
as
Vayne
and
skins
such
as
Surfer
Singed
and
Riot
Graves
.
Leona's
Zenith
Blade
was
chosen
by
community
to
be
forged
by
Man
at
Arms.
Here
you
can
watch
the
episode
about
making
it.
Skins
Valkyrie
Leona
is
based
off
the
valkyries
,
a
host
of
female
figures
from
Norse
mythology
who
wander
the
battle
fields
retrieving
slain
warriors
who
are
to
be
brought
to
Valhalla
after
a
glorious
death
in
battle.
This
is
fitting
as
a
skin
for
a
true
tank,
who
can
to
an
extent
decide
who
dies
in
battle
by
stunning
key
enemies
and
saving
allies.
Leona's
dress
appears
to
become
see
through,
showing
her
undergarments
while
hiding
in
the
bushes
in
her
Valkyrie
skin
-
this
is
an
unintentional
graphical
error.
This
due
to
the
fact
that
the
model
has
several
layers
and
entering
a
brush
causes
the
outer
layer
to
become
transparent.
Iron
Solari
Leona
skin
is
based
on
Locket
of
the
Iron
Solari
.
It
has
different
spell
effects
for
three
of
her
spells:
Zenith
Blade
sprouts
phoenix
wings
during
its
trajectory.
Solar
Flare
leaves
an
imprint
of
the
Iron
Solari
upon
impact.
The
Lunari
insignia
on
her
Pool
Party
skin
Eclipse
makes
the
phoenix
of
her
shield
to
open
its
wings
trying
to
cover
Leona's
head.
The
splash
art
has
some
ties
to
IronStylus
,
an
avid
Leona
fan.
The
overall
avian
theme
to
the
skin
and
the
scarlet
macaws
flying
in
the
background
pay
tribute
to
IronStylus;
he
uses
one
of
those
birds
as
his
avatar
on
the
forums
and
he
is
a
proud
owner
of
similar
birds.
The
name
of
the
skin
shares
its
initials
with
his
pseudonym.
Pool
Party
Leona
In
the
Pool
Party
Leona
artwork,
you
can
see
Taric
skipping
with
Lux
while
Ezreal
looks
on
with
a
jealous
expression
and
bad
tan
and
Nami
swimming.
This
is
poking
fun
at
the
rumors
of
Ezreal's
love
interest.
Some
official
sources
point
at
Lux,
while
some
people
in
the
fandom
joke
about
a
possible
Taric/Ezreal
relationship.
Pool
Party
Leona
has
a
hidden
Lunari
symbol
at
the
bottom
right
of
the
back
of
her
shield/surfboard.
Pool
Party
Leona
was
proposed
by
the
community
[3]
[4]
[5]
Lore
Relations
Leona
was
childhood
friends
with
Pantheon
.
Leona
and
Diana
are
adversaries,
with
Diana
being
the
"Chosen
of
the
Moon"
and
Leona
being
the
"Chosen
of
the
Sun".
The
"Chosen
of
the
Moon"
and
the
"Chosen
of
the
Sun"
depicted
in
the
mural
are
not
Diana
and
Leona,
but
their
ancient
predecessors.
A
post
by
IronStylus
in
the
thread
Diana's
lore
,
Diana
and
Leona
may
share
a
bond
between
one
another
as
more
then
the
"Chosen
of
the
Moon"
and
the
"Chosen
of
the
Sun".
This
can
only
be
implied
by
the
quote
"We
want
them
to
be
intertwined,
and
without
delving
too
far
into
assumptions
and
implications,
without
getting
too
detailed
about
their
past
relationship,
what
is
more
tragic
than
to
have
to
kill
someone
that
you
love?".
