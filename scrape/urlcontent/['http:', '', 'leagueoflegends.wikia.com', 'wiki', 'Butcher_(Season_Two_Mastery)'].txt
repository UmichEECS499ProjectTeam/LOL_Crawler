The
subject
of
this
article
was
removed
from
League

Legends
in
patch
V1.0.0.152
.
The
information
displayed
is
no
longer
relevant
to
League
of
Legends,
but
exists
here
for
historical
purposes.

Butcher
is
a
first
tier
offense
mastery
with
2
ranks.

Effect
per
rank
Increases
the
damage
you
deal
to
minions
and
monsters
by
2
/
4.
Requirements
None.
Strategy
The
damage
is
an
on-hit
effect
and
only
applies
to
auto-attacks
and
abilities
that
apply
on-hit
effects,
such
as
Ezreal's
Mystic
Shot
and
Nasus's
Siphoning
Strike
.
An
extra
4
damage
on
every
hit
is
significant
to
minions
and
monsters
,
but
remember
that
it
has
no
effect
whatsoever
on
champions
.
This
mastery
can
be
useful
for
last
hitting
minions
at
low
levels
where
an
extra
4
damage
is
a
large
increase
compared
to
many
champions'
base
AD
,
and
may
net
you
some
extra
gold
in
the
laning
phase.
