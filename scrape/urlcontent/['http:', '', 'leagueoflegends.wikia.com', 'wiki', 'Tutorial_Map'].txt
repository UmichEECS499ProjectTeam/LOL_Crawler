The
subject
of
this
article
was
removed
from
League
of
Legends
.
The
information
displayed
is
no
longer
relevant
to
League
of
Legends,
but
exists
here
for
historical
purposes.
Map
of
the
tutorial
Proving
Grounds
The
Proving
Grounds
was
a
basic
map
for
teaching
new
players
the
gameplay
mechanics
and
basic
concepts
of
the
game
such
as
using
abilities
and
what
turrets
are.
The
Proving
Grounds
was
re-released
as
a
single
lane,
5v5
map
available
through
custom
matches
for
the
sake
of
All-Random
All-Middle
(ARAM)
games
in
patch
V1.0.0.141
.
This
had
no
effect
on
the
tutorial.
The
Proving
Grounds
was
replaced
with
the
new
"
Howling
Abyss
"
in
Patch
v3.6
.

Development
Tutorial
Version
In
the
words
of
Marc
Merrill
:
We're
writing
a
tutorial,
which
is
another
very
highly
requested
feature
by
a
lot
of
users,
especially
the
newer
guys,
obviously,
who
haven't
experienced
games
like
DotA
before.
[1]
The
Proving
Grounds
is
available
from
the
Play
Button
in
the
main
menu
of
the
PVP.net
client,
by
selecting
the
Tutorial
button.
In
the
Tutorial
Map
the
player
controls
Ashe
and
the
abilities
are
limited
only
to
Volley
and
Summoner's
Heal
.
The
only
item
that
is
available
for
purchase
is
Thornmail
.
You
are
facing
an
enemy
Master
Yi
who
can
never
kill
you
because
you
have
Thornmail
,
due
to
the
fact
that
Thornmail
calculates
the
damage
returned
before
resistances
(see
Trivia
on
why
you
cannot
die).
Custom
Version
Map
of
the
ARAM
Proving
Grounds
Testing
of
the
Custom
Version
of
the
map
started
on
the
PBE
on
June
9th,
2012
following
Brackhar
's
forum
announcement:
Hey
Dudes!
A
little
over
a
month
ago,
a
number
of
developers
and
I
participated
in
Riot’s
first
ever
Thunderdome
–
a
periodic,
companywide
event
aimed
at
allowing
developers
to
work
on
whatever
they
want.
My
team
set
out
to
make
the
Proving
Grounds,
our
basic
tutorial
map,
playable
as
full
on
5v5.
This
is
something
I’ve
wanted
to
do
ever
since
I
originally
worked
on
the
map,
and
with
the
help
of
some
other
devs
(and
a
good
bit
of
caffeine)
we
managed
to
get
everything
up
and
running.
Everyone
was
pretty
happy
with
how
the
effort
turned
out,
and
with
the
upcoming
removal
of
Winter
Summoner’s
Rift
we
saw
an
opportunity
to
sneak
the
new
map
out
by
repurposing
the
same
UI
hooks.
In
the
next
patch,
the
Proving
Grounds
map
will
be
selectable
in
custom
games.
While
we’ve
been
playtesting
it
internally
as
All
Random
(and
lovin’
it)
for
quite
some
time
now,
all
the
pick
options
will
be
available
–
Blind
Pick,
Draft,
and
All
Random
–
because
we’re
excited
to
see
what
variation
you
enjoy
the
most.
We’d
love
to
hear
any
feedback
that
you
may
have,
as
both
RiotNome
and
myself
will
be
providing
support
post
release.
Check
it
out
and
let
us
know
what
you
think!

Trivia
The
Proving
Grounds
is
referenced
in
Vi's
login
theme.
In
response
to
a
summoner's
question
about
what
happened
to
the
Proving
Grounds
prior
to
the
release
of
the
Howling
Abyss
,
Brackhar
said
that
the
Proving
Grounds
crumbled
due
to
the
many
battles
fought
on
it.
Tutorial
Version
Although
the
tutorial
has
you
with
the
summoner
spell
Revive
,
you
cannot
be
killed.
The
lower
your
health
is,
the
less
damage
enemies
deal.
Custom
Version
The
custom
game
version
of
the
Proving
Grounds
has
slightly
different
mechanics
to
its
tutorial
counterpart
and
Summoner's
Rift,
incorporating
some
features
previously
exclusive
to
the
Dominion
game
type:
Players
receive
a
constant
stream
of
experience
and
accelerated
gold
income.
Health
relics
are
located
at
points
along
the
lane.
Exiting
the
team's
base
immediately
locks
the
shop
from
use.
Players
may
only
use
the
shop
again
if
they
die.
Recall
is
disabled.
The
fountain
does
not
regenerate
health,
mana,
or
energy.
