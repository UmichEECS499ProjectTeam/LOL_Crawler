Ahri's
Essence
Theft
grants
Ahri
high
sustain
but
is
subject
to
mana
constraints.
The
healing
potential
granted
by
Essence
Theft
is
at
its
best
when
used
with
Orb
of
Deception
,
as
it
can
hit
the
largest
number
of
targets.
Ahri
can
use
Essence
Theft
to
check
bushes
and
fog
of
war,
when
she
casts
a
spell,
if
it
hits,
it
will
grant
a
stack
on
her
passive
or
heal
her
if
it
is
fully
stacked,
keep
this
in
mind
when
playing.
Orb
of
Deception
is
a
boomerang
skillshot
,
meaning
you
can
move
after
casting
and
it
will
change
the
path
of
the
orb
as
it
comes
back.
Spirit
Rush
can
be
used
to
help
you
to
lead
the
orb's
return
in
hectic
teamfights;
but
don't
waste
the
ultimate
simply
for
this
purpose
unless
it's
absolutely
necessary,
as
the
damage
from
any
single
strike
of
the
orb
is
low.
Do
not
be
deceived
by
the
low
damage
quoted
for
Orb
of
Deception
-
over
repeated
applications,
the
orb
deals
surprisingly
high
damage
because
half
of
it
deals
true
damage.
It
is
best
used
when
your
opponent
is
walking
directly
towards
or
away
from
you,
is
standing
still,
or
is
at
the
maximum
range
of
the
spell.
Orb
of
Deception
grants
exceptional
waveclear
-
the
ability
to
weaken
or
destroy
large
waves
of
minions
in
a
single
spell
-
if
you
learn
to
hit
almost
every
minion
in
a
wave
with
it,
which
can
be
done
fairly
easily
with
practice.
Ahri
can
beat
many
champions
that
she
can't
in
spell
matchups
alone
by
pushing
large
groups
of
minions
at
them.
Consider
leveling
Orb
of
Deception
and
Fox-Fire
over
Charm
;
this
will
make
you
a
primary
source
of
damage
mid-game,
although
the
lower
CC
time
is
a
noticeable
loss.
You
can
aim
Ahri's
Orb
of
Deception
and
Charm
and
activate
Fox-Fire
while
in
the
air
after
using
Spirit
Rush
;
she
will
cast
the
spell
after
the
dash.
Charm
,
of
all
Ahri's
abilities,
is
the
most
versatile,
useful,
and
able
to
turn
the
tide
of
the
game
in
a
single
play.
It
is
one
of
the
most
devastating
stuns
in
the
game
to
be
hit
with,
for
it
forces
a
champion
not
just
to
be
stunned
but
to
walk
forward
out
of
safety
or
cover
as
well.
However,
it
is
a
difficult
skillshot
to
connect
with.
Initiating
with
Charm
will
allow
you
to
maximize
your
damage,
as
the
target
will
be
unable
to
dodge
Orb
of
Deception
and
they
will
take
the
brunt
of
Fox-Fire's
damage,
all
of
which
is
amplified
by
20%.
In
teamfights,
use
Charm
to
divide
up
the
enemy
team.
Outflank
the
enemy
and
pull
a
member
of
the
team
to
the
side,
or
use
it
to
pull
a
powerful
enemy
champion
off
a
squishy
teammate.
Charm
can
slow
enemy
champions
who
are
chasing
you.
Ahri
is
notorious
as
a
champion
who
punishes
chasing
opponents,
hitting
them
with
Orb
of
Deception
Fox-Fire
repeatedly
while
they
are
charmed,
charming
them
into
turrets
and
teamganks,
et
cetera.
It's
also
just
as
useful
for
enemies
who
are
trying
to
flee!
Charm
is
also
exceptional
at
checking
bushes
for
ganks.
Cast
Charm
at
a
brush
and
listen
for
the
hit
/
watch
if
it
stops
early.
It
is
better
to
waste
mana
and
no-one
be
there
rather
than
to
save
the
cost
of
the
spell
and
be
ganked.
If
you
hit
an
enemy
with
Charm
and
then
leave
its
area
of
vision,
for
example,
by
walking
into
a
brush
,
it
will
no
longer
follow
you
until
you
get
into
its
sight
again.
The
slow
persists
in
any
case.
Due
to
the
relatively
slow
projectile
speed
of
Charm
it
can
easily
be
dodged
if
the
enemy
champion
is
expecting
it.
To
regain
the
element
of
surprise,
get
into
range
but
lead
with
a
Spirit
Rush
or
Flash
and
immediately
follow
with
your
combo.
This
both
catches
them
off-guard,
and
reduces
the
distance
your
skillshots
have
to
travel,
thus
reducing
the
time
they
have
to
react.
Using
Spirit
Rush
all
at
once
may
not
be
the
smartest
choice
in
a
fight.
Try
saving
them
using
them
to
position
yourself
for
your
skillshots,
chase
down
stragglers,
run
away,
or
to
turn
the
fight
with
another
quick
burst
to
the
right
champions.
In
the
early
game,
Spirit
Rush
is
great
for
finishing
off
running
champions
as
you
can
usually
turret
dive
safely
since
the
skill
can
be
used
three
times
before
going
on
cooldown.
However,
it
is
best
to
save
the
last
Spirit
Rush
for
escaping
from
turret
range
if
it
is
used
for
turret
diving.
If
you've
only
just
gotten
your
ultimate,
this
is
essential,
as
turrets
will
generally
kill
you
in
two
to
three
shots
at
level
6.
Many
players
see
only
the
offensive
potential
of
Spirit
Rush
,
but
it
is
even
better
as
an
escape
tool.
Don't
be
afraid
to
use
it
to
save
yourself.
In
particular,
learn
how
to
Spirit
Rush
through
thin
walls
-
ranked
play
requires
the
ability
to
escape
through
several
walls,
or
chase
a
badly
wounded
enemy
through
several
walls,
and
never
miss
a
gap
closer.
Though
Spirit
Rush
itself
is
only
one
spell,
each
dash
will
reset
the
cap
of
Essence
Theft
,
making
it
possible
to
gain
up
to
9
charges
with
it
when
used
in
teamfights
or
against
minions.
Spirit
Rush's
cooldown
is
fairly
reasonable,
and
will
be
available
in
most
team
fights.
When
in
doubt,
use
it,
and
if
you've
made
a
mistake,
use
the
other
dashes
to
retreat
backwards.
Orb
of
Deception
,
Charm
and
especially
Fox-Fire
are
really
good
at
kiting
enemies
and
whittling
away
at
their
health;
this
is
the
basic
nature
of
play
with
Ahri
.
Many
mages
are
easily
slain
if
caught
by
fighters
at
too
short
a
distance,
but
Charm
and
Spirit
Rush
make
Ahri
dangerous
to
any
champion
she
catches
off
guard,
as
well
as
easily
able
to
escape
danger.
She
plays
most
like
a
magical
version
of
Akali
,
with
both
champions'
ultimates
allowing
them
to
chase
fleeing
opponents
or
run
away
from
unfavorable
engagements
easily.
The
challenge
is
the
highly
technical
nature
of
her
play,
as
she
has
two
skillshot
abilities
that
must
connect
repeatedly
and
in
tandem
for
her
to
be
effective.
Item
usage
Ahri
's
damage
is
benefited
greatly
by
her
getting
close
to
her
enemies.
This
is
why
it
is
recommended
that
you
build
items
that
give
a
mix
of
both
ability
power
damage
and
survivability.
Spell
vamp
and
Movement
speed
are
often
her
best
ways
to
survive,
as
she
is
not
especially
tanky
even
with
high
armor.
She
also
burns
mana
at
incredible
rates
thanks
to
her
damaging
and
low-cooldown
spells,
so
Mana
regeneration
is
another
important
stat
for
her.
For
rare
games
where
your
Spirit
Rush
isn't
enough
to
keep
you
safe,
the
Spectre's
Cowl
-
Spirit
Visage
build
path
grants
exceptional
magic
resist
against
poke
abilities
even
longer
than
your
own,
as
well
as
cooldown
reduction
and
lots
of
help
with
health.
Boots
help
early
with
Ahri
because
her
default
movespeed
is
slow.
You
won't
get
your
ultimate
until
level
6,
and
even
after
you
have
it,
you
won't
always
want
to
waste
it
chasing
down
enemies.
Boots
of
Swiftness,
Ionian
Boots
of
Lucidity,
Mercury's
Treads,
Sorcerer's
Shoes,
or
Boots
of
Mobility
are
all
viable
boot
choices
depending
on
the
game.
Good
initial
purchases
include
Sight
Ward
(s),
Mana
Potion
(s),
Faerie
Charm
(s),
an
Amplifying
Tome
or
a
Doran's
Ring
;
depending
on
the
champion
makeup
you
face
or
are
laning
with.
Top
players
often
take
a
Crystalline
Flask
to
mitigate
her
early
squishiness
and
provide
sustainable
health
and
mana.
One
way
or
another,
Ahri
is
mana-intensive;
so
try
to
take
either
Crystalline
Flask
,
several
Mana
Potion
,
or
a
Faerie
Charm
with
you
to
lane.
Spell
vamp
is
usually
a
crucial
stat,
increasing
her
already
high
sustainability
and
making
it
possible
to
better
survive
a
fight.
Hextech
Revolver
is
a
good
choice
for
Ahri
,
and
can
be
built
into
Will
of
the
Ancients
.
Will
of
the
Ancients
is
a
great
Spell
vamp
choice
,
granting
10%
CDR,
moderate
(50)
AP,
and
MP5
at
a
low
cost
of
only
2000g.
Ability
power
is
also
a
must
for
Ahri
.
As
a
fragile
mage
that
needs
to
get
close
to
output
her
maximum
damage,
a
health-granting
AP
item
such
as
Rod
of
Ages
or
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
may
be
a
good
pick-up.
Note
that
Fox-Fire
and
Spirit
Rush
proc
the
single-target
slow
on
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
,
making
it
a
great
item
for
kiting
and
durability.
Don't
be
fooled
by
Ahri
's
deceptively
low
ratios.
Rabadon's
Deathcap
will
increase
your
damage
output
considerably,
as
Fox-Fire
damage
can
go
up
to
a
1.2
AP
ratio
if
hitting
several
targets
and
a
1.05
AP
ratio
to
up
to
three
targets
with
Spirit
Rush
.
Ahri
is
very
often
the
initiator
for
teamfights
using
Spirit
Rush
and
Charm
;
Zhonya's
Hourglass
can
protect
you
from
an
initiation
gone
wrong
by
allowing
her
to
turn
to
a
statue
while
also
giving
a
great
deal
of
ability
power
damage.
Deathfire
Grasp
is
a
common
buy
on
Ahri
because
the
percent
damage
nuke
and
increased
spell
damage
lets
her
destroy
one
target
Abyssal
Scepter
helps
Ahri
greatly
as
she
will
be
close
to
the
enemy
team
in
many
fights.
However,
it
may
be
inconsistent
at
max
range
since
the
range
on
the
Abyssal
Scepter's
aura
is
700
ands
most
of
her
spell
ranges
exceed
that.
Since
Spirit
Rush's
Essence
Bolt
range
is
the
same
as
Ahri's
auto-attack
range,
she
can
deal
more
damage
by
dashing
towards
an
enemy
and
immediately
auto-attacking.

All

spells
can

with
proper
positioning
or

.
Her
Orb
of
Deception
and
Charm
spells
are
line
skill
shots
that
move
fairly
slowly
so
you
can
step
to
the
side
to
avoid
them.
Her
Fox-Fire
and
Spirit
Rush
spells
target
the
3
closest
enemy
targets,
but
do
prioritize
champions
in
a
smaller
range,
staying
behind
minions,
tanks,
or
your
team
can
help
you
avoid
some
or
all
of
the
damage
or
make
Ahri
risk
putting
herself
in
a
bad
position
if
she
wants
to
damage
you
with
them.
Don't
chase
Ahri
without
a
very
good
reason!
All
three
of
Fox-Fire
's
attacks
will
hit
you
if
you're
the
closest
thing
to
her,
and
as
soon
as
you're
low
on
health,
she'll
Charm
and
kill
you.
Wait
until
Ahri
is
low
on
health
or
mana
or
vulnerable,
or
until
you
know
Charm
and
Fox-Fire
are
on
cooldown,
before
chasing
her.
Buying
health
can
help
you
to
survive
against
her
true
damage.
Always
remember
to
move
away
from
her
Orb
of
Deception
path
after
she
uses
the
spell
as
the
orb
will
return
to
her
and
deals
true
damage
to
you.
Take
cover
behind
minions
when
engaging
her
in
order
to
avoid
her
Charm
.
When
Ahri
uses
her
Fox-Fire
,
take
cover
behind
minions
so
the
spell
will
only
hit
you
once.
Ahri
is
very
vulnerable
when
her
Spirit
Rush
is
on
cooldown.
Try
to
engage
her
when
you
think
her
Spirit
Rush
is
on
cooldown.
If
fed,
Ahri
has
one
of
the
strongest
mid
games
in
the
game,
and
Charm
remains
dangerous
until
the
end
of
the
game.
Avoid
giving
her
kills
to
snowball.
Ahri's
mobility
is
one
of
her
greatest
strengths,
so
a
combination
of
crowd
control
like
stuns
and
slows
will
lower
her
utility.
When
laning
with
a
partner
against
Ahri
,
be
sure
to
remember
not
to
activate
any
movement
speed
boost
abilities
or
item
effects
if
a
partner
is
affected
by
Charm
.
A
strong
counter-pick
to
an
Ahri
is
someone
with
a
snare,
such
as
Ryze
,
as
his
Rune
Prison
is
able
to
lock
her
out
of
Spirit
Rush
without
much
difficulty,
or
Veigar's
Event
Horizon
can
stop
Ahri
if
she
turns
up
the
attack,
and
his
Primordial
Burst
can
instantly
decimate
her
if
she
has
high
AP.
