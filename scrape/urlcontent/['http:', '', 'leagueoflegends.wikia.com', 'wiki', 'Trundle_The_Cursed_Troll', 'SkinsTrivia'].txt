Trivia
Trundle
was
designed
by
Geeves
.
Trundle
is
voiced
by
Joshua
Tomar
Trundle's
champion
title
was
previously
"the
Cursed
Troll"
but
with
the
Freljord
patch
his
background
story
got
changed
and
is
now
known
as
"the
Troll
King".
Trundle
is
the
first
champion
to
cost
4800
.
Trundle's
hair
resembles
the
Troll
doll's
hair.
Trundle's
recall
animation
is
the
famous
"Winter
is
Coming"
pose
from
the
series
of
books
Game
of
Thrones
.
Definition
of
the
verb
"to
trundle"
is
"to
move
along
by
or
as
if
by
rolling";
or
rather,
"to
roll",
sounding
similarly
to
his
species
as
a
"troll".
The
area
for
Frozen
Domain
is
currently,
not
counting
global
abilities,
the
largest
AoE
in
the
game.
Since
his
introduction,
Trundle
went
nearly
two
years
before
being
subject
to
balance
changes
to
any
of
his
skills
or
stats.
He
was
finally
given
changes
in
the
Shadow
Isles
patch
in
late
October
2012.
Trundle
received
a
visual
upgrade
across
all
skins
including
a
new
Classic
skin
.
His
existing,
although
upgraded
classic
skin
was
made
available
in
the
store
for
two
weeks
before
being
retired
into
the
Legacy
Vault.
Players
who
owned
Trundle
before
his
rework
received
Traditional
Trundle
for
free.
His
new
model
has
been
revealed,
along
with
a
teaser/concept
piece
in
the
form
of
sketch
made
by
Quinn
during
her
exploration
of
Freljord
.
His
new
classic
skin
and
lore
tie
him
in
with
Freljord.
Trundle
is
one
of
four
champions
to
feature
a
Traditional
skin
that
represents
them
as
they
were
prior
to
an
extensive
rework,
along
with
Traditional
Karma
,
Traditional
Sejuani
and
Traditional
Lee
Sin
.
The
number
86
on
the
back
of
the
shirt
of
Lil'
Slugger
Trundle
represents
the
birth
year
of
cgsammu,
the
3D
character
artist
who
worked
on
it.

Quotes
Trundle's
line
"The
Trolls
are
going
to
war"
may
be
a
direct
reference
to
a
quote
by
Treebeard
in
The
Lord
of
the
Rings:
The
Two
Towers
:
"The
Ents
are
going
to
war
".
Trundle's
taunt
to
Leona
"Sunlight?
Really?"
is
most
likely
a
reference
to
trolls
turning
to
stone
when
sunlight
shines
upon
them
in
certain
legends
and
fantasy
universes
(
"The
Hobbit"
being
a
notable
example).
Traditional
Trundle's
quotes
make
several
references
to
internet
"trolls",
a
derogatory
term
for
someone
who
intentionally
annoys
or
offends
another
person.
Traditional
Trundle's
"Don't
hate
the
player,
hate
the
club
that's
smashing
your
face!"
could
be
also
a
reference
to
that
meme.
It
could
be
also
a
joke
from
Riot
implying
that
players
focus
their
hate
on
champions,
not
on
their
player,
calling
for
nerfs
on
the
forums.
Traditional
Trundle's
first
joke,
"How
much
you
wanna
bet
I
can
whack
you
from
one
fountain
to
the
other?",
is
most
likely
a
reference
to
the
movie
Napoleon
Dynamite
,
in
which
the
character
Uncle
Rico
at
one
point
asks,
"
How
much
you
wanna
make
a
bet
I
can
throw
a
football
over
them
mountains",
while
reminiscing
of
his
past
in
football.
Trundle's
dance
is
a
reference
to
Dancing
Troll.
Relations
Trundle
is
currently
in
an
alliance
with
Lissandra
.
His
club,
Boneshiver,
belonged
to
Lissandra.
In
exchange
for
the
true
ice
club,
Trundle
said
that
he
would
fight
alongside
the
Frostguard
army
with
an
army
of
trolls,
although
it
doesn't
seem
he
would
keep
his
end
of
the
bargain.
