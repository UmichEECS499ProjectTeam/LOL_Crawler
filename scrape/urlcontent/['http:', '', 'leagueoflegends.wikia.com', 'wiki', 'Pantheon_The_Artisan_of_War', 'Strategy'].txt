Skill
usage
Pantheon
holds
the
highest
movement
speed
in
the
game
at
355,
tied
with
Master
Yi
.
Use
his
quick
movement
speed
and
strong
ranged
harass
from
Spear
Shot
to
whittle
your
opponents
down
in
lane
optimally
to
take
full
advantage
of
his
strong
early
game.
Pantheon
is
a
potent
tower
diver
because
of
his
passive,
Aegis
Protection
.
Since
using
Aegis
of
Zeonia
to
stun
an
enemy
also
refreshes
Aegis
Protection
,
he
can
easily
and
reliably
avoid
the
first
turret
hits
when
diving,
then
activate
Aegis
of
Zeonia
to
stop
the
enemy
champion's
movement
as
well
as
refresh
his
passive.
In
situations
where
Pantheon
stays
under
turret
fire
for
more
than
a
few
seconds,
he
may
be
able
to
activate
the
passive
again,
resulting
in
a
significant
amount
of
damage
ignored.
Use
this
fact
to
set
up
powerful
early-game
tower-dives
together
with
your
jungler.
This
also
works
well
against
physical
abilities
that
apply
on-hit
effects
such
as
Parrrley
,
Mystic
Shot
,
and
Bladesurge
,
or
turret
attacks.
This
will
not
block
physical
abilities
like
Volley
or
Ace
in
the
Hole
.
Note
that
Aegis
Protection
will
block
physical
attacks
but
not
on-hit
effects
associated
with
them
such
as
Blessing
of
the
Lizard
Elder
.
Learning
Spear
Shot
first
allows
Pantheon
to
get
minion
kills
easily
even
against
ranged
opponents.
When
facing
ranged
opponents
(especially
before
level
3),
be
sure
to
go
near
them
only
when
your
spear
is
off
cooldown
so
you
will
be
able
to
trade
one
ranged
autoattack
from
them
with
a
spear.
Stacking
attack
damage
items
will
allow
Pantheon
to
use
his
Spear
Shot
as
a
nuke
with
a
short
cooldown.
Using
Spear
Shot
frequently
in
a
battle
along
with
attack
speed
items
can
help
defensively
by
charging
Aegis
Protection
.
Certain
Death
can
be
very
useful
when
in
team
fights
since
Pantheon
can
gain
a
lot
of
critical
strikes
.
Using
Aegis
of
Zeonia
quickly
followed
by
Heartseeker
Strike
can
devastate
your
enemies.
Using
Grand
Skyfall
to
assist
your
allies
across
the
map
can
quickly
turn
the
tides
of
battle,
putting
your
allies
at
an
advantage.
While
in
mid
air
from
Pantheon's
Grand
Skyfall
you
can
select
a
target
for
Aegis
of
Zeonia
and
when
you
land,
you
will
jump
at
the
target
stunning
from
a
larger
distance
(est.
1300)
than
the
standard
range
(this
may
be
a
glitch).
Grand
Skyfall
makes
him
one
of
the
best
jungle
gankers
in
the
game,
since
he
can
ignore
ward
coverage.
Grand
Skyfall
can
be
combined
with
other
AoE
ultimates
such
as
Cannon
Barrage
and
Absolute
Zero
to
keep
the
enemy
in
the
AoE
radius
and
deliver
devastating
damage.
Due
to
Pantheon's
dependancy
of
mana
the
entire
game,
putting
a
mid
laner
that
does
not
use
mana
as
a
resource
system
(
Vladimir
,
Mordekaiser
)
will
give
you
more
chances
to
receive
Crest
of
the
Ancient
Golem
.
Even
though
Heartseeker
Strike
is
an
AoE
ability,
it
is
better
to
level
Spear
Shot
when
jungling.
Pantheon's
standard
combo
is
Aegis
of
Zeonia
,
followed
by
Spear
Shot
,
and
finishing
off
with
Heartseeker
Strike
.
(Or
possibly
starting
with
the
Spear
Shot
,
and
then
following
the
rest
of
the
combo,
when
the
combo
ends
Spear
Shot
should
be
off
cooldown
again,
allowing
another
shot.)
Having
Exhaust
and
Flash
as
summoner
spells,
along
with
Heartseeker
Strike
as
your
first
skill,
make
for
an
effective
first
blood
combination
when
in
a
side
lane
with
a
partner.
Those
summoner
spells
also
provide
two
good
escape
mechanisms.
Build
usage
Getting
a
Manamune
is
a
good
alternative
to
a
Chalice
of
Harmony
for
Pantheon
since
it
solves
his
mana
problems
and
gives
him
a
decent
amount
of
attack
damage.
Grabbing
a
Tear
of
the
Goddess
as
early
as
possible
will
ensure
you
can
stack
the
mana
quickly.
Stacking
attack
damage
items
like
B.
F.
Swords
(and
what
they
build
into)
means
Spear
Shot
and
Heartseeker
Strike
do
considerable
amounts
of
damage.
Building
an
early
The
Brutalizer
can
solidify
his
early
lane
dominance
and
help
you
take
your
lane
opponent
out
of
the
game.
If
you
find
your
opponents
are
escaping
you
too
often,
or
you're
being
focused
down,
a
Frozen
Mallet
will
give
you
some
additional
durability
in
fights,
and
ensure
that
fleeing
opponents
are
slowed
after
using
Aegis
of
Zeonia
to
engage
them.
Pantheon
is
an
AD
caster,
where
most
of
his
damage
comes
from
his
abilities
and
using
Spear
Shot
s.
As
such,
he
scales
better
with
armor
penetration
,
flat
attack
damage
,
and
cooldown
reduction
rather
than
flat
attack
speed.
The
Black
Cleaver
is
a
strong
offensive
item
and
can
apply
the
armor
shred
debuff
quickly
thanks
to
his
Heartseeker
Strike
.
It
also
gives
cooldown
reduction
and
health,
something
that
Pantheon
needs.
A
Last
Whisper
is
a
good
item
to
build
on
Pantheon
and
adds
a
lot
of
additional
burst
in
his
damage
providing
if
he
has
enough
attack
damage
items
such
as
The
Bloodthirster
.
Ravenous
Hydra
passive
and
active
synergizes
well
with
his
strong
wave
clear
with
Heartseeker
Strike
.
Youmuu's
Ghostblade
is
a
powerful
item
on
Pantheon
that
gives
him
the
armor
penetration
and
cooldown
reduction
he
needs.
In
addition,
it's
active
synergizes
well
with
his
high
natural
movement
speed.
While
Pantheon
does
not
benefit
from
their
attack
speed
or
the
ability
power,
a
Trinity
Force
is
a
good
item
to
build
for
the
Spellblade
passive
thanks
to
his
low
cooldown
of
Spear
Shot
.
He
also
jump
into
an
enemy
with
Aegis
of
Zeonia
and
follow
up
with
an
autoattack.
Blade
of
the
Ruined
King
is
often
built
for
the
active
for
extra
percent
health
burst
damage.
He
will
probably
will
not
benefit
from
it's
passive
and
attack
speed
though.
Because
Heartseeker
Strike
's
passive
makes
both
autoattacks
and
Spear
Shot
crit
100%
of
the
time
when
an
enemy
is
under
15%
health,
consider
Infinity
Edge
for
its
ability
to
increase
crit
damage
from
200%
to
250%.
Of
course
its
high
Attack
Damage
scales
well
on
Pantheon
's
abilities,
too.

Countering
Investing
in
a
Chain
Vest
or
Cloth
Armor
early
can
help
you
mitigate
his
damage
output.
Buying
health
can
help
you
to
survive
to
one
or
two
combos,
but
you're
going
to
need
health
regeneration
or
life
steal
to
sustain
yourself
in
lane
against
him.
After
two
combos
early
game,
he
can
be
without
mana
so
he
shouldn't
be
a
threat.
If
you
want
to
take
down
Pantheon's
Aegis
Protection
,
wait
for
his
jump
so
he
can't
recharge
it
easily.
When
laning
against
Pantheon
,
play
defensively
instead
of
aggressively.
Pantheon
may
be
squishy
but
his
damage
output
is
very
high
early
game.
Pantheon
has
no
escapes.
Baiting
him
to
attack
you
and
having
an
ally
appear
to
help
is
likely
to
spell
his
doom
without
the
use
of
summoner
spells
to
escape
you.
Avoiding
Pantheon's
Heartseeker
Strike
will
help
you
defeat
him.
If
someone
has
been
stunned
by
Aegis
of
Zeonia
,
it
is
unlikely
they
will
be
able
to
avoid
Heartseeker
Strike
-
but
that
does
not
mean
you
should
simply
let
it
hit
you.
Be
very
careful
of
Pantheon's
ganking
capability.
Pantheon's
Grand
Skyfall
allows
for
a
quick
and
deadly
gank.
Pantheon
can
also
use
Grand
Skyfall
to
backdoor
your
turrets.
Additionally,
Grand
Skyfall
can
be
used
to
escape
when
being
ganked
(or
counter
ganks)
if
you
realize
it
beforehand.
As
Pantheon
can
cast
Aegis
of
Zeonia
on
you
while
dropping
down
in
Grand
Skyfall
and
then
have
it
land
from
outside
its
normal,
using
dashes
and
escapes
to
avoid
Grand
Skyfall
may
have
you
stunned
nonetheless.
If
you
expect
to
survive
his
initial
burst
damage
after
being
stunned,
save
your
escapes
for
after
that
instead
of
getting
away
from
Grand
Skyfall
.
Of
course,
avoiding
the
damage
from
Grand
Skyfall
all
together
may
be
a
larger
concern
-
but
consider
the
possibility.
Try
to
avoid
the
center
of
Pantheon's
Grand
Skyfall
so
you
don't
suffer
the
full
damage
of
his
ultimate.
Avoid
laning
against
him
if
your
champion
relies
on
being
on
low
health
to
reap
the
full
potential
of
the
champion
(such
as
Olaf
and
Tryndamere
)
as
his
Certain
Death
will
cause
him
to
do
a
lot
more
damage
to
you
at
low
heath.
