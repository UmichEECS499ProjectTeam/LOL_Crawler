An
item
is
an
artifact
or
object
carried
by
champions
to
enhance
their
performance
on
the
Fields
of
Justice
.
A
champion
can
only
carry
six
items
and
a
Trinket
at
a
time,
making
the
selection
of
items
an
important
part
of
achieving
victory.
Items
are
only
obtainable
through
the
item
shop
located
at
the
Spawn
Pool
.
This
is
also
where
items
are
sold
back
for
70%
of
the
total
gold
spent
to
obtain
them.
The
exceptions
to
this
are
the
Prospector
,
Doran
,
&
Gold
Income
items,
Consumables
,
and
Guardian
Angel
,
which
return
40%
of
their
total
cost.

Classification
Items
are
divided
into
six
categories:
basic
,
advanced
,
legendary
,
mythical
,
consumable
,
and
trinket
.
A
basic
item
does
not
require
any
other
items
to
be
purchased.
If
an
item
requires
the
purchase
of
at
least
one
specific
basic
item
before
it
can
be
purchased,
that
item
is
considered
an
advanced
item.
All
basic
items
required
for
the
purchase
of
advanced
items
are
consumed
when
the
advanced
item
is
purchased.
The
same
is
true
for
legendary
items,
which
require
the
consumption
of
at
least
one
advanced
item,
and
mythical
items,
which
require
the
consumption
of
at
least
one
legendary
item.
Consumable
items
are
different
from
other
item
types
in
two
ways.
First,
most
consumable
items
may
be
stacked,
allowing
duplicates
items
to
occupy
the
same
item
slot
up
to
a
cap.
Secondly,
consumable
items
may
be
expended
to
perform
a
specific
function,
permanently
removing
that
item
from
the
champion's
inventory.
On
charge-based
items
such
as
the
Crystalline
Flask
,
the
charge
is
consumable
but
the
item
cannot
be
stacked
or
consumed.
Effects
Every
item
in
the
game
provides
some
sort
of
effect.
An
item's
primary
effect
is
usually
statistics,
however,
many
items
also
possess
secondary
effects
which
provide
champions
with
additional
benefits
beyond
raw
statistics.
Consumables
is
one
exception,
as
almost
all
consumables
provide
no
benefits
until
consumed.
In
addition,
some
effects
are
labelled
unique
(which
is
explained
below).
Statistics
improve
the
champion's
statistics
in
a
positive
way.
With
few
exceptions,
every
non-consumable
item
in
the
game
grants
some
form
of
statistic
increase.
The
only
exceptions
are
Hunter's
Machete
and
Spirit
Stone
.
Actives
are
triggered
by
clicking
on
the
item
or
by
pressing
the
item's
hotkey,
and
function
similarly
to
a
champion
ability
.
These
effects
have
cooldowns
before
they
can
be
used.
The
cooldown
of
activated
abilities
is
not
affected
by
cooldown
reduction,
although
it
can
be
reduced
via
the
Artificer
mastery.
Passives
are
effects
that
function
automatically,
like
the
passive
or
innate
abilities
of
a
champion.
Auras
are
buffs
or
debuffs
that
affect
nearby
friendly
or
enemy
units,
respectively.
All
aura
effects
are
unique.
The
holder
of
an
aura
item
is
not
considered
to
be
under
the
effects
of
the
aura,
and
thus
can
still
benefit
from
an
aura.
This
allows
auras
to
stack
up
to
twice
on
champions
who
posses
the
aura
themselves.
Other
allies
will
not
benefit
beyond
the
first
aura.
Consumable
items
generally
provide
no
benefit
until
consumed,
functioning
as
an
activated
item
effect.
Consumable
items
are
primarily
focused
on
either
gaining
map
control
through
the
use
of
wards
or
boosting
a
champion's
statistics
for
a
brief
period
with
potions
and
elixirs
.
Consuming
an
item
will
either
destroy
it
or
consume
a
charge,
similar
to
stock
abilities
.
Charge-based
consumable
items
are
refreshed
when
the
holder
returns
to
their
spawning
pool.
Unique
Some
item
effects
are
unique.
Typically,
a
unique
effect
means
that
if
a
champion
were
to
purchase
two
identical
items,
the
unique
effects
would
only
be
granted
once.
Some
items
grant
basic
statistics,
such
as
cooldown
reduction
and
spell
vamp
,
with
a
unique
tag
to
prevent
abusive
cases
where
the
item
could
be
stacked
to
exploit
the
statistics
it
provides.
Some
items
feature
unique
named
effects
,
such
as
Maim
.
A
named
effect
is
similar
to
a
unique
effect,
except
that
the
conditions
of
being
unique
are
global.
The
effects
of
the
named
effect
can
only
be
gained
once,
even
if
the
two
items
are
entirely
unrelated
(such
as
Tenacity
).
Notes
Unless
the
effect
is
named,
two
different
items
with
the
same
passive
will
stack.
For
example,
the
10%
cooldown
reduction
from
The
Brutalizer
and
Fiendish
Codex
will
stack,
however
owning
multiple
The
Brutalizers
will
not
grant
additional
cooldown
reduction.
This
is
likely
designed
as
such
to
deter
multiple
stacking
of
a
cost
efficient
item.
Only
the
unique/named-unique
effects
will
not
stack.
Other
effects
provided
by
the
item
will
stack.
