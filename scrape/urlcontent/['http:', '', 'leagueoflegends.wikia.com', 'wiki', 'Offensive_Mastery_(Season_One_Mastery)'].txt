"You
belong
in
a
museum!"
The
subject
of
this
article
was
removed
from
League
of
Legends
in
patch
V1.0.0.129
.
The
information
displayed
is
no
longer
relevant
to
League
of
Legends,
but
exists
here
for
historical
purposes.
Offense
Mastery
Tree
(Season
One)
Other
Mastery
Trees:
Defense
Â·
Utility
Offensive
Mastery
is
a
third
tier
offense
mastery
with
2
ranks.
Effect
per
rank
Increases
the
damage
you
deal
to
Minions
by
2.
(4
at
rank
2)
Requirements
Requires
8
points
in
Offense.
Notes
The
damage
is
an
on-hit
effect
and
only
applies
to
standard
attacks
and
abilities
that
specifically
mention
applying
on-hit
effects
(e.g.
Ezreal's
Mystic
Shot
or
Nasus's
Siphoning
Strike
).
While
the
tooltip
states
the
damage
increase
applies
to
Minions,
it
seems
to
also
apply
to
Neutral
Monsters
as
well.
