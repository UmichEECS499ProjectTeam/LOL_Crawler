Pix,
Faerie
Companion
(Innate):

fires
magical
bolts
of
energy
whenever

attacks
another

unit.
These

are
homing,
but
can
be
intercepted
by
other
units.

:
Pix
and
Lulu
each
fire
a

only
be
damaged
by
one

into
an

spells.
Help,
Pix!
:
If
cast
on
an
ally,
commands
Pix
to
jump
to
an

and
shield
them.

then
follows
them
and
aids
their
attacks.
If
cast
on
an
enemy,

to
jump
to
an
enemy
and
damage
them.

then
follows
them
and
grants
you
vision
of
that
enemy.

Growth
(Ultimate):
Lulu
enlarges
an
ally,
knocking
enemies
away
from
them
and
granting
them
a

that

that
slows
nearby
enemies.
