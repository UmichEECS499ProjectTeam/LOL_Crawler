on
the

"The
Freljord;
a
home
to
some,
a
grave
to
countless
more.
Lesser
clans
have
scrambled
for
the
right
to
rule
this
frozen
land
for
millennia
-
all
have
failed.
Now,
finally
three
great
leaders
have
emerged
to
rally
the
lesser
tribes
beneath
their
banners.
The
storms
of
war
will
cloud
when
their
paths
cross,
but
once
this
battle
is
over,
the
people
will
find
just
one
tribe
left,
to
rule
the
land."
―
Lissandra
Freljord
is
an
unforgiving
place.
A
mountainous
land
covered
in
snow
and
ice,
it
is
home
to
many
vicious
ice
storms.
Travel,
especially
in
the
winter,
can
be
very
dangerous.
The
elements
often
claim
even
those
who
have
spent
their
entire
lives
there.
Only
one
storm
exceeds
the
ones
found
in
Freljord:
the
Gelid
Vortex
-
a
swirling,
icy
maelstrom
which
circles
the
northern
hemisphere
of
Runeterra
.
Locations
Map
of
Freljord
There
are
8
currently
known
areas
of
Freljord.
Rakelstake,
once
a
village
where
the
Tribe
of
the
Ice
Dervish
lived
now
serves
as
the
capital
of
Freljord.
The
Gelid
Vortex,
a
powerful
maelstrom
located
north
of
Freljord,
surrounded
by
mountains.
The
Ursine
Village,
found
just
below
the
Gelid
Vortex's
mountains.
The
Ironspike
Mountains,
a
mountain
range
that
stretches
in
a
half
circle,
from
just
north
of
Noxus
to
Freljord
at
its
northernmost
point.
It
is
also
the
location
where
Anivia
has
made
her
home.
The
Avarosan
Iceflow
Glacier,
somewhere
beside
the
Gelid
Vortex
in
the
Ironspike
Mountains.
The
Howling
Abyss,
a
landmark
where
the
Iceborn
overthrew
their
oppressors
now
used
as
a
Field
of
Justice
by
the
Institute
of
War
.
[2]
Lokfar,
the
peninsula
where
the
Berserker,
Olaf
,
lived,
located
north
of
Sejuani's
territory.
The
Frostgaurd
Citadel,
where
Lissandra
and
her
Frostgaurd
keep
Freljord's
artifacts,
treasures
and
records
of
its
history.
Culture
The
Freljordians
were
once
a
divided
people
known
as
Iceborn
(a
race
once
thought
to
be
extinct)
with
"The
War
of
the
Three
Sisters"
having
left
the
denizens
splintered
for
generations.
The
region
was
divided
and
dominated
between
three
nomad
tribes:
The
Tribe
of
the
Frost
Archer
,
The
Tribe
of
the
Ice
Dervish
and
The
Tribe
of
the
Winter's
Claw
,
now
known
as
The
Avarosan
,
The
Frostguard
,
and
The
Winter's
Claw
respectively.
Over
the
years
the
tribes
would
have
occasional
skirmishes
with
one
another,
though
the
reasons
for
why
they
continued
fighting
had
been
long
forgotten
by
most.
The
tribes
are
ruled
by
the
three
Princesses:
Ashe,
the
Frost
Archer
;
Lissandra,
the
Ice
Dervish
;
and
Sejuani,
the
Winter's
Claw
.
In
more
recent
times,
with
the
crowning
of
their
new
Queen
,
the
Freljordians
have
started
the
process
of
mending
the
bonds
between
their
fractured
tribes.
Sentient
creatures
that
were
once
marginalized
and
secluded,
such
as
the
Yetis
and
the
Ursine,
were
now
given
a
voice
in
city-state's
government.
In
addition,
through
the
alliance
established
by
their
foreign
King
,
the
barbarian
tribes
of
northern
Valoran
have
migrated
to
Freljord
and
have
begun
integrating
their
own
traditions
into
the
Freljordian
society.
Freljordian
crest
Factions
Freljord
has
become
a
land
of
endless
conflict
since
the
"War
of
the
Three
Sisters"
broke
out.
Even
though
Freljord
already
has
a
sovereign,
tribal
leaders
still
fight
for
it
bringing
with
them
their
tribes.
The
Winter's
Claw
tribe
is
led
by
the
ferocious
Sejuani
.
Sejuani
wishes
to
conquer
the
Freljord
through
absolute
strength.
In
her
eyes,
the
Freljord
is
a
place
where
only
the
strong
deserve
to
prosper.
As
she
raids,
her
warriors
allow
the
stalwart
to
live
under
her
banner
while
they
pillage
the
weaker
tribes,
leaving
them
without
the
means
to
sustain
themselves.
Once
her
work
is
done,
only
the
mighty
will
be
left
in
the
Freljord.
Champions
that
have
allied
themselves
with
her
are:
Olaf
,
Udyr
,
and
Volibear
.
The
Avarosan
are
those
whom
are
loyal
to
Queen
Ashe
.
While
others
war,
Ashe
works
day
and
night
to
establish
a
single
alliance
throughout
the
Freljord.
Though
her
methods
are
peaceful,
she
is
still
backed
by
a
powerful
and
committed
army.
Champions
that
have
allied
themselves
with
her
are:
Tryndamere
,
Anivia
,
Gragas
and
Nunu
Hidden
beneath
an
eternal
winter,
The
Frostguard
dwell
deep
in
the
ruins
of
the
ancient
Freljord.
The
Frostguard
obey
their
leader;
Lissandra
.
Concealed
from
the
world
in
the
far
North
of
Freljord,
the
Frostguard
archive
of
all
Freljords
archaic
history.
Though
seemingly
peaceful,
the
truth
of
the
Frostguards
allegiance
is
far
more
disturbed.
The
world
had
forgotten
the
terrible
enemy
that
ruled
the
Freljord
long
ago
and
was
cast
into
the
depths
of
the
Howling
Abyss
following
a
long
and
brutal
battle.
And
now,
whilst
the
ignorant
sleep,
Lissandra
plots
to
return
her
masters
to
their
former
glory.
Only
the
trolls
and
their
king,
Trundle
have
allied
themselves
with
her.
Demographics
There
is
a
city
known
as
Rakelstake
in
Freljord,
which
was
inhabited
by
the
Tribe
of
the
Ice
Dervish.
[3]
It
is
believed
that
the
city
now
serves
as
the
capital
for
the
united
city-state.
Relations
with
Noxus
In
light
of
the
protections
that
the
League
has
extended
to
Freljord
-
and
consequently
to
the
barbarians
-
Noxus
issued
a
"stand
down"
order
to
troops
dispatched
to
their
Northern
Barbarian
Pacification
Campaign.
Katarina,
the
Sinister
Blade
,
delivered
the
command
herself.
She
stated
that
Noxus
abides
by
the
rules
of
the
League,
but
that
her
people
would
not
forget
the
offenses
perpetrated
by
the
barbarians.
Relations
with
Demacia
Demacia
and
the
people
that
now
make
up
Freljord
have
had
a
history
of
conflict,
albeit
nowhere
near
as
grievous
as
the
conflict
between
Noxus
and
the
northern
barbarian
tribes.
Both
Ashe
and
Tryndamere
have
been
highly
critical
of
Demacia’s
neutrality
during
Noxus’
Barbarian
Pacification
Campaigns.
In
fact,
Demacia
had
been
quite
protective
of
its
territory,
turning
away
refugees
during
the
campaign’s
more
bloody
episodes.
Likewise,
Demacia’s
northern
homesteads
were
often
times
targeted
by
barbarian
raiding
parties.
Both
city-states
have
a
great
deal
of
diplomatic
work
ahead
of
them
before
they
can
bridge
the
gap
that
spans
decades
of
distrust.
History
Era
of
the
Frozen
Watchers
Narrated
by
Lissandra
Lissandra
in
the
Howling
Abyss
Play
"The
Howling
Abyss.
A
bottomless
crevasse
surrounded
by
an
ancient
fortress
carved
into
a
glacier.
No
one
remembers
who
built
this
place.
No
one
knows
its
purpose.
No
one,
but
me."
"Long
before
Ashe
and
Sejuani,
before
magic
shattered
the
broken
peaks,
before
the
desert
swallowed
Shurima,
it
was
the
time
of
The
Three
Sisters.
We
were
so
young
back
then;
Avarosa,
Serylda,
and
me,
Lissandra."
"Back
then
the
Frozen
Watchers
lived
here.
I
do
not
know
where
they
came
from,
but
I
know
they
were
powerful.
They
gave
us
gifts,
shared
their
magic,
made
us
immortal.
They
named
us,
"
Iceborn
".
In
return,
we
gave
them
whatever
they
desired.
This
mighty
fortress,
a
vast
empire,
our
loyalty,
these
were
a
small
price
to
pay.
Avarosa
did
not
see
it
that
way.
Like
a
spoiled
child
she
cried
out
for
freedom.
She
demanded
choice.
She
sowed
the
seeds
of
rebellion
and
betrayal."
"This
place
is
where
it
happened.
On
one
side,
the
Frozen
Watchers,
on
the
other,
Avarosa
and
her
Iceborn
horde.
Many
Iceborn
died
that
day,
but
in
the
end,
the
Watchers
fell.
Avarosa
drove
them
howling
into
the
abyss.
I
never
forgave
her.
.
.
I
had
my
revenge
—
but
that
is
another
story."
A
Kingdom
Divided,
An
Evil
Awakened
Anivia,
the
Cryophoenix
Upon
the
rebirth
of
Anivia
,
she
witnessed
the
time
where
Freljord
was
but
one
great
kingdom.
She
protected
them
with
great
pride
as
they
prospered,
but
such
peace
could
not
be
eternal.
Avarosa,
the
Frost
Archer
was
the
true
queen
of
Freljord
but
her
two
sisters,
Serylda,
the
Winter's
Claw
and
Lissandra
,
the
Ice
Dervish,
also
wished
to
rule
the
kingdom.
Thus
sparked
a
legendary
war
known
as
"The
War
of
the
Three
Sisters".
Anivia
witnessed
these
events
and
tried
to
stop
this
war
from
turning
the
nation
into
ruins.
And
as
she
does
this,
an
ancient,
powerful
and
evil
yet
familiar
presence
began
to
stir.
She
felt
the
pure
magic
of
the
land
be
corrupted
by
it.
She
knew
that
if
it
was
completely
corrupted,
she
too
would
become
corrupted
and
turn
evil.
And
thus
began
her
journey,
to
unite
the
tribes
of
Freljord
and
destroy
the
source
of
darkness.
During
the
events
of
the
war,
an
assassination
had
happened.
Avarosa,
the
queen
of
Freljord,
had
been
murdered.
Many
of
her
iceborn
and
human
subjects
mourned
of
her
death.
They
buried
her,
far
beyond
the
outskirts
of
the
kingdom,
where
no
one
would
find
her
grave
and
defile
it.
They
built
a
cairn
atop
her
grave,
within
it,
her
beloved
bow,
crafted
from
true
ice,
and
marked
the
top
stone
with
a
single
rune,
Avarosa.
Avarosa's
Chosen
The
queen
of
Freljord
did
not
experience
a
grand
childhood.
Like
any
other
person
that
lived
in
the
Freljord,
she
experienced
hardship
through
her
youth.
At
the
age
of
fifteen,
Ashe's
mother
was
killed
during
a
raid
and
she
had
to
take
on
the
role
as
the
tribe
leader
of
the
Frost
Archer
tribe.
During
her
rule,
she
had
spoken
against
the
tribe's
demands
for
retribution
and
instead,
broke
an
everlasting
peace.
Her
warriors,
however,
did
not
accept
this
and
thus
planned
to
assassinate
her.
They
struck
while
Ashe
was
on
a
routine
hunt,
but
their
plan
was
interrupted
by
the
warning
cry
of
a
great
hawk.
Ashe
looked
back
to
see
her
tribesmen
approaching
with
swords
drawn.
Outnumbered
and
overwhelmed,
Ashe
ran
for
hours.
She
found
herself
deep
in
uncharted
territory,
her
weapon
lost
in
the
chase.
When
she
heard
another
cry
from
the
hawk,
Ashe
followed
it
to
a
clearing
where
she
found
the
bird
perched
on
a
pile
of
stones
-
an
ancient
Freljord
burial
cairn.
With
a
last
glance
at
her,
the
hawk
screeched
and
flew
away.
Approaching
the
mound,
Ashe
felt
her
breath
turn
to
frost
and
an
unnatural
cold
chill
her
to
the
bone.
The
stone
at
the
top
of
the
cairn
was
marked
with
a
single
rune:
Avarosa.
The
assassins
burst
into
the
clearing.
Ashe
lifted
the
runestone
from
the
cairn
to
defend
herself,
revealing
something
hidden
underneath:
an
ornate
bow
carved
from
ice.
She
grasped
it
and
tore
the
bow
from
its
resting
place.
Cold
flowed
from
the
enchanted
weapon
into
Ashe,
awakening
a
tremendous
power
that
had
always
lived
within
her.
She
drew
the
bow,
and
by
sheer
instinct,
willed
arrows
of
pure
ice
to
form
from
the
cold,
crisp
air.
With
a
single
frozen
volley,
she
ended
the
insurrection.
Carefully
replacing
the
cairn
stone,
she
gave
thanks
to
Avarosa
for
her
gift,
and
returned
home.
Ashe's
tribe
immediately
recognized
the
legendary
weapon
in
the
archer's
hand
as
a
blessing
from
the
ancient
Freljord
queen
herself.
With
Avarosa's
bow
and
her
vision
of
peaceful
unification,
Ashe's
tribe
soon
swelled,
becoming
the
largest
in
the
Freljord.
Now
known
as
the
Avarosan,
they
stand
together
with
the
belief
that
a
united
Freljord
will
once
again
become
a
great
nation.
Battle
on
the
Tundra
Ashe
wearing
the
White
Garments
of
Victory
Ashe,
the
Frost
Archer
,
was
leading
a
squadron
of
elite
archers,
her
closest
companions,
when
they
found
themselves
caught
in
a
wintery
nightmare
at
the
end
of
a
week-long
standoff
with
a
warring
tribe.
When
she
came
to,
Ashe
was
surrounded
by
the
tattered
corpses
of
friends
and
enemies
alike.
Only
divine
providence
had
spared
her
from
the
whirling
shards
of
ice,
and
her
hair
had
turned
the
color
of
the
arctic
tundra.
After
that
day
Ashe
never
again
wore
the
traditional
Freljord
White
Garments
of
Victory.
[4]
The
Yeti
Rider
Nunu,
the
Yeti
Rider
Nunu
had
only
the
vaguest
memories
of
his
parents
or
the
time
before
he
was
part
of
the
reclusive
Frostguard
tribe.
Never
welcome
among
his
caretakers,
Nunu's
wanderlust
and
compassion
often
put
him
at
odds
with
the
tribe's
elders
and
the
boy
frequently
dreamed
of
places
far
beyond
the
shadow
of
the
Frostguard
citadel.
Sometimes
he
would
do
more
than
just
dream,
much
to
the
frustration
of
his
minders.
This
was
never
more
apparent
than
when
Nunu
was
apprenticed
to
the
tribe's
beast
master
and
charged
with
the
care
of
the
creatures
under
his
yoke.
The
Frostguard
held
a
menagerie
of
the
Freljord's
wildlife
at
their
beck
and
call,
but
unique
among
their
collection
was
the
Yeti:
an
uncommon
creature
with
mystical
qualities
and
raw
physical
strength.
The
beastmaster
taught
Nunu
that
it
was
only
a
lean
diet
of
plants
and
regular
whippings
that
kept
the
vicious
beast
tame,
but
the
more
time
Nunu
spent
caring
for
the
creature,
the
more
he
learned
that
the
Yeti
was
no
feral
monster.
As
he
saw
his
new
friend
Willump
growing
weaker
and
sicker,
Nunu
began
to
sneak
the
Yeti
scraps
of
meat,
hoping
to
restore
his
health.
Day
by
day,
Willump
grew
stronger
and
not
the
slightest
bit
savage
contrary
to
the
beastmaster's
claims.
Nunu
had
hopes
of
convincing
him
that
the
Yeti
possessed
no
danger,
but
it
wasn't
meant
to
be.
The
next
time
Nunu
came
to
deliver
Willump
a
meal,
he
found
the
Yeti's
cage
shattered,with
only
a
crude
drawing
inside
signaling
the
Yeti's
farewell.
Without
hesitation,
Nunu
rushed
into
the
wilderness
in
search
of
his
friend.
When
Nunu
finally
caught
up
to
Willump,
he
found
the
Yeti
cornered
by
the
beastmaster
alongside
a
group
of
Frostguard
warriors.
Afraid
that
the
men
would
hurt
his
friend,
Nunu
threw
himself
between
the
Yeti
and
the
beastmaster's
lash,
but
the
brutal
man
would
not
stay
his
hand.
As
the
furious
beastmaster
raised
his
whip
once
more,
the
Yeti
swelled
up
with
uncharacteristic
fury.
Even
after
so
much
mistreatment,
it
wasn't
concern
for
himself
but
for
the
boy
who'd
shown
him
kindness
that
finally
pushed
Willump
too
far.
The
Yeti
raged
and
left
the
man
bloodied
in
the
snow.
Terrified
by
Willump's
fury,
the
remaining
Frostguard
warriors
fled.
Nunu
realized
there
was
no
going
back.
He
yelled
at
Willump
to
run
before
the
men
returned
to
kill
him,
but
the
Yeti
refused
to
leave
the
young
boy.
Nunu
was
faced
with
a
hard
choice:
abandon
his
sole
friend
and
lead
a
life
of
captivity
with
the
Frostguard,or
strike
out
into
the
harsh
wilds
and
leave
behind
the
only
home
he
knew.
Nunu
chose
the
only
path
that
made
sense.
Leaping
onto
the
back
of
the
mighty
Yeti,
Nunu
joined
Willump
in
his
great
escape.
The
pair
took
their
first
steps
into
the
wide
world
from
which
they
had
been
kept
for
so
long.
Alliance
with
the
Ice
Dervish
Princess
Lissandra
is
crowned
in
Rakelstake
Note:
The
Ice
Witch's
original
name
is
Lissandra.
When
taking
over
Princess
Mauvole,
she
named
Mauvole's
daughter
Lissandra
so
when
the
Ice
Witch
took
her
identity,
she
reclaimed
her
own
name.
One
of
the
rulers
of
the
three
tribes
that
controlled
the
region
-
Princess
Mauvole,
the
Ice
Dervish
–
was
found
dead
in
her
quarters
in
the
city
of
Rakelstake.
The
elders
of
her
tribe
determined
the
cause
of
death
to
be
natural,
which
cleared
the
way
for
the
new
Princess,
Lissandra,
to
claim
her
throne
and
the
title
of
Ice
Dervish.
In
Princess
Lissandra’s
first
act
after
her
coronation,
she
stunned
her
new
subjects
as
she
swore
fealty
to
another
of
the
three
Princesses
of
Freljord:
Ashe,
the
Frost
Archer
.
In
her
coronation
speech,
Lissandra
pleaded
with
her
people
that
the
time
had
come
to
unite
Freljord
under
a
single
banner.
Lissandra’s
words
swayed
her
kin:
her
coronation
speech
was
warmly
received
by
her
tribe,
and
her
tribe’s
elders
signaled
their
solidarity
with
their
Princesses’
desire
for
unification.
However,
the
third
of
the
Freljord
Princesses
–
Sejuani,
the
Winter's
Wrath
–
remained
fiercely
adamant
in
her
opposition
of
the
other
two.
Sejuani
retreated
to
isolation
with
the
elders
of
her
tribe.
This
caused
concern
among
the
members
of
the
other
tribes,
who
believed
she
may
be
readying
for
war.
Alliance
with
the
Northern
Barbarians
Ashe
and
Tryndamere
announce
their
alliance
As
weeks
passed,
the
modest
population
of
Freljord
were
shocked
as
hundreds
of
barbarians
-
including
Tryndamere,
the
Barbarian
King
-
arrived
to
pay
their
respect
to
the
late
Princess
Mauvole
of
the
Ice
Dervish
tribe.
Ashe
was
present
for
the
barbarian
procession,
and
she
met
afterward
with
Tryndamere
and
Lissandra
for
a
private
dinner.
The
arrival
of
the
barbarians,
some
predicted,
was
due
to
an
invitation
from
Ashe
to
Tryndamere
in
order
to
deter
Princess
Sejuani
from
taking
any
aggressive
action.
It
later
became
clear
that
Tryndamere's
visit
was
not
entirely
a
selfless
venture,
but
for
the
negotiation
of
a
mutually
beneficial
opportunity.
After
weeks
of
meetings
and
discussion,
Ashe
accepted
Tryndamere's
offer
to
join
forces
with
the
barbarians.
Her
decision
was
met
with
resounding
support
by
the
members
of
the
Frost
Archer
and
the
Ice
Dervish
tribes.
Ascension
to
City-State
Status
After
examining
the
turn
of
events
within
Freljord,
High
Councilor
Vessaria
Kolminye
made
a
proclamation
from
the
Luminary
Cloister
of
the
Institute
of
War
,
granting
sovereignty
to
Freljord
and
conferring
upon
it
all
the
rights
and
protections
afforded
to
city-states.
With
its
newfound
status,
Freljord
was
allotted
one
League
Assembly
chair.
Their
chosen
Emissary
was
entitled
to
reside
at
the
Institute
of
War
and
cast
votes
in
League
Assemblies
on
Freljord’s
behalf.
Freljord
may
also
appeal
to
the
League
for
general
arbitration
of
political
affairs.
While
Freljord
had
applied
for
membership
in
the
past,
its
previous
appeal
was
denied
on
the
grounds
that
its
population
was
insufficient,
and
it
lacked
both
a
defined
governmental
structure
and
the
means
to
police
itself.
Ashe's
recent
ordainment
as
leader
of
Freljord's
two
united
tribes,
bolstered
by
the
might
and
numbers
of
Tryndamere's
barbarians,
was
enough
to
sway
the
opinion
of
the
Council
of
Equity.
The
New
Queen
and
King
are
Crowned
Queen
Ashe
crowns
Tryndamere
as
her
chosen
king
Immediately
following
Kolminye's
address,
the
united
tribes
crowned
Ashe
the
Queen
of
Freljord.
Ashe
was
the
first
princess
to
ascend
to
the
throne
since
the
Three
Sisters
War
divided
their
people.
According
to
Freljordian
tradition,
the
Queen
selects
the
King
to
rule
by
her
side.
Ashe
selected
Tryndamere
,
solidifying
her
arrangement
with
the
barbarian
tribes.
On
the
topic
of
her
choice,
Ashe
stated
that
her
actions
are
guided
by
the
needs
of
her
people,
not
by
romantic
notions.
The
union
was
a
pledge
to
reinforce
their
commitment
to
the
alliance.
Ashe
also
appointed
League
Champion
Nunu,
the
Yeti
Rider
,
as
Freljord's
League
Emissary,
stating
that
the
yetis
will
for
now
on
be
a
part
of
their
new
society.
Queen
Ashe
later
offered
Princess
Sejuani
a
seat
on
Freljord’s
new
Royal
Advisory
Council.
Sejuani
emerged
from
her
reclusion
to
respond,
stating
that
she
would
never
accept
Ashe
as
her
Queen,
and
that
anyone
who
did
so
was
contributing
to
the
perversion
of
their
culture.
However,
her
opinion
was
not
echoed
by
her
people,
as
hundreds
of
Winter’s
Claw
tribesmen
journeyed
to
Rakelstake
to
attend
Ashe’s
coronation.
There,
Nunu
accepted
his
appointment
proudly,
and
the
largest
contingent
of
yetis
ever
witnessed
by
humanity
was
present
for
the
celebration.
Hordes
of
barbarians
also
migrated
to
their
new
home,
many
arriving
to
view
the
second
crowning
of
their
King.
Tryndamere
welcomed
his
people
with
an
inspiring
declaration,
stating
that
they
finally
have
a
voice
in
Valoran,
and
could
now
be
seen
as
they
truly
were:
proud
and
noble
warriors.
The
Avarosa
Iceflow
Purchase
Gragas,
the
Rabble
Rouser
Gragas,
the
Rabble
Rouser
,
made
a
journey
to
the
Avarosa
Iceflow,
Freljord’s
Northern-most
glacier,
in
search
of
the
purest
waters
in
all
of
Runeterra.
The
League
champion
arrived
to
Freljord
to
stake
his
claim
to
the
arid
ice
field.
Meeting
with
King
Tyndamere
and
Queen
Ashe
,
the
Rabble
Rouser
impressed
upon
his
hosts
the
significance
of
this
locale
to
his
brewing
art,
imploring
them
to
entrust
it
into
his
custody.
Seizing
the
opportunity
to
capitalize
on
the
development
of
an
otherwise
treacherous
territory,
the
monarchs
happily
obliged.
Gragas
signed
an
agreement
to
lease
the
Avarosa
Iceflow
from
Freljord
for
an
astonishing
9,000
years,
ensuring
that
the
cherished
water
supply
will
be
his
for
the
brewing
long
into
the
future.
His
dealings
with
the
monarchs
were
then
concluded
appropriately
and
according
to
tradition:
with
a
drink.
Atop
the
wellspring,
Gragas
constructed
the
first
large
scale
brewing
operation
for
his
most
famous
libation:
the
legendary
Graggy
Ice.
Visions
of
the
End
Volibear,
the
Thunder's
Roar
Before
ascension
as
the
lone
chieftain
of
the
Ursine,
Volibear
was
the
revered
shaman
of
the
tribe.
He
saw
that
peace
had
made
his
people
soft
and
weak,
forgetting
the
sacred
art
of
war.
He
felt
that
the
fire
of
their
souls
was
soon
diminishing.
He
told
the
triumvirate
of
chieftains
of
his
misgivings
but
he
was
ignored.
Seeking
wisdom,
he
went
to
the
top
of
their
sacred
mountain,
a
place
shrouded
by
the
Gelid
Vortex.
The
maelstrom
is
said
to
be
magical,
and
it
was
the
one
who
chooses
the
chieftain
of
the
Ursine.
Upon
reaching
the
summit,
Lightning
struck
him
and
when
he
awoke
he
saw
a
vision
of
the
Ursine
being
mercilessly
slaughtered
by
ice
monsters.
When
the
vision
ended
he
hurried
to
the
tribe
and
there
the
chieftains
lie
in
wait
for
him.
They
battled
him
and
before
Volibear
fell,
he
summoned
the
maelstrom's
power
and
defeated
them.
Because
of
this,
the
triumvirate
appointed
him
as
the
new
chieftain.
He
immediately
then
began
to
arouse
his
tribe
from
complacency,
revived
their
battle-hardened
traditions,
and
finally
forged
his
alliance
with
Sejuani
,
the
warrior
who
would
fight
with
them
against
the
coming
evil
.
Journey
Into
the
Freljord
Trivia
The
history
of
Freljord
is
heavily
featured
on
The
Journal
of
Justice
Issues
2
to
5.
It
narrates
the
crowning
of
Ashe
and
Tryndamere
as
Queen
and
King
of
Freljord,
the
constitution
of
Freljord
as
a
League
City-State
and
the
general
background
of
the
area.
The
"Avarosans"
were
named
after
the
ancient
and
most
venerated
Queen
of
Freljord,
Avarosa,
the
Frost
Archer.
The
three
legendary
sisters'
names
are,
Avarosa,
Serylda
and
Lissandra.
The
Lissandra
of
the
three
sisters
is
the
same
Lissandra
who
is
now
known
as
"
The
Ice
Witch
",
effectively
making
her
an
ancient
ancestor
of
Ashe
and
Sejuani
.
The
Frozen
Mallet
,
Guardian's
Horn
,
Iceborn
Gauntlet
,
Shard
of
True
Ice
and
Seeker's
Armguard
are
all
artifacts
that
belonged
to
the
"Iceborn"
,
a
demonym
for
those
who
were
given
power
over
ice
by
the
Frozen
Watchers.
The
Guardian's
Horn
was
made
to
warn
Freljord
when
the
Frozen
Watchers
returned.
True
ice
is
a
phenomenon
that
exists
only
in
the
coldest
depths
of
the
Freljord.
A
magical
matter
so
cold
it
can
never
melt,
master
smiths
have
managed
to
craft
this
strange
substance
into
powerful
weapons
and
armor.
Trundle's
club,
Boneshiver,
Sejuani's
bola
and
Ashe's
bow
are
made
from
True
Ice.
There
is
an
event
between
the
three
Freljordian
leaders,
Ashe
,
Sejuani
and
Lissandra
,
called
"
Battle
for
Freljord
".
This
event
shows
one
of
the
possible
outcomes
if
any
of
the
three
were
to
defeat
the
other
and
win
the
right
to
rule
Freljord.
