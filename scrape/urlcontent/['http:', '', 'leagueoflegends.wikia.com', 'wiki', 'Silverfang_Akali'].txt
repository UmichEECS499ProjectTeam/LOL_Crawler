Trivia
Akali
was
designed
by
Coronach
.
Akali
is
voiced
by
Laura
Bailey
.
In
Japanese,
Akali
is
read
as
Akari
(明),
which
means
"Light,
Bright,
Cheerful,"
contrasting
to
her
title,
"The
Fist
of
Shadow".
In
Sikhism,
Akali
is
a
word
that
is
used
for
referring
to
someone
or
something
that
is
"Divine".
Akali
was
one
of
the
champions
chosen
for
the
Ionian
pool
available
during
the
Ionia
vs.
Noxus
match
.
However,
she
was
not
one
of
the
selected
champions.
Akali's
Shadow
Dance
,
was
originally
a
skill
shot
rather
than
the
point-and-click
skill.
Akali
carries
a
pair
of
kamas
into
battle.
Akali's
dance
is
a
direct
reference
to
Beyoncé's
Single
Ladies
.
A
side-by-side
comparison
can
be
seen
here
.
Akali
is
currently
the
only
Energy-based
champion
to
have
any
associated
cost
on
their
Ultimate
Ability
(1x
Essence
of
Shadow
).
Quotes
Akali's
joke
is
a
tongue-in-cheek
reference
to
the
criticism
towards
the
matchmaking
system,
often
matching
up
teams
of
wildly
varying
levels,
causing
lower-leveled
players
to
be
swiftly
defeated
by
higher-level
ones.
Akali
is
one
of
only
2
champions
that
says
the
word
"noob",
the
other
one
being
Sion
Akali's
quote:
"Tread
lightly."
is
similar
to
Shen's
quote:
"Tread
carefully."
Skins
Classic
Akali
resembles
Jade
from
the
Mortal
Kombat
series.
Silverfang
Akali
resembles
Ryu
Hayabusa
from
the
Ninja
Gaiden
game
series.
Stinger
Akali
resembles
the
main
character
from
Quentin
Tarantino's
movie,
Kill
Bill
,
hence
her
blood
spattered
yellow
clothing
and
weapons.
Stinger
Akali
is
likely
a
reference
to
Scorpion
from
the
aforementioned
Mortal
Kombat
,
as
her
costume
and
color
scheme
are
similar,
as
well
as
the
fact
that
scorpions
have
stingers.
Crimson
Akali
resembles
Taki
from
the
Soul
Calibur
series.
The
All-Star
Akali
skin,
along
with
the
soccer
skins
for
other
champions,
appeared
just
before
the
2010
World
Cup
started,
and
were
removed
from
the
store
on
October
31,
2010.
Nurse
Akali
,
Kennen
M.D.
and
Surgeon
Shen
share
a
Medical
skin
theme.
The
Chinese
Splash
Art
for
her
Nurse
skin
can
be
found
in
The
Journal
of
Justice:
Volume
1,
Issue
19
.
Surgeon
Shen
can
be
seen
in
a
frame
above
Akali
in
the
splash
art.
This
are
the
between
the
few
skins
that
are
confirmed
to
be
part
of
the
lore.
Nurse
Akali
was
proposed
by
the
community
Akali
and
Blood
Moon
Shen
share
a
Blood
Moon
skin
theme.
The
masks
they
are
wearing
are
a
reference
to
the
masks
worn
at
the
Japanese
Noh
theatre
theater.
Silverfang
Akali
shares
a
striking
resemblance
to
Nightblade
Irelia
in
design.
Relations
Akali
is
a
member
of
the
Kinkou
Order
along
with
Kennen
and
Shen
.
The
three
shadow
warriors
work
together
in
order
to
preserve
the
balance
in
Valoran
.
Akali
and
her
fellow
ninjas
are
at
war
with
Zed
and
his
Order
of
Shadows.
During
a
contagion
outbreak
at
the
Institute
of
War
,
Akali
volunteered
as
a
nurse
and
can
be
seen
administering
a
mandatory
shot
to
Amumu
.
[1]
Akali
may
have
another,
more
personal
connection
with
Zed
.
Perhaps
she
is
former
member
of
Order
of
Shadows
-
RiotRunaan
pointed
out
her
title
(the
Fist
of
Shadow)
and
passive
Twin
Disciplines
,
and
mentioned
that
Zed
once
had
a
favourite
student
who
left
his
Order,
but
there
was
no
official
statement.
[2]
It
is
also
mentioned
that
despite
appearances,
she
has
capacity
for
violence
and
cruelty.
[3]
Despite
this,
or
perhaps
in
some
way
due
to
it,
Akali
is
apparently
the
least
disposed
of
the
Kinkou
triumvirate
towards
forgiving
Zed
in
any
way,
believing
that
only
death
is
suitable
for
him,
in
contrast
with
Kennen
,
who
believes
that
there
is
a
possibility
for
Zed
to
be
redeemed
(while
Shen
is
undecided).
Japan
Earthquake
Marc
Merrill
symbolically
giving
a
162,430.00$
cheque
to
the
American
Red
Cross
Akali
and
her
Nurse
skin
were
on
a
50%
sale
from
March
21
to
March
27,
2011.
All
the
revenues
generated
by
this
special
sale
were
donated
to
the
American
Red
Cross
to
aid
the
population
of
Japan
after
the
earthquake
of
March
11th
.
A
week
later,
Riot
Games
President
Marc
Merrill
stated
the
following:
[4]
Summoners!
This
past
March
11
marked
one
of
the
greatest
natural
disasters
in
recorded
history.
In
an
effort
to
support
those
affected
by
the
devastation,
we
invited
all
League
of
Legends
players
to
donate
to
the
American
Red
Cross
by
purchasing
the
Nurse
Akali
skin
or
the
champion
Akali
with
RP.
The
promotion
ran
for
all
of
this
past
week,
during
which
time
100%
of
all
proceeds
from
this
champion
and
skin
were
collected
for
the
Japan
Earthquake
and
Pacific
Tsunami
Fund.
In
the
end,
over
50,000
summoners
chose
to
participate.
We
invited
our
partners
from
the
Red
Cross
down
to
the
Riot
Games
office
to
accept
your
donations,
which
totaled
over
$160,000
!
We
have
witnessed
the
power
in
the
community
in
the
past,
but
you
never
cease
to
amaze
us.
Riot
Games
and
the
American
Red
Cross
would
like
to
thank
you
for
your
generosity,
and
for
stepping
in
to
contribute
to
the
relief
efforts
in
the
wake
of
this
global
tragedy.
