Profile
Travis
brings
over
five
years
of
professional
design
experience
to
Riot
Games.
After
finishing
a
program
at
one
of
those
New
Fangled
Game
Schools,
Travis
started
out
working
for
Activision
on
a
few
games,
most
notably
an
X-Men
game
where
he
designed
Nightcrawler's
powers
and
gameplay
from
start
to
finish.
He
then
wandered
the
great
Gaming
Abyss
before
landing
at
Perpetual
Entertainment
where
he
turned
his
love
of
playing
online
games
into
a
love
of
working
on
them.
Travis
has
crossed
over
to
the
dark
side
of
Production,
and
now
serves
as
Riot's
Gameplay
Producer,
where
he
manages
the
Design
Team
and
works
to
get
the
most
fun
into
the
game
as
time
allows.
Special
Ability
Eye
of
Discernment
:
Using
his
vast
stores
of
Arcane
Knowledge,
Travis
is
able
to
detect
and
decipher
what
the
most
critical
and
fun
elements
of
the
game
will
be
to
make
sure
they
get
in
the
game
on
time.
Trivia
The
champion
Volibear,
the
Thunder's
Roar
,
is
named
after
him.
