Trivia
Riven
was
designed
by
Xypherous
.
When
Xypherous
was
creating
Riven's
character,
her
backstory
was
a
little
different.
In
her
former
backstory,
she
was
a
Demacian
who
was
exiled
for
rescuing
Noxian
refugees
from
Demacian
persecution.
After
Riven's
backstory
was
changed
to
being
a
Noxian,
Xypherous
took
some
inspiration
from
the
Japanese
manga/anime
series
Rurouni
Kenshin
,
particularly
from
the
character
Seta
Sōjirō
,
the
Heaven's
Sword.
[1]
Her
story
is
also
reminiscent
of
Aragorn
from
Lord
of
the
Rings
saga;
Aragorn
was
exiled
with
a
broken
sword
which
was
reforged
in
his
path
to
defeat
Sauron
and
recover
his
kingdom.
Xypherous
states
that
the
theme
he
and
Riot
were
going
for
with
Riven
was,
"Noxus
is
broken,
but
through
my
will
and
the
fight
-
Noxus
can
be
remade."
[2]
Riven's
name
and
title
is
likely
reference
to
the
Myst
series
of
games,
the
second
and
third
games
being
named
"Riven"
and
"Exile",
respectively.
Riven's
backstory
and
name
also
resemble
Revan
from
the
game
Knights
Of
the
Old
Republic.
In
the
sequel
Knights
Of
the
Old
Republic
2
the
main
character
is
called
The
Exile.
"Riven"
literally
means
torn
apart,
or
broken
asunder.
Riven
is
voiced
by
Cristina
Valenzuela
.
Xypherous
has
stated
that
the
original
pitch
for
Riven
was
"gooder
than
good".
[3]
Riven's
skill
set
is
inspired
by
Marth's
move
set
from
the
game
Super
Smash
Bros.
Melee
.
[4]
Marth's
character
is
originally
from
Intelligent
Systems'
Fire
Emblem
series.
Riven
was
codenamed
"Marth"
during
her
design
phase.
While
most
of
her
"Marth
move
sets"
ended
up
not
being
used,
her
Broken
Wings
mirrors
Marth's
Dancing
Blade.
After
the
release
of
Riven's
"Champion
Sneak
Peek",
there
was
a
preview
of
her
appearance
in
PC
Gamer
Magazine
.
When
her
"Champion
Sneak
Peek"
was
originally
posted,
Riven's
title
was
"The
Exile",
but
was
later
changed
into
"The
Shattered
Exile".
Her
title
has
since
been
changed
back
to
being
"The
Exile"
in
her
"A
New
Champion
Approaches".
Riven's
"A
New
Champion
Approaches"
page
was
leaked
accidentally
in
the
announcements
forum,
but
was
then
quickly
replaced
by
the
Golden
Joystick
Awards
2011
post.
Riven
was
released
concurrently
with
the
end
of
Season
One
.
Riven's
dance
is
based
on
the
"Water
Dance
of
Braavos"
from
the
HBO
series
Game
of
Thrones
.
Before
Riven's
release
her
passive,
Runic
Blade
,
was
known
as
the
"Art
of
War".
This
can
be
seen
in
her
"Champion
Spotlight".
In
Riven's
"Mechanics
Preview",
her
Ki
Burst
was
called
"Ki
Shout".
(
Mike
Laygo
(Ohmikegoodness)
)
animated
Riven.
He
also
animated
"The
Kid"
from
the
game
Bastion
.
Riven's
Quote
"A
broken
blade
is
more
than
enough
for
the
likes
of
you!"
is
similar
to
Bleach's
main
character
Ichigo
Kurosaki
who
say
"A
dull
blade
is
more
than
enough
for
the
likes
of
you!"
when
battling
Grand
Fisher.
Quotes
While
using
her
ultimate
Blade
of
the
Exile
,
Riven
gains
an
additional
taunt
and
joke,
as
well
as
other
various
emotes.
During
Blade
of
the
Exile
,
Riven's
voice
seems
to
have
an
echo.
Skins
Classic
Riven's
splash
art
was
revised
four
times
before
her
release,
causing
her
to
have
no
Art
Spotlight
before
her
release,
as
it
was
common
at
the
time
for
a
champion
to
have
one.
Riven
has
another
splash
art
for
her
Classic
skin
as
shown
in
the
champion
spotlight
while
previewing
her
skins.
Redeemed
Riven's
sword
can
be
seen
in
the
preview
video
of
the
Mac
Version
of
League
of
Legends.
Riven
is
the
second
and
last
champion
to
receive
a
Crimson
Elite
skin,
the
first
being
Talon.
Crimson
Elite
was
the
counter
to
the
Demacian
Commando
skins
and
has
since
been
abandoned.
Riven
was
the
second
champion
to
have
a
special
skin
marking
the
end
of
Season
without
having
to
obtain
a
rank
of
Gold
or
higher
to
obtain,
the
first
being
Kayle.
Redeemed
Riven
is
likely
a
reference
to
her
former
backstory
in
which
Riven
was
an
exile
from
Demacia.
Her
armor
appears
similar
to
that
of
some
Demacian
champions.
Riven's
sword
for
her
Redeemed
skin
has
a
turqoise-colored
light
outlining
the
area
it
was
shattered.
After
Riven's
release,
her
Redeemed
Splash
Art
showed
her
having
blue-colored
clothing
while
in
game
her
clothing
was
teal-colored.
This
was
fixed
to
where
both
the
Splash
Art
and
the
in-game
skin
showed
her
having
teal-colored
clothing.
Redeemed
Riven
also
has
a
concept
art
showing
her
clothing
with
red
color.
This
version
bears
a
striking
resemblance
to
War
from
the
Darksiders
games.
Battle
Bunny
Riven
is
based
on
the
community-suggested
"Bunny
Girl
Riven"
from
this
community
thread
and
artworks
,
which
themselves
were
based
on
Playboy
bunnies
.
It
was
first
featured
as
part
of
Riot's
Urf
Day/April
Fool's
Day
celebrations.
It
was
viewable
in
Riven's
in-game
profile
for
that
day,
labeled
'Unavailable'.
The
game
was
later
patched
to
remove
it
from
view.
In
the
Splash
Art,
Urgot
,
,
Talon
Vladimir
,
Swain
,
and
Zac
can
be
seen
in
the
background.
The
Splash
Art
contains
2
easter
eggs,
Zac
and
Swain's
Tyrant
skin
.
Relations
During
an
Ionian
ambush
on
Noxian
troops,
Singed
launched
a
barrage
of
biochemical
terror
on
both
forces.
Riven
witnessed
as
around
her
Ionian
and
Noxian
alike
fell
victim
to
an
unspeakably
gruesome
fate.
This
incident
led
Riven
to
wander
in
self-imposed
exile,
seeking
atonement
and
searching
for
her
own
way
to
serve
the
pure
Noxian
vision
in
which
she
believed.
In
the
new
League
of
Legends
website,
Riven
is
listed
as
Varus
'
rival.
This
suggests
that
she
was
directly
involved
in
the
assault
of
Varus'
village
during
Noxus'
invasion
of
Ionia.
It
is
hinted
that
Riven
was
the
killer
of
the
Ionian
elder
that
Yasuo
was
supposed
to
protect.
