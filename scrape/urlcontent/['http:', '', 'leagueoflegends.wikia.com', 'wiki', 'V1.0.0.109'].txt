League
of
Legends
V1.0.0.109
Champions
Renekton,
the
Butcher
of
the
Sands
(
Original
Stats
)
Renekton
uses
a
new
resource
system
called
Fury.
Renekton
gains
Fury
by
attacking
or
dealing
damage
with
spells.
When
he
has
gathered
enough
Fury,
the
resource
will
be
expended
to
empower
his
skills
with
bonus
effects.
Cull
the
Meek
:
Renekton
swings
his
blade,
dealing
damage
to
nearby
enemies
and
healing
for
a
portion
of
the
damage
dealt.
Fury
Bonus
:
Heal
amount
raised
dramatically.
Ruthless
Predator
:
Renekton's
next
attack
swings
twice,
dealing
damage,
plus
a
large
portion
of
his
base
damage,
stunning
his
target
briefly
and
applying
on-hit
effects
each
time.
Fury
Bonus
:
Renekton's
next
attack
swings
three
times,
dealing
a
huge
portion
of
his
weapon
damage,
stunning
his
target
greatly
and
applying
on-hits
each
time.
Slice
and
Dice
:
Renekton
dashes
forward,
dealing
physical
damage
to
targets
along
the
way.
If
he
hits
a
target,
he
can
use
Dice
for
a
brief
period
of
time
for
the
same
effect.
Fury
Bonus
:
Renekton
deals
50%
increased
damage
and
reduces
the
armor
of
units
hit.
Dominus
(Ultimate):
Renekton
empowers
himself
with
dark
energy,
gaining
size
and
bonus
health.
He
deals
periodic
damage
to
enemies
around
him
and
rapidly
gains
Fury.
Reign
of
Anger
(Innate):
Renekton
gains
5
Fury
per
autoattack.
Having
sufficient
fury
empowers
Renekton’s
abilities
with
bonus
effects,
but
this
drains
Fury.
Out
of
combat,
Renekton
loses
5
Fury
per
second.
Caitlyn
Piltover

Damage
loss
per

increased

from

Maximum

loss
increased
to
50%
from
30%.
Ace
in
the
Hole
:
Base
damage
increased
to
250/475/700
from
250/400/550.
Now
provides
vision
on
the
target
for
the
duration
and
thus
is
not
canceled
when
the
target
leaves
line
of
sight.
Damage
is
now
treated
as
a
spell
instead
of
an
attack.
No
longer
triggers
hit
effects
like
Blessing
of
the
Lizard
Elder
.
Now
triggers
spell
hit
effects
like
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
.

or

Protection
.

We

streaks

get
no

hits/dodges
in

row,
or
a
lot
of
them
in
a
row.
Your
average
chance
to
get
a
crit
is
the
same
as
before
though
–
if
you
have
a
50%
crit
rate,
and
you
make
100
attacks,
you’ll
still
crit
about
50
times.

Wrath

the
Ancients

resistance
now

magic
resistance
of
zero.

update
when
scouted
with
vision.
Chat
will
now
display
the
Champion
being
played
by
the
person
who
is
speaking.
