Trivia
Diana's
mechanic
design
was
done
by
Volty
,
her
visual
design
was
done
by
IronStylus
,
and
RiotRunaan
and
RiotHarrow
both
worked
on
her
creative
design
and
lore.
[1]
Diana's
weapon
is
based
on
a
sickle
or
a
khopesh
(an
Egyptian
sickle-sword).
[2]
It
is
often
jokingly
referred
as
a
"Khopsickle"
or
"Chop-sickle"
by
the
community
and
IronStylus.
[3]
Diana's
name
originates
from
the
Roman
goddess
of
the
moon.
Diana
is
the
first
champion
to
have
a
unique
login
screen
music
in
which
a
song
with
lyrics
is
played.
The
writer
of
the
song
is
RiotRunaan
,
the
vocalist
is
RiotSaiyaka
and
the
composer
is
Christian
Linke
.
[4]
RiotSaiyaka
,
the
graphic
designer
who
sang
Daylight's
End
(Diana's
theme)
,
also
made
the
unique
targeting
reticle
for
Diana's
Crescent
Strike
.
[5]
[6]
[7]
Diana
is
the
first
champion
to
have
specific
running
animations
for
whenever
she
is
slowed
and
chasing
a
target.
Quotes
Diana's
quote,
"The
moon
also
rises"
is
a
counter
reference
to
Leona's
quote,
"The
sun
always
rises."
Diana
and
Leona
both
share
the
quote,
"Twilight
fades."
Diana's
quote,
"The
moon
will
rise,
the
night
will
last
forever!"
is
a
reference
to
Nightmare
Moon
,
from
the
television
show
My
Little
Pony:
Friendship
is
Magic
by
Lauren
Faust,
who
shares
that
quote
with
her
and
other
similarities.
Skins
Dark
Valkyrie
Diana
is
reference
to
the
valkyries
,
a
host
of
female
figures
from
Norse
mythology
who
wander
the
battle
fields
retrieving
slain
warriors
who
are
to
be
brought
to
Valhalla
after
a
glorious
death
in
battle.
Dark
Valkyrie
Diana
skin
is
the
dark
counterpart
of
Valkyrie
Leona
skin.
Dark
Valkyrie
Diana
was
originally
released
with
a
headdress
covering
the
mark
on
her
forehead.
The
skin
was
later
changed
with
the
removal
of
the
headdress
and
an
alternate
face
because
it
bore
too
much
of
a
resemblance
to
Syndra
.
There
is
a
distinct
rabbit
shaped
cloud
above
the
tip
of
Diana's
Khopesh
in
the
Lunar
Goddess
skin
splash.
This
could
mean
the
skin
is
a
reference
to
Chang'e,
the
Chinese
goddess
of
the
moon.
In
Chinese
Server
Lunar
Goddess
skin
is
named
“广寒仙子
嫦娥”（The
fairy
of
Moon
Chang‘e）,
which
is
officially
reference
to
Chang'e.
and
base
on
the
skin
reveal
page
by
Tencent
Games,
the
skin
idea
is
from
an
Anonymous
Tencent
LOL
Designer.
Relations
Diana
was
made
to
be
"a
foil
for
Leona
"
(-
IronStylus)
,
with
Diana
being
the
"Chosen
of
the
Moon"
and
Leona
being
the
"Chosen
of
the
Sun".
The
"Chosen
of
the
Moon"
and
the
"Chosen
of
the
Sun"
depicted
in
the
mural
are
not
Diana
and
Leona,
but
their
ancient
predecessors.

Diana's
Theme
–
"Daylight's
End"
Ask
not
the
sun
why
she
sets
Why
she
shrouds
her
light
away
Or
why
she
hides
her
glowing
gaze
When
night
turns
crimson
gold
to
grey
For
silent
falls
the
guilty
sun
As
day
to
dark
does
turn
One
simple
truth
she
dare
not
speak:
Her
light
can
only
blind
and
burn
No
mercy
for
the
guilty
Bring
down
their
lying
sun
Blood
so
silver
black
by
night
Upon
their
faces
pale
white
Cruel
moon,
bring
the
end
The
dawn
will
never
rise
again
