Vision
The
Fog
of
War
is
the
effect
that
takes
place
on
areas
of
the
map
that
are
not
within
the
vision
range
of
an
allied
champion,
minion,
or
ward.
This
means
that,
while
a
player
can
see
the
topography
of
any
area
on
the
map,
they
cannot
see
enemy
or
neutral
units
that
are
in
the
Fog
of
War.
For
champions,
Fog
of
War
sets
in
at
1200
range.
Areas
which
are
not
obscured
by
the
Fog
of
War
are
brighter
on
the
map.
