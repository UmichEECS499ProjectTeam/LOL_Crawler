Fighters
are
melee
combatants
that
possess
a
mix
of
offensive
and
defensive
capabilities.
While
they
don't
have
as
much
utility
as
a
tank
or
as
much
damage
as
an
assassin,
a
fighter's
damage
will
add
up
over
time
to
make
it
a
major
threat.
Each
fighter
has
a
unique
blend
of
mobility,
damage,
disruption
and
durability.
