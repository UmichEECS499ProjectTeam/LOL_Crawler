"You

The
subject
of
this
article
was
removed
from
League
of
Legends
.
The
information
displayed
is
no
longer
relevant
to
League
of
Legends,
but
exists
here
for
historical
purposes.

Example
Surge
was
a
'non-targeted'
Summoner
Spell
available
in
all
game
modes.
As
part
of
the
season
three
overhaul,
this
summoner
spell
was
removed.
Its
functionality
was
added
in-part
to
Guinsoo's
Rageblade
,
which
uses
Surge's
icon
while
in
effect.

Strategy
It
was
a
highly
efficient
tool
for
all
AP
characters
pushing
turrets
as,
unlike
towards
any
other
targets,
if
40%
of
your
AP
is
greater
than
your
AD
bonus
your
champion
is
going
to
add
that
amount
to
the
base
damage
of
the
autoattack
instead
of
the
bonus
attack
damage.
The
bonus
attack
speed
helps
significantly,
as
well.
If
used
prior
to
abilities
which
have
a
longer
duration
than
Surge
itself,
those
abilities
will
retain
the
enhanced
ability
power
from
surge
even
after
it
has
expired.
Some
examples
include
Heimerdinger's
H-28G
Evolution
Turret
,
Teemo's
Noxious
Trap
,
Maokai's
Sapling
Toss
,
etc.
Notes
The
spell
increases
the
size
of
the
character
model
of
your
champion.
This
spell
can
not
increase
your
attack
speed
over
the
set
cap
of
2.5.
