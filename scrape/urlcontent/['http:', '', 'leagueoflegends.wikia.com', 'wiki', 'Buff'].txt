or
newly
available
information.
V3.14
:
Old
Masteries
A
buff
is
any
status
effect
given
to
a
champion
or
a
minion
that
gives
them
a
beneficial
boost
in
their
performance.
A
buff
that
gives
negative
effects
is
called
a
debuff
.
Buffs
can
boost
almost
any
attribute
of
a
character,
such
as
health
,
mana
,
damage
,
and
ability
power
.
Positive
changes
to
champions
or
items
in
the
Patch
Notes
can
also
be
called
buffs
,
while
negative
changes
can
be
called
nerfs
.
Some
buffs
can
stack
a
predetermined
number
of
times
while
other
buffs
may
not
be
stacked.
This
means
that
repeated
applications
of
the
buff
to
the
same
target
will
not
grant
him
any
increased
effect
but
will
only
cause
the
buff
duration
to
reset.
Most
buffs
are
temporary
but
some
buffs
may
last
indefinitely
(such
as
Tristana's
Draw
a
Bead
boosting
her
attack
range).
Other
buffs
are
lost
upon
champion
death.
There
are
several
sources
for
buffs
and
debuffs
in
League
of
Legends,
specifically
items
,
abilities
,
spells
and
epic
monsters
.

Item
buffs
These
are
buffs
that
come
from
the
items
you
can
buy
from
the
shop
in
exchange
for
gold
.
Every
item
will
boost
one
or
several
statistics
by
default
however
there
are
additional
effects
on
some.
These
come
in
the
form
of
passive
effects
that
are
persistent
as
long
as
the
item
is
not
sold.
Auras
boost
not
only
yourself,
but
your
allies
as
well.
And
active
effects
that
boost
you
and
sometimes
your
team
mates
significantly
for
a
short
period
of
time.
These
active
effects
usually
have
a
cooldown
attached
to
them.
Ability
buffs
These
are
champion
abilities
which
increase
stats
when
acquired
with
levels
.
These
come
in
the
same
category
as
item
buffs;
Passive,
Aura
and
Active.
These
abilities
usually
grow
stronger
with
more
ability
power
,
attack
damage
,
and/or
levels.
Summoner
spell
buffs
These
are
summoner
spells
which
increase
stats
when
used
or
coupled
with
the
right
masteries.
For
example,
Ghost
increases
your
movement
speed.
Ignite
is
the
inverse
case,
as
the
ability
power
bonus
is
only
in
effect
when
Ignite
is
on
cooldown.
Monster
buffs
These
are
temporary
buffs
acquired
by
slaying
jungle
monsters.
For
example,
the
Ancient
Golem
grants
the
Crest
of
the
Ancient
Golem
buff.
In
this
case,
the
monster
usually
has
swirling
colored
runes
around
it.
Other
monsters,
specifically
Baron
Nashor
and
Vilemaw
,
grant
a
powerful
buff
to
the
entire
killing
team.
Dominion
With
the
development
and
ultimately,
release,
of
the
Dominion
gametype,
new
kinds
of
game
elements
will
be
brought
to
the
table
[1]
.
This
also
includes
the
new
buffs
[2]
.
Shrines
Shrines
are
areas
on
the
Crystal
Scar
that
grant
a
short
duration
movement
speed
bonus
to
champions
that
pass
through
them.
These
shrines
are
neutral
and
can
be
used
repeatedly
throughout
the
game.
Relics
Relics
come
in
two
forms:
lesser
and
greater.
Lesser
relics
provide
a
small
replenishment
in
health
and
mana
for
the
champion
that
picked
up
the
relic.
Whereas
greater
relics
provide
a
personal
shield
and
damage
amplification.
Lesser
Relics
spawn
on
specific
locations
at
short,
regular
intervals,
and
can
be
picked
up
to
restore
health
and
mana.
Champions
from
either
team
can
acquire
a
health
relic
simply
by
moving
over
it.
They
are
available
2
minutes
into
the
game,
and
after
consumption
respawn
every
30
seconds.
Greater
Relics
are
a
pair
of
powerful
team
specific
objects
that
spawn
at
the
center
of
the
map.
While
the
Greater
Relics
spawn
less
frequently
than
Health
Relics,
they
provide
powerful
offensive
bonuses
that
help
assault
particularly
well-fortified
capture
points.
Acquiring
these
Greater
Relics
requires
a
brief
channel
time.
They
are
available
3
minutes
into
the
game,
and
after
consumption
take
3
minutes
to
respawn.
Capturing
a
Greater
Relic
takes
10
seconds.
