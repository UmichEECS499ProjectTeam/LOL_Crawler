Galio,
the
Sentinel's
Sorrow
is
a
champion
in
League
of
Legends
.
[1]
Abilities
Runic
Skin
Galio
gains
50%
of
his
total
magic
resistance
as
ability
power.
Ability
Details
Additional
Information:
Runic
Skin
is
inversely
affected
by
effects
that
reduce
Galio's
magic
resistance,
such
as
Soraka's
Starcall
.
The
magic
resistance
reduction
will
reduce
Galio's
ability
power
for
the
duration
of
the
effect.
When
Galio's
magic
resistance
is
brought
below
0,
he
will
lose
ability
power.
Ability
power
has
a
lower
cap
of
0.
On
the
other
hand,
Runic
Skin
is
triggered
by
his
own
ability,
Bulwark,
as
well
as
any
other
effect
that
gives
him
temporary
Magic
Resist.
Casting
Bulwark
right
before
another
ability
will,
therefore,
increase
the
impact
of
that
second
ability.
