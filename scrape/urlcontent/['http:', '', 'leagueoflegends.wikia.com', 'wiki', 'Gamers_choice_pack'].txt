Gamers
choice
pack
"You
belong
in
a
museum!"
The
subject
of
this
article
was
removed
from
League
of
Legends
.
The
information
displayed
is
no
longer
relevant
to
League
of
Legends,
but
exists
here
for
historical
purposes.
The
Gamer's
Choice
Pack
was
a
bundle
that
was
removed
with
the
introduction
of
Flexible
Cost
Bundles.
[1]
It
was
similar
to
the
Champions
Bundle
where
a
summoner
can
opt
to
spend
a
lump
sum
of
3900
for
20
champions
as
well
as
a
single
bonus
skin.
This
bundle
does
not
come
with
any
Runes
or
Riot
Points.
This
bundle
includes
the
Huntress
Sivir
skin
which
is
exclusive
to
this
pack.
Purchasing
each
champion
individually
comes
out
to
25,200
or
10,790
The
price
of
the
pack
is
not
reduced,
and
there
is
no
refund
of
RP
or
IP,
if
you
already
have
one
or
more
champions
in
the
bundle.
It
is
not
economical
to
get
it
once
you
have
a
certain
percentage
of
the
champions
or
if
there
are
not
enough
champions
you
are
interested
in
playing
that
you
do
not
already
have.
