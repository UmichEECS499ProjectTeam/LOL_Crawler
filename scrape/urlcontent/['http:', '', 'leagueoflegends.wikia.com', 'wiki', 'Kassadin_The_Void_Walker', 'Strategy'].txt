Against
enemy
mages,
Null
Sphere
is
an
effective
harassment
tool
that
is
unblockable
by
creep
waves.
The
shield
can
be
used
to
absorb
spells
sent
in
retaliation.
Null
Sphere
is
expensive
at
its
first
tier.
Its
mana
cost
is
lower
per
level
in
terms
of
damage
dealt
as
points
are
spent
on
it;
max
it
first
only
if
you
plan
to
poke
the
enemy
laner
and
not
to
farm
with
it.
You
can
use
Null
Sphere
on
a
minion
to
mitigate
unavoidable
magic
damage
(from
H-28G
Evolution
Turrets
you
need
to
destroy,
Requiem
,
or
Dark
Wind
).
Nether
Blade
and
Riftwalk
can
be
used
dually
for
quick
and
efficient
farming.
Kassadin
is
fairly
easy
to
kill
if
he
can't
Riftwalk
away.
When
engaging
the
enemy,
consider
whether
it'd
be
better
to
Riftwalk
in,
cast
your
spells,
and
walk
out,
or
to
walk
in,
cast
your
spells,
and
Riftwalk
out.
Kassadin's
abilities
have
high
ability
power
ratios
and
low
cooldowns,
so
a
high
amount
of
AP
enables
him
to
deal
immense
damage
in
short
time
intervals.
As
an
assassin,
Kassadin
excels
at
ganking.
Also,
he
is
best
at
focusing
lone,
fragile
or
injured
targets.
With
all
of
this
in
mind,
Kassadin
performs
best
entering
in-progress
team
fights,
either
slaying
a
carry
quickly
and
jumping
out,
or
moving
in
once
an
enemy
carry
has
been
slain
and
the
enemy
team
is
beginning
to
disperse
or
retreat,
to
pick
off
injured
champions.
Unless
it
is
urgent,
when
traveling
with
Riftwalk
wait
until
just
before
your
last
Riftwalk
counter
has
expired
before
casting
it
again
as
stacking
Riftwalk
can
deplete
your
mana
very
quickly.
Riftwalk
can
be
used
to
jump
over
walls,
and
essentially
acts
like
the
summoner
spell
Flash
.
On
Twisted
Treeline,
you
can
Riftwalk
from
the
wall
behind
your
nexus
to
the
nearby
Shadow
Altar
or
vice-versa.
This
is
extremely
useful
if
you
need
to
escape
after
locking
an
altar.
Kassadin
is
great
for
laning
with
or
against
champions
with
spammable
spells
such
as
Karthus
and
Cassiopeia
as
they
ensures
that
Force
Pulse
is
always
charged.
Kassadin
lanes
extremely
well
with
Soraka
for
a
couple
of
reasons:
Starcall
is
a
spammable
skill
and
can
easily
charge
your
Force
Pulse
.
Kassadin
is
a
melee
mage
champion.
In
other
words,
he
needs
to
get
into
melee
range
to
deal
most
of
his
damage.
The
bonus
armor
and
heal
from
Astral
Blessing
can
help
Kassadin
greatly.
While
roaming,
you
can
charge
Force
Pulse
without
spending
mana
by
repeatedly
activating
Nether
Blade
.
A
risky
way
to
deal
a
lot
of
burst
damage
to
enemies
is
to
constantly
cast
Riftwalk
at
the
summoner
pool.
This
will
stack
the
damage
on
Riftwalk
while
the
summoner
pool
regenerates
your
mana.
Using
this
method
with
summoner
spell
Teleport
can
inflict
devastating
damage.
Build
Usage
Kassadin
can
be
built
as
a
high-mobility
mage
or
as
an
ambush
assassin,
and
his
prime
statistics
are
ability
power
and
mana
(as
both
his
Riftwalk
damage
and
Nether
Blade
mana
restore
scale
in
mana).
In
a
similar
vein
like
Ryze
,
Kassadin
can
be
effectively
built
tanky
since
most
mana
items
often
grant
defensive
stats
like
health
and
armor
.
In
fact,
it's
actually
beneficial
to
build
a
bit
tanky
on
Kassadin
since
he
needs
to
get
close
to
eliminate
enemies.
Since
building
AP
and
having
high
AD,
along
with
gap
closers
and
short
cooldowns,
Lich
Bane
is
especially
usefully
in
most
offensive
builds.
It
also
provides
him
with
more
movement
speed
and
mana
with
his
bonus
damage.
If
the
team
lacks
any
strong
crowd
control
,
it's
also
a
good
idea
to
build
an
Iceborn
Gauntlet
,
as
this
item
provides
mana,
cooldown
reduction,
and
defensive
stats.
In
addition,
Kassadin
can
apply
a
powerful
slow
with
an
autoattack
after
using
Riftwalk
or
Nether
Blade
.
Zhonya's
Hourglass
can
be
used
to
bait
enemies
into
wasting
valuable
spells
on
Kassadin
after
using
Riftwalk
to
enter
a
fight.
It
is
also
an
excellent
item
against
strong
counters
like
Zed
and
Talon
.
With
3
points
in
Riftwalk
,
you
can
blink
in,
finish
off
a
single
target
with
your
spell
combo,
use
the
Stasis
active,
and
immediately
Riftwalk
out
when
it
ends.
Using
Deathfire
Grasp
,
Kassadin
can
Riftwalk
past
the
enemy
team
and
burst
down
a
carry
with
Deathfire
Grasp
->
Nether
Blade
->
Force
Pulse
->
Null
Sphere
->
Ignite
.
Adding
Zhonya's
Hourglass
allows
him
to
escape
unharmed
afterwards.
With
his
Nether
Blade
passive
and
active,
it
is
possible
to
build
Kassadin
as
Magical
DPS
with
Nashor's
Tooth
or
Wit's
End
,
though
due
to
the
rarity
of
the
build
and
lack
of
proper
testing,
the
effectiveness
of
this
build
is
questionable.
If
attempting
such
a
build,
Arcane
Blade
and
high
AP
are
necessary
along
with
some
tankiness.
Tear
of
the
Goddess
can
help
Kassadin
deal
with
his
high
mana
costs.
While
Manamune
seems
to
be
an
interesting
item
to
build
for
Muramana
,
the
passive
will
not
proc
from
Force
Pulse
or
Riftwalk
,
making
this
a
gimmicky
offensive
item
for
AD
or
hybrid
builds.
An
Archangel's
Staff
is
a
better
option
since
it
not
only
provides
ability
power
scaled
based
on
mana,
but
he
also
gain
a
defensive
shield
that
expends
a
percentage
of
mana
once
it's
upgraded
to
a
Seraph's
Embrace
,
which
synergizes
well
with
Null
Sphere
.
However,
like
Ryze
,
it
is
conceivable
to
build
two
Tear
of
the
Goddess
for
both
items
at
the
expense
of
stacking
both
Tears
longer.
A
Frozen
Heart
is
a
good
item
to
build
on
Kassadin
thanks
to
the
large
amount
of
mana
the
item
gives,
the
cooldown
reduction
,
and
the
high
armor
.
It
also
allows
Kassadin
for
more
offensive
plays
and
the
attack
speed
slow
grants
him
strong
teamfight
potential
when
he
gets
into
range.
A
Rod
of
Ages
and/or
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
gives
Kassadin
the
survivability
he
needs
when
using
Riftwalk
on
a
group
of
enemies.
When
built
as
an
Anti-Mage
with
magic
resistance,
a
Banshee's
Veil
is
a
must.
Getting
the
Chalice
of
Harmony
increases
mana
regen
greatly.
The
magic
resistance
is
also
a
nice
plus,
considering
his
passive
and
his
anti-squishy
role.
Riftwalk
and/or
Flash
together
with
Cleanse
and/or
Quicksilver
Sash
will
let
you
escape
even
the
deadliest
ganks.
As
with
most
pure
AP
carries,
Rabadon's
Deathcap
and/or
a
Void
Staff
are
essential
for
damage
as
you
progress
into
the
late
game.
When
playing
as
an
anti-mage,
Abyssal
Scepter
is
an
excellent
choice
since
all
his
abilities
fall
inside
its
range.

Countering
Kassadin
is
a
fearsome
anti-mage
due
to
Void
Stone
and
Null
Sphere
.
Since
he
specializes
in
countering
AP
champions,
an
AD
mid
is
a
good
counter
in
laning
phase.
Kassadin
mostly
deals
magic
damage;
therefore,
stacking
magic
resistance
will
mitigate
his
damage.
Buying
magic
penetration
to
face
Kassadin
is
not
recommended,
as
his
passive
doesn't
give
him
magic
resistance;
the
way
Void
Stone
works
is
by
reducing
15%
of
the
Magic
Damage
taken
after
applying
resistances,
so
magic
penetration
will
only
affect
him
partially.
Force
Pulse
can
only
be
activated
if
he
has
enough
stacks.
Engaging
him
when
he
has
no
stacks
can
help
kill
him
faster.
In
the
laning
phase,
especially
on
a
solo
lane,
it
can
be
very
hard
for
Kassadin
to
keep
stacks
on
his
Force
Pulse
,
so
casting
spells
sparingly
can
greatly
reduce
his
damage
output.
Manually
detonating
a
two-part
spell
such
as
Lucent
Singularity
or
Death's
Caress
adds
an
extra
charge
to
Force
Pulse
,
so
it
may
be
beneficial
to
let
these
spells
expire
on
their
own.
Kassadin
has
trouble
killing
minions
waves
quickly
in
the
early
game,
as
Force
Pulse
is
not
always
available,
leaving
him
with
only
melee
attacks
and
the
long-cooldown
Null
Sphere
.
Playing
a
champion
with
strong
AoE
spells
can
allow
you
to
push
your
minions
to
Kassadin
's
turret,
which
will
force
him
to
either
lose
gold
income
when
the
turret
kills
your
minions,
or
stay
in
melee
range
of
your
minions,
leaving
him
vulnerable
to
your
ranged
spells
and
attacks
from
outside
the
turret's
range.
Mordekaiser
can
deal
well
with
Kassadin
's
spells
due
to
his
naturally
high
magic
resistance,
wave
clear
potential,
and
the
shield
provided
by
Iron
Man
.
The
AoE
provided
by
Siphon
of
Destruction
and
Mace
of
Spades
can
farm
minions
quickly
and
deny
Kassadin
's
roam,
risking
to
lose
a
turret
if
he
leaves
the
lane.
Kassadin
must
be
near
your
minions
to
use
Nether
Blade
.
Zoning
him
from
this
range
can
force
him
to
run
out
of
mana.
Predicting
Kassadin's
Riftwalk
movement
is
effective
in
countering
him,
as
his
harass
combo
involves
mostly
Riftwalk
ing
into
range,
and
dropping
a
Null
Sphere
.
For
example,
Brand
,
by
casting
Pillar
of
Flame
and
Sear
with
correct
aim
and
timing,
can
damage
and
stun
Kassadin
during
his
attempt
to
harass.
Be
aware
that
Null
Sphere
's
shield
is
immediate
and
does
not
depend
on
the
projectile
landing.
As
a
melee
assassin,
Kassadin
must
close
the
gap
to
begin
fighting,
and,
more
importantly,
must
initiate
the
fight
to
do
all
of
his
practical
damage.
With
this
in
mind,
being
able
to
close
in
before
he
can
Riftwalk
or
even
applying
your
crowd
control
first
will
considerably
buff
your
chances
of
slaying
him
or
at
least
taking
him
down
with
you.
Do
not
use
Flash
to
get
away
from
Kassadin
because
his
Riftwalk
has
a
7-second
cooldown
at
rank
1.
Because
of
the
mobility
offered
by
Riftwalk
,
it
is
crucial
that
your
jungler
ganks
Kassadin
before
he
reaches
Level
6.
Chasing
Kassadin
when
he
has
Riftwalk
is
not
practical.
Pantheon
is
known
for
dominating
Kassadin
early
game
due
to
his
constant
Spear
Shot
pressure
and
killing
potential.
Also,
Aegis
of
Zeonia
can
be
utilized
to
lock
down
Kassadin
and
assist
ganks
from
the
jungler.
Jayce
can
use
his
Transform:
Mercury
Cannon
form
to
harass
and
bully
Kassadin
out
of
lane
early.
Most
ranged
AD
champions
can
bully
Kassadin
out
of
lane
as
Void
Stone
only
protects
from
magic
damage.
While
unconventional,
facing
a
2v1
lane
can
be
extremely
detrimental
to
Kassadin
,
especially
if
he
goes
for
the
Tear
of
the
Goddess
+
Catalyst
the
Protector
build
path
focused
on
late
game.
