Blitzcrank’s
Fleshling
Compatibility

Fired
Up
and
Ready
to
Date
FS
interviewing
Blitzcrank
on
a
paid
advertisement
from
his
Fleshling
Compatibility
Services
Blitzcrank
shows
off
some
of
his
compatibility
service's
success
stories.
Enter
Blitzcrank
.
Yes,
you
heard
me,
Blitzcrank.
But
what
on
Runeterra
could
a
steam
golem
have
to
do
with
dating?
It
turns
out
he
could
potentially
solve
all
of
your
problems
with
just
a
few
mathematic
equations
and
a
Valoran
-wide
network
of
magic
machines.
A
little
over
six
months
ago,
the
Great
Steam
Golem
traveled
in-between
League
battles
to
purchase
commercial
sites
and
begin
the
construction
of
a
chain
of
magically-outfitted
cafés
called
Pairing
Eligibility
Reactors
of
Valoran.
He
built
one
of
these
in
every
major
city,
and
also
in
minor
outposts
all
across
Valoran.
Even
Bilgewater
now
hosts
a
PERV
in
the
middle
of
the
market
district.
What
exactly
were
these
cafés
for?
I
recently
had
the
chance
to
interview
Blitzcrank,
and
you’ll
be
surprised
to
hear
what
I
found
out.
FS:
“So,
Blitzcrank,
you
are
an
esteemed
League
champion
and
the
favorite
of
many
summoners
.
Why
are
you
building
all
of
these
cafés
across
Valoran?
And
why
are
they
called
Pairing
Eligibility
Reactors?”
Blitzcrank:
“THESE
CENTERS
SERVE
AS
MAGICAL
HOTSPOTS
WHICH
ARE
ALL
CONNECTED
IN
REAL
TIME
REGARDLESS
OF
DISTANCE
AND
CAN
TRANSMIT
DATA
BETWEEN
EACH
OTHER.
I
CALL
IT
“THE
BLITZERNET”.

OF
BLITZCRANK’S
FLESHLING

WHICH

LAUNCH
IN
6
DAYS,
7
HOURS,
AND
42
MINUTES.”
FS:
“Blitzcrank’s
Fleshling
Compatibility
Services?
That
sounds
pretty
morbid.
What
does
that
mean?”
Blitzcrank:
“THEY
ARE
ELECTABLE
SERVICES
AVAILABLE
TO
ALL
CITIZENS
OF
VALORAN
REGARDLESS
OF
CITY-STATE
AFFILIATION
WHICH
WILL
ASSIST
FLESHLINGS
IN
THEIR
ENDEAVORS
TO
MEET
OTHER
COMPATIBLE
FLESHLINGS
FOR
COMPANIONSHIP,
MATING,
AND
PROCREATIVE
PURPOSES.”
FS:
“You’re
running…
a
dating
service?
At
the
risk
of
sounding
presumptive
and
rude,
what
would
a
steam
golem
know
about
dating
and
love?”
Blitzcrank:
“I
HAVE
BEEN
STUDYING
FLESHLINGS
OF
ALL
TYPES

DEVELOPED
A

EQUATIONS
THAT
CAN
DETERMINE

AND
LONG-TERM
OUTCOMES

FS:
“Wow,
that’s
amazing!
How
does
it
work?”
Blitzcrank:
“USERS

Born
Out
of
Necessity
The
History
of
the
Executioner’s
Calling
Reira
Kashuld
commenting
from
the
Institute
of
War
I
love
artifacts
and
armaments.
I
really,
really
do.
In
my
hometown
of
the
Kashuld
Province
in
Ionia
,
there
is
no
greater
pride
than
our
knowledge,
love,
and
craft
for
artifacts.
From
the
most
basic
cloth
armor
to
the
most
intricate
of
Negatron-Alloy
woven
cloaks,
the
specs
and
methods
of
craft
really
set
my
heart
aflutter.
This
is
especially
the
case
when
considering
a
blade
with
as
rich
a
history
as
the
Executioner’s
Calling
Long
Sword
.
More
often
than
not
new
weaponry
is
born
out
of
necessity.
Ridley
and
Hollow
Armaments
(R.H.
Armaments),
a
weapons
contractor
based
in
the
city-state
of
Noxus
,
has
always
remained
a
very
stable
business.
This
is
mostly
due
to
the
good
relationship
they
have
with
the
city-state
itself,
whose
contracts
makes
up
more
than
70%
of
the
company’s
revenue.
Fifteen
years
ago
during
the
Noxian
invasion
of
Ionia,
the
standard
issue
weapon
for
the
frontline
troops
was
the
Conquest
I
Long
Sword
(the
grandfather
of
the
R.H.
Armaments
Long
Sword
that
is
used
in
the
League
today).
Its
popularity
is
owed
to
its
rugged
durability,
ease
of
use,
and
low
production
cost
for
an
iron
weapon.
The
Conquest
I
Long
Sword
was
so
popular
in
its
day
that
you
could
find
one
in
nearly
every
Noxian
household!
During
the
war,
the
Noxian
forces
encountered
many
problems
when
facing
Ionian
military
units.
This
was
in
part
because
Ionian
squads
always
contained
at
least
one
medical
officer
which
gave
Ionians
an
advantage
in
small
skirmish
situations.
To
match
this,
R.H.
Armaments
developed
the
Executioner’s
Calling
Long
Sword
(ECLS1).
The
ECLS1
was
not
made
entirely
out
of
plain
iron
like
the
original
Conquest
I,
but
instead
was
forged
of
82%
Iron
and
18%
Scarlet
Steel,
which
helped
fuel
the
relentless
attacks
of
the
Noxian
army.
The
blade
itself
was
thinner
and
sturdier,
allowing
the
wielder
to
precisely
target
the
enemy’s
vital
points,
this
however
came
at
the
cost
of
overall
heft
and
raw
power.
The
most
interesting
modification
to
the
ECLS1
was
a
barbed
hook
at
the
very
tip
of
the
blade,
which
was
used
for
tearing
into
enemies
on
each
attack.
This
inflicted
a
very
severe
wound
that
was
difficult
for
healers
to
mend,
and
caused
progressive
tissue
damage
well
after
the
initial
injury.
In
response
to
this,
the
Ionian
military
changed
their
tactics
and
began
to
utilize
more
ranged,
hit-and-run
strategies
to
keep
the
Noxians
at
bay.
This
was
when
R.H.
Armaments
countered
with
the
ECLS2
–
a
modified
version
of
the
ECLS1
with
an
eject-able
barb
at
the
end
of
the
blade.
With
a
simple
flick
of
the
wrist,
experienced
users
can
fire
the
barb
at
enemy
targets
from
a
distance.
This
“feature”
was
met
with
some
contention,
however,
due
to
it
requiring
much
more
training
to
use
effectively
than
the
ECLS1.
The
Arcanum
Majoris
approved
the
original
ECLS1
for
use
in
League
matches,
but
they
upgraded
to
the
ECLS2
on
February
24th,
20
CLE
last
year.
Currently
the
League
uses
the
ECLS2-L
(League)
model,
which
was
specifically
commissioned
by
the
Arcanum
Majoris.
The
ECLS2-L
features
a
slightly
higher
amount
of
scarlet
steel,
at
the
cost
of
a
bit
more
weight.
The
result
provides
much
more
life-essence
siphoning
than
the
original.
The
weapon
itself
is
a
joy
to
use.
It
has
perfect
50-50
weight
balance
which
is
barely
thrown
off
by
ejecting
the
barb.
The
almost
rapier-like
shape
of
the
blade
offers
unparalleled
precision
versus
any
other
blade
in
its
class.
My
only
complaint
is
that
the
stock
handle
is
shoddily
molded
and
slippery.
The
Executioner’s
Calling
Long
Sword
was
a
tide-turning
weapon
developed
in
a
time
of
need.
Although
its
ease-of-use
is
often
put
in
question,
it
can
be
devastating
in
the
hands
of
a
skilled
wielder.
It
works
well
in
a
situation
where
more
“permanent”
damage
is
necessary
and
will
get
the
job
done
when
used
correctly.
R.H.
Armaments
has
not
released
any
information
on
a
third
model
yet,
but
I
will
be
the
first
to
bring
you
that
information
if
and
when
it
comes!
Gangplank

Coveted

Miss

Famed

wins
grog
contest
by
a

Newton
Rook
reporting
from
Bilgewater
As
of
early
this
morning,
the
famed
Bilgewater
GrugMug
Grog
Slog
ended
after
an
exhausting
6
hour
final
between
League
Champions
Gangplank
and
Sarah
Fortune
.
The
coveted
Grog
Scab,
a
Bilgewater
title
awarded
to
the
crafter
of
the
most
caustic
drink
known
to
Runeterrans,
has
been
lost
by
the
Saltwater
Scourge
for
the
first
time
in
15
years.
The
GrugMug
Grog
Slog
is
a
yearly
competition
amongst
privateers
looking
to
prove
their
mettle
as
the
hardest
drinkers
on
the
high
seas.
Both
grog-drinkers
and
grog-crafters
alike
convene
at
the
GrugMug
Tavern
to
crown
the
year’s
best
“Scab”
and
“Glug”.
The
Scab
is
awarded
to
the
creator
of
the
strongest,
most
corrosive
grog,
and
the
Glug
is
awarded
to
the
hearty
soul
that
can
drink
the
most
of
it
before
requesting
medical
attention.
Historically,
Gangplank
has
won
the
Scab
title
every
year
since
he
joined
his
father
on
the
Dead
Pool.
He
has
won
despite
constant
rumors
of
foul
play
ranging
from
bribery
of
the
judges
to
illegal
tampering
with
ingredients.
To
date,
however,
no
official
accusations
have
been
levied.
Last
week,
Mog
“Shirt”
Malloy,
Grugmug
proprietor,
expressed
his
view
on
the
matter:
“Nobody
will
officially
accuse
the
Scourge
of
cheating.
Anybody
who
does
just
disappears
quietly!
The
contest
falls
how
the
contest
falls,
no
questions.”
This
year,
Sarah
Fortune
won
the
Scab
title
in
an
unexpected
upset
after
several
tense
stages
of
caustic
tests
and
analysis.
Hundreds
of
Slog
attendees
waited
breathlessly
in
the
tavern
for
the
final
results
as
the
contest
neared
its
end.
The
panel
of
judges,
which
included
Journal
of
Justice
reporter
Captain
Morgan
Rackham,
declared
her
the
winner
when
her
concoction
melted
completely
through
the
pewter
mug,
table,
and
the
floor.
Gangplank’s
recipe,
however,
stopped
just
short
of
eating
through
the
floor,
instead
pooling
in
a
steamy
puddle
upon
the
resin-coated
floorboards.
Witnesses
say
that
when
the
judges
declared
the
winner,
the
room
grew
very
quiet.
Gangplank
stood
staring
at
the
judges
for
a
minute
before
he
pulled
out
his
gun
and
pointed
it
at
one
of
his
own
men.
Before
he
could
fire,
Sarah
Fortune
stepped
in
the
way
and
offered
him
her
grog
supply
if
he
would
let
the
man
live.
“I
can’t
stand
the
stuff
myself
anyway,”
she
was
overheard
saying.
After
a
lengthy
pause,
Gangplank
un-cocked
his
gun
and
declared,
“Bullets
are
getting
costly
lately,”
then
stormed
out
into
the
street
with
his
men
in
tow.
We
caught
up
with
Malloy
for
comment
on
the
surprising
turn
of
events:
“Cut
me
off
at
the
knees
and
call
me
a
yordle
!
I
don’t
think
Gangplank
has
ever
hesitated
to
kill
his
own
men.
I
wonder
if
he’s
getting
soft?
And
the
grog!
Fortune
must’ve
cheated
better
than
him
somehow.
I
don’t
know.
I
don’t
see
it,
I
don’t
care.”
Speculation
has
run
rampant
on
whether
or
not
the
Saltwater
Scourge
has
turned
a
new
leaf
with
his
unprecedented
restraint.
Local
bar
patrons
are
already
laying
odds
on
which
lasts
shorter—Miss
Fortune
allowing
herself
to
be
called
a
“Scab”,
or
Gangplank
being
nice.

decided
to
lead
with
the

article.
Romances

often
require

“I've

there?”
–
coolkirby4
According
to
reports
from
Noxian
authorities,
Veigar
was
amongst
“a
handful”
of
yordles
arrested
for
trading
illegal
goods
in
Noxus.
The
yordles
claimed
to
be
from
a
Bandle
City
trading
organization,
and
they
were
brokering
a
deal
with
a
Noxian
when
they
were
caught.
Noxus
isn’t
renowned
for
its
tolerance
of
yordles,
though,
so
you
might
want
to
take
those
reports
with
a
grain
of
salt.

I'm
curious
what
these
"...expert
safety
practices
of
Noxian
mining
operations..."
are?
Surely
it
was
a
cheap
jab
at
Demacia
because
of
the
cave-in.
I
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
these
practices
would
be
something
along
the
lines
of
putting
collars
on
each
Noxian
citizen
within
a
fairly
large
radius
of
the
mining
sites
and
leashing
them
to
a
pole
and
having
them
watched
like
rabid,
ill-mannered
dogs.
So
I
ask
you
Katarina
to
address
my
personal
conclusion
of
these
practices
you
mentioned
and
what
they
really
were?
Also,
refrain
from
talking
about
your
city-state
and/or
its
people
for
the
duration
of
your
reply,
keep
it
to
the
mining
practices
you
preached
in
the
quote.
I
already
know
of
your
kind's
tenuous
grip
on
reality
when
you
start
thinking
of
your
homeland.”
–
Seth
Vortu
Wow,
that’s
a
bold
letter
to
send
to
one
of
Noxus’
most
eminent
assassins,
Seth.
Nonetheless,
I
delivered
your
query
(at
my
own
peril,
I
might
add)
to
the
Sinister
Blade
in
person.
She
looked
rather
dejected
when
I
found
her,
but
to
my
surprise,
this
letter
seemed
to
bring
her
great
zeal.
“I
do
enjoy
it
when
men
like
you
draw
lines
in
the
sand,
Mr.
Vortu.
There
is
nothing
quite
as
satisfying
as
watching
the
smugness
drain
from
your
faces
when
you
realize
you’ve
picked
a
fight
you
shouldn’t
have.
I
did
not
offer
our
mining
practices
to
you,
and
I
will
refrain
from
nothing.
If
we
were
to
leash
anyone
to
poles
like
dogs,
we
would
not
start
with
Noxians.
Judging
by
your
demeanor,
I
suspect
I
might
have
one
of
your
family
members
lashed
to
a
pole
outside
right
now.
If
you
would
like
to
earn
the
privilege
to
learn
about
Noxian
mining
procedures,
please
visit
the
Du
Couteau
Manor
and
I
will
be
certain
you
find
your
way
to
the
mines.”
“I
have
often
chosen
Vladimir
as
my
champion
to
do
battle
on
the
Fields
of
Justice
,
and
I
am
filled
with
a
morbid
fascination
regarding
his
transfusion...do
individual
champions
have
unique
tasting
blood?
Does
the
dark
blood
of
the
Void
from,
say,
Cho'Gath
taste
different
from
the
chemical-laden
blood
of
Singed
?
Which
champion
would
you
say
is
your
‘favorite’?”
–
RavenTessen
Your
fascination
is
indeed
morbid.
That’s
a
question
I
would
strongly
prefer
not
to
touch
with
a
stick
of
any
length.
Vladimir
seemed
much
more
delighted
with
your
interest.
“The
thought
of
you
there,
fantasizing
about
the
taste
of
blood,
invigorates
me.
I
do
not
drink
it
in
the
conventional
sense;
I
use
it
and
it
fills
me.
Think
of
the
relationship
a
cloud
might
have
with
water.
However,
what
makes
blood
special
is
not
its
actual
taste,
but
the
flavor
of
the
life
force
which
infuses
it.
That
life
force
is
what
I
‘taste’
when
I
use
my
craft.
In
this
way
the
blood
of
Cho’Gath
is
as
different
from
the
blood
of
Singed
as
are
the
two
champions
themselves.
Despite
the
many
flavors,
I
could
not
choose
a
favorite.
Variety,
like
blood,
is
the
spice
of
life!”
