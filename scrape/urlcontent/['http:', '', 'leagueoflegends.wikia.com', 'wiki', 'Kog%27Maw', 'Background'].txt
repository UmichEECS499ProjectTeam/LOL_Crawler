Champion
When
the
prophet
Malzahar
was
reborn
in
Icathia
,
he
was
led
there
by
an
ominous
voice
which
thereafter
anchored
itself
to
his
psyche.
From
within,
this
voice
bestowed
upon
him
terrible
purpose,
and
though
Malzahar
was
no
longer
tormented
by
its
call,
the
voice
did
not
cease
its
unrelenting
summons.
This
baleful
beacon's
gentle
flicker
-
now
fastened
to
Runeterra
-
drew
forth
a
putrid
beast
that
ambled
across
a
threshold
it
did
not
understand,
widening
a
fissure
between
spaces
which
were
never
meant
to
meet.
There
amongst
the
haunting
ruins
of
Icathia,
Kog'Maw
manifested
in
Valoran
with
unsettling
curiosity.
The
spark
which
led
him
to
Runeterra
teased
him
still,
urging
him
gently
towards
Malzahar.
It
also
encouraged
him
to
familiarize
himself
with
his
new
environment,
to
the
stark
horror
of
everything
he
encountered
on
his
journey.
The
enchanting
colors
and
aromas
of
Runeterra
intoxicated
Kog'Maw,
and
he
explored
the
fruits
of
the
strange
world
the
only
way
he
knew
how:
by
devouring
them.
At
first
he
sampled
only
the
wild
flora
and
fauna
he
happened
across.
As
he
traversed
the
parched
Tempest
Flats,
however,
he
came
upon
a
tribe
of
nomads.
Seemingly
unhampered
by
conventional
rules
of
physics,
Kog'Maw
consumed
every
nomad
and
any
obstacles
they
put
in
his
way,
amounting
to
many
times
his
own
mass
and
volume.
The
most
composed
of
his
victims
may
have
had
time
to
wonder
if
this
was
due
to
the
caustic
enzymes
which
stung
the
ground
as
they
dripped
from
his
gaping
mouth,
although
such
musings
were
abruptly
concluded.
When
his
wake
of
catastrophe
reached
the
Institute
of
War
,
an
enthusiastic
Malzahar
greeted
him
with
an
enticing
prospect:
taste
the
best
Runeterra
could
offer...
on
the
Fields
of
Justice
.
"If
that's
just
hungry,
I
don't
want
to
see
angry."

Kog'Maw
was

Kog'Maw
in
Malzahar
Screenshot
Kog'Maw
in-game
Kog'Maw
was
first
featured
in
a
Screenshot
of
Malzahar
,
though
no
further
information
was
given
at
that
time.
Relating
the
Sneak
Peak
screenshot
and
the
Malzahar
screenshot,
however,
and
you
can
see
clear
similarities.

Champion
Sneak
Peek
On
June
18th,
2010
a
new
preview
was
given
by
Pendragon
which
finally
cleared
information
up:
[2]
Kog'Maw
silhouette
Those
of
you
who
were
paying
attention
when
we
released
Malzahar
might
have
noticed
somebody
lurking
in
the
background.
And
today
you
get
to
put
a
name
to
that
face…
err…
mouth.
Meet
Kog’Maw,
Mouth
of
the
Abyss.
Now
many
of
you
have
been
asking
for
more
monsters
in
the
League
of
Legends
lineup,
so
if
you
had
any
doubts
about
whether
or
not
we’re
taking
your
suggestions
to
heart,
this
gentleman…
err…
gentlemouth
should
assuage
those
concerns.
