battle
in
a
5v5
format
on
a
map
called
the
Crystal
Scar
.
Players
were
able
to
play
Dominion
in
a
nearly
complete
state
at
GamesCom
(August
17th-21th,
2011)
in
Europe
and
at
PAX
Prime
(August
26th-28th,

North
America.
A
limited
time
open
beta
began
on
Sept
21th,
2011
and
lasted
approximately
two
hours.
Another
limited
beta
testing
started
on
September

Development
Main
article:
Dominion/Development
Dominion
was
officially
announced
on
the
main
website
as
the
new
capture-and-hold
game
mode
on
League
of
Legends
on
Thursday,
August
4th,
2011.
Even
though
there
was
no
information
about
this
new
mode
before
the
announcement
there
was
a
large
build-up
for
it
on
the
Kalamanda
storyline
on
the
Journal
of
Justice
issues.
Main
differences
The
Dominion
game
mode
allows
for
a
fast-paced
match
averaging
15
to
20
minutes
involving
many
small
skirmishes.
There
are
several
differences
from
the
other
game
modes:
Champions
start
at
level
3
with
1375
gold.
There
is
a
constant
aura
on
this
map
granting
all
champions
adjusted
stats:
Mana
regeneration
bonus,
equal
to
2%
mana
regeneration
per
1%
of
missing
mana.
7.2
experience
gained
per
second.
Fury
generation
is
increased
by
33%
for
Tryndamere
and
Renekton
and
by
25%
for
Shyvana
.
Energy
regeneration
per
second
is
increased
by
2
(10
per
5
seconds).
Increased
gold
gain
over
time.
(26
gold
per
5
seconds)
Reduced
gold
gain
by
killing
champions.
Increased
gold
gain
by
killing
minions
.
The
Recall
spell
is
replaced
by
Enhanced
Recall
that
requires
only
4.5
channeling
time
instead
of
the
original
8.
Respawn
times
are
reduced.
[2]
Gameplay
Dominion
is
a
capture-and-hold
game
mode
where
two
teams
of
five
players
compete
on
the
Crystal
Scar
Field
of
Justice
to
destroy
the
enemy
nexus
.
The
nexus
is
untargetable
and
has
500
life
points.
These
life
points
can
only
be
diminished
by
controlling
more
Capture
points
than
the
enemy
team:
the
more
points
you
control,
the
faster
life
points
are
lost
by
the
enemy
nexus.
When
both
teams
have
the
same
amount
of
capture
points,
neither
nexus
will
be
damaged.
Killing
an
enemy
champion
also
reduces
their
nexus'
HP
by
2.
The
nexus'
HP
will
stop
depleting
life
by
champion
kills
once
it
reaches
100
HP
to
avoid
victory
by
"ninja
capping"
(capturing
points
just
to
deplete
the
health
of
the
nexus
instantly)
or
by
"winning
kill"
(associating
victory
by
finishing
off
enemy
champions).
Capture
points
Main
article:
Capture
point
There
are
five
capture
points
in
Dominion
which
start
out
as
neutral
points
on
the
map
that
players
must
capture.
The
capture
points
must
be
captured
by
right-clicking
on
the
capture
points'
tower.
Once
the
player's
Champion
is
within
range
of
the
tower,
he/she
will
begin
channeling
for
a
set
amount
of
time
to
capture
the
control
point.
The
more
Champions
that
are
channeling,
the
faster
the
control
point
is
captured.
When
a
point
has
already
been
captured
by
an
opposing
team
you
will
need
to
channel
twice:
once
to
make
it
neutral
and
once
more
to
capture
it
for
your
team.
If
a
captured
point
is
neighboring
enemy
capture
point,
two
minion
spawn
points
behind
it
will
start
spawning
minion
waves,
in
the
formation
of
two
regular
minions
plus
one
super
minion
,
alongside
the
outer
ring
to
contend
against
the
enemy
minion
wave
and
neutralize
the
enemy
capture
point
once
they
reach
there.
Any
minion
in
Dominion
would
not
travel
beyond
the
neighboring
capture
point,
which
is
their
programmed
destination.
If
there
is
no
enemy
unit
around
or
the
capture
point
has
already
been
captured,
they
will
disappear
at
the
destination.
Buffs
Main
article:
Buff
There
is
a
set
of
buffs
exclusive
to
Dominion:
Greater
Relics,
Health
Relics,
Speed
Shrines,
and
Capture
Quests.
Greater
Relics
are
consumable
resources
located
in
the
middle
of
the
map
that
yield
an
individual
benefit
and
respawn
at
fixed
intervals.
Health
Relics
are
items
that
provide
champions
using
them
with
an
instant
burst
of
HP,
mana
and
fury.
These
were
placed
to
counter
the
advantage
that
sustainable
champions
had.
Speed
Shrines
provide
a
short
bonus
to
any
champion
who
enters
their
sphere
of
influence
and
cannot
be
exhausted.
Additionally,
after
successfully
completing
a
capture
quest,
the
entire
team
(minus
those
presently
dead)
is
granted
"Mark
of
the
Conqueror",
which
grants
10%
increased
damage.
Items
Main
article:
Crystal
Scar
Dominion
mode
features
unique
items
to
complement
the
new
fast-paced
gameplay
and
to
supplement
items
from
the
Classic
mode
which
are
not
available
in
Dominion.
All
champions
have
had
their
recommended
items
tailor-made
for
Dominion,
making
it
easy
for
players
to
adapt
their
builds.
Ionic
Spark
,
previously
only
available
in
Dominion,
was
made
available
in
Classic
as
of
patch
V1.0.0.132
(it
has
now
been
removed
and
replaced
in
both
classic
and
dominion).
Spells
Main
article:
Dominion
spells
Dominion
mode
featured
new
Summoner
Spells
to
accommodate
the
new
gameplay.
As
there
will
be
no
Turrets
in
Dominion
and
there
are
speed
boost
shrines
the
summoner
spells
Fortify
and
Teleport
with
their
respective
masteries
will
be
replaced
by
Garrison
and
Promote
.
Promote
has
been
made
available
for
Classic
mode
in
patch
V1.0.0.129
,
whilst
Garrison
is
still
Dominion-only
spell.
[3]
(Promote
was
later
removed
from
the
game
and
replaced
with
the
item
Banner
of
Command.)
Quest
A
quest
is
issued
to
both
teams
after
the
5
minute
mark.
This
involves
capturing
an
enemy-held
point
and
defending
a
capture
point
you
control.
Completing
these
quests
will
end
the
quest
set,
sap
20
enemy
nexus
health,
and
bestow
a
buff
"Mark
of
the
Conqueror,"
granting
10%
bonus
damage.
A
new
quest
is
issued
5
minutes
after
the
completion
of
the
first.
Fog
of
War
The
outer
track
is
almost
entirely
revealed
and
is
not
in
a
fog
of
war,
with
the
very
important
and
notable
exception
of
four
thin
aisles
between
the
ramps
by
either
spawn
point
and
the
enshrouded
center
area.
With
care,
these
allow
summoners
the
option
to
mask
their
position
in
order
to
appear
unexpectedly
somewhere
on
the
map,
to
aid
a
tower
capture
or
initiate
an
ambush.
There
is
no
vision
of
the
Health
Relics
by
each
tower,
unless
friendly
minions
have
spawned.
In
addition,
the
middle
Greater
Relics
are
visible
to
all
champions,
though
the
entirety
of
the
Greater
Relic
area
is
not
revealed.
Scoring
system
Because
capture
and
hold
is
not
meant
to
be
kill
based,
Riot
introduced
a
scoring
system,
not
to
be
confused
with
the
health
of
nexus
.
Though
kills
are
still
there,
they
are
not
as
significant
as
in
Classic
mode.
However,
the
final
score
does
not
necessarily
represent
a
player's
overall
performance.
Since
any
action
can
stack
the
score,
it
is
merely
telling
how
active
the
player
is.
A
player
can
be
strategically
passive
but
still
contributes
a
great
part
in
their
victory.
Also
players
who
lane
by
the
bottom
capture
points
,
namely
Quarry
and
Boneyard,
usually
accumulate
the
lowest
score
within
the
team
if
they
seldom
leave
the
post.
On
October
14th,
2011,
Riot
expressed
the
necessity
to
adjust
the
scoring
system
to
better
reflect
a
player's
actual
contribution
to
the
team.
Defending
owned
capture
points
or
killing
enemy
minions
now
grants
more
points
than
before.
