The
Shop
is
an
area
in
all
League
of
Legends
maps
where
Summoners
can
purchase
items
for
their
champions
.
Every
shop
is
located
near
each
team's
spawn
pool.
A
summoner
can
access
the
shop
either
by
clicking
it
with
the
mouse
cursor
or
by
using
the
default
Hotkey
,
"
P
".
A
champion
must
be
in
proximity
of
the
shop
for
the
summoner
to
obtain
items.
On
Summoner's
Rift
This
proximity
includes
most
of
the
Spawn
Pool
and
extends
slightly
out
from
it.

Organization
Items
are
organized
first
into
five
categories:
Defense,
Attack,
Magic,
Movement,
and
Consumables.
The
first
three
are
broken
down
into
further
categories
based
on
the
statistics
the
items
have.
Items
can
be
sorted
under
multiple
categories
if
it
contains
that
category's
statistic.
For
example:
The
Bloodthirster
would
appear
under
both
Damage
and
Life
steal
in
the
Attack
category
for
its
damage
and
life
steal
effects.
Items
in
each
category
are
sorted
from
the
cheapest
price
to
the
most
expensive.
The
items
are
organized
as
the
following:
Consumables
Defense
Health
Armor
Magic
Resist
Health
Regen
Tenacity
Attack
Damage
Critical
Strike
Attack
Speed
Life

Magic

does
not
cover:

,

tab.
