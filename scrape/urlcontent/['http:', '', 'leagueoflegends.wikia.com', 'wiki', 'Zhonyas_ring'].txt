Zhonya's
Ring
was
an
advanced
item
in
League
of
Legends
.
It
was
broken
up
into
two
different
items,
Zhonya's
Hourglass
and
Rabadon's
Deathcap
,
in
V1.0.0.108
.
Zhonya's
Hourglass
was
given
the
2.5
second
invulnerability
active
(defensive
aspect),
while
Rabadon's
Deathcap
was
given
the
ability
power
passive
(offensive).
The
reason
for
Zhonya's
break-up
into
two
items
was
because
the
item
"gave
ultimate
offense
and
ultimate
defense
for
casters"
which
was
deemed
too
strong.

Items
Wooglet's
Witchcap
has
similar
functionality
to
Zhonya's
Ring
,
though
it
grants
less
ability
power
and
more
armor
.
Trivia

to
the
Journal
of
Justice
(Issue
21;
Inside
the
Vault)
,
Zhonya's
Ring
was
stolen.
This
is
the
reason
why
it
is
unavailable
for
use.
