This
article
is
about
the
summoner's
spells.
For
champion's
spells,
see
ability
.
Summoner
Spells
are
abilities
that
a
summoner
can
use
to
assist
their
champion
on
the
Fields
of
Justice
.
They
are
chosen
in
Champion
Select
before
the
start
of
the
game.
Each
player
is
allowed
two
summoner
spells
chosen
from
a
list.
Summoner
spells
can
be
used
in
game
to
aid
a
player’s
champion
in
various
ways
as
each
spell
has
a
unique
effect.
Some
summoner
spells
increase
in
effectiveness
relative
to
your
champion's
level,
but
many
provide
the
same
effect
at
champion
level
1
as
they
do
at
champion
level
18.
They
do
not
have
any
cost
other
than
their
cooldown.

Spell
Unlocking
and
Cooldowns
Summoner
Spell
Teleport
The
number
of
spells
that
are
available
to
a
player
are
determined
by
their
summoner
level
.
At
summoner
level
one,
a
player
begins
with
six
spells
to
choose
from.
Then
as
a
summoner
reaches
new
levels,
he
or
she
will
unlock
new
spells
up
to
level
twelve.

Summoner
Spells
and
Champion
Level
During
combat
the
spells
(
Barrier
,
Heal
,
Ignite
,
and
Smite
)
gain
power
with
champion
level
.
The
other
spells
have
the
same
power
throughout
the
entire
battle.
While
in
combat
the
spells
are
bound
by
the
same
rules
as
the
champion
skills,
however,
Flash
and
Teleport
are
the
only
summoner
spells
that
cannot
be
used
while
silenced
or
stunned.
Reducing
Summoner
Spell
Cooldowns
In
season
4,
there
are
only
two
ways
to
reduce
the
cooldown
of
summoner
spells.
The
first
one
is
the
enchantment
Distortion
for
boots
which
reduces
the
cooldown
of
Ghost
,
Teleport
and
Flash
by
25%.
The
second
one
is
the
mastery
Summoner's
Insight
which
reduce
the
cooldown
of
all
summoner
spells
by
4%
,
7%
or
10%
dependent
on
the
amount
of
points
put
into
it.
Summoner
Spells
and
Game
Modes
Currently
there
are
three
game
modes
in
League
of
Legends:
Classic
,
Dominion
and
ARAM
.
Due
to
the
different
characteristics
of
each
game
mode,
some
summoner
spells
are
excluded
from
a
mode
while
other
spells
are
available
specifically
for
a
particular
mode.
And
there
are
also
common
summoner
spells
which
are
available
in
all
modes.
The
current
set
of
summoner
spells
available
in
Classic
mode
are
the
same
for
Dominion
with
the
exceptions
of
Garrison
and
Teleport
,
which
replace
one
another.
The
following
table
shows
what
modes
are
available
for
each
spell:
Spell
Classic

Notes
In-game
Summoner
Spell
icon
tooltips
always
show
the
base
cooldown,
unaffected
by
masteries.
The
timer
visible
on
the
icon
after
the
spell
is
used
shows
the
actual
cooldown
remaining.
Teleport's
cooldown
upon
being
canceled
is
always
180
seconds.
Revive
has
an
in-game
tooltip
error
where
it
says
it
has
a
510
second
cooldown
instead
of
540.
Promote
was
previously
removed
because
it
was
too
strong,
but
it
was
since
balanced
and
made
available
in
all
game
modes
until
it
was
again
removed
for
Season
3.
The
active
effect
returned
as
an
item
.
