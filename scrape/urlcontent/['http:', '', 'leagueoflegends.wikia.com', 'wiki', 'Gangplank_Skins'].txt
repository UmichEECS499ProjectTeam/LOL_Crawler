Trivia
Gangplank
was
designed
by
Fantasyworld
,
who
has
since
left
Riot.
Gangplank
is
voiced
by
Dennis
Collins
Johnson
,
Who
also
voices
Heimerdinger
and
Taric
.
When
Gangplank
triggers
a
critical
hit,
he
will
use
his
pistol
for
the
autoattack
instead
of
his
sword.
The
final
boss
of
Donkey
Kong
Country
King.K.Rool
is
fought
on
his
ship,
the
"Gangplank
Galleon".
During
the
battle
he
causes
cannonballs
to
fall
from
the
sky.
Gangplank's
skill
Parrrley
is
spelled
with
3
r's
(Parrrley),
a
reference
to
popular
conception
of
pirates
speech.
Somewhat
ironically,
the
term
parley
is
used
to
describe
a
diplomatic
discussion
between
enemies
in
regards
to
forming
an
agreement
or
truce.
"Parley"
is
also
a
running
gag
in
the
Pirates
of
the
Caribbean
franchise.
Gangplank's
"Yarr!
I'm
a
mighty
pirate!"
buff
may
be
a
reference
to
Guybrush
Threepwood's
catch
phrase
from
the
Monkey
Island
series.
The
Pirate
and
Ninja
buffs
are
corresponding
references
to
the
Pirates
vs.
Ninjas
meme.
Gangplank
was
the
only
champion
in
League
of
Legend
capable
of
denying,
an
act
of
killing
a
friendly
minion
to
rob
enemies
of
last-hit
gold
bonuses.
The
ability
to
deny
allied
minions
was
removed
in
v1.0.0.116
.
His
lore
might
be
referred
to
the
Dragon
Highlord
Duulket
Ariakas
from
the
Dragonlance
Chronicles.
Both
had
fathers
that
are
unforgiving
towards
their
son,
both
stabbed
their
fathers
in
the
back
then
claimed
their
prized
possession
and
both
their
fathers
were
"never
prouder
than
the
day
he
was
stabbed
in
the
back."
NA
user
SantiagoBR
gave
birth
to
the
"But
I
ate
some
oranges
and
it
was
k"
meme.
His
appearance
is
similar
to
Redden
Alt
Mer,
an
airship
captain/mercenary
from
the
books
"The
voyage
of
the
Jerle
Shannara"
By
Terry
Brooks.
Miss
Fortune
may
also
be
based
off
his
sister
Rue
Meridian
who
is
visually
the
same
and
"is
capable
of
charming
any
man".
Gangplank
got
a
new
German
voice
in
2013.
Quotes
Gangplank's
quote
"
Yohoho,
and
a
bottle
of
rum!
"
comes
directly
from
the
book
The
Treasure
Island
.
Skins
Spooky
Gangplank
is
probably
a
reference
to
the
nautical
folklore
of
The
Flying
Dutchman
.
Although
Sailor
Gangplank
appeared
in
the
store
on
October
5,
2010,
the
skin
was
not
officially
released
until
January
10,
2011.
The
Minuteman
Gangplank
and
Waterloo
Miss
Fortune
skins
both
reference
historic
periods
of
war.
Like
Janna
,
Gangplank
is
another
champion
to
have
his
in-game
model
redone
based
off
the
Chinese
Splash
Art.
Special
Forces
Gangplank
may
be
a
possible
reference
to
the
movies
Expendables
1
&
2.
Special
Forces
Gangplank
is
a
commemorative
skin
created
to
celebrate
the
launch
of
League
of
Legend's
Brazilian
servers.
Before
its
release,
he
used
to
eat
pineapples
and
bananas
instead
of
oranges.
Special
Forces
Gangplank
seems
to
be
heavily
inspired
by
the
Brazillian
film
Elite
Squad
.
In
the
background
of
the
Special
Forces
Gangplank
Skin,
one
can
see
Miss
Fortune
and
possibly
Caitlyn
and
Talon
.
