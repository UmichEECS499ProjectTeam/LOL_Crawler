Trivia
Pantheon
was
designed
by
Shurelia
.
Pantheon's
name
is
directly
from
the
Greek
word
'Πάνθεον',
referring
to
the
collection
of
gods
in
ancient
Greek
mythology.
Pantheon's
dance
is
a
reference
to
the
dance
from
the
"Jailhouse
Rock"
music
video.
A
side-by-side
comparison
can
be
seen
here.
Pantheon's
lore
had
previously
stated
that
he
was
of
the
tribe
"Stanpar"
(an
anagram
of
"Spartan").
But
when
Leona
was
introduced
to
the
game,
his
lore
had
been
re-written
to
replace
all
mentions
of
his
tribe's
name
"Stanpar"
with
"Rakkor."
Pantheon
(sharing
with
Master
Yi
)
is
the
Champion
with
the
highest
Base
Movement
Speed
in
the
game,
being
355.
Quotes
Many
of
Pantheon's
quotes
reference
the
movie
300
.
Pantheon's
taunt
references
a
scene
in
which
King
Leonidas
kicks
a
Persian
messenger
into
a
well.
Pantheon's
jokes
are
a
reference
to
when
King
Leonidas
asks
his
Spartan
soldiers
what
their
professions
are.
One
of
his
quotes,
"They
will
not
enjoy
this!"
refers
to
when
the
Queen
Gorgo
kills
Theron
during
the
council
meeting
near
the
end
of
the
movie.
Skins
Pantheon's
classic
appearance
is
most
likely
inspired
by
the
Spartans.
The
Chinese
artwork
of
"Classic
Skin
2"
slightly
shows
Pantheon's
face.
Myrmidon
Pantheon
is
a
reference
to
Myrmidons
,
who
were
among
the
fiercest
warriors
in
all
of
Greece,
led
by
Achilles
in
Homer's
Iliad
.
Perseus
Pantheon
skin
is
a
reference
to
Perseus
from
the
Greek
mythology.
The
picture
on
his
Perseus
shield
resembles
the
head
of
Cassiopeia
(more
specifically,
the
head
of
her
Classic
skin).
This
is
most
likely
an
allusion
towards
reflecting
the
gaze
of
Medusa,
seeing
as
both
Medusa
and
Cassiopeia
have
a
Petrifying
Gaze
.
Cassiopeia
is
also
the
name
of
a
queen
in
Perseus's
adventure
who
disrupts
his
adventure.
Ruthless
Pantheon
is
a
reference
to
the
He-Man
cartoon
series.
Full
Metal
Pantheon
was
given
away
during
a
G4/X-Play
Facebook
and
Twitter
event,
with
a
limited
number
of
skin
codes
released.
Pantheon
shares
a
Full
Metal
theme
with
Rammus
and
Jayce
Glaive
Warrior
Pantheon
is
a
commemorative
skin
created
to
celebrate
the
launch
of
League
of
Legend's
Romanian
servers.
This
skin
is
an
homage
to
the
Dacian
soldiers
of
ancient
Romania
who
halted
Roman
conquest
of
the
region.
His
shield
sports
the
Dacian
dragon
[1]
Relations
Pantheon
was
childhood
friends
with
Leona
.
