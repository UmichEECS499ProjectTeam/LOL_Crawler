As

a
spectacular
conclusion,
the
competition
is
fiercer
than
ever.
To
commemorate
every
action-packed
moment,
we’ve
outfitted
Riven

a
heavy
suit
of
armor,
new
spell
effects,
and
a

befitting
a
truly
determined
contender.

Closing
the
Curtain
Announced
by
Average
Gatsby
[3]
It
was
early
in
the
morning
when
the
first
enthusiastic
League
of
Legends
fans
turned
out
to
line
up
for
the
World
Finals
at
USC’s
Galen
Center
in
Los
Angeles,
California.
By
the
time
the
doors
opened,
fans
circled
nearly
the
entire
perimeter
of
the
venue,
ready
to
cheer
on
the
showdown
between
the
Taipei
Assassins
and
Korea’s
Azubu
Frost.
Nearly
8,000
anxious
spectators
watched
the
two
championship
contenders
square
off.
Before
the
match
for
the
$1
million
first-place
prize
began,
Phreak
and
Rivington
hosted
an
hour-long
pregame
show
featuring
an
all-star
game,
trophy
presentation,
and
orchestra
performance.
The
atmosphere
was
electric
as
djWheat
introduced
the
teams
and
the
Finals
got
underway.
Triumph
of
the
Underdogs
The
final
match
between
Azubu
Frost
and
Taipei
Assassins
(TPA)
was
a
best-of-five
series
with
the
winner
taking
home
the
title
of
Season
Two
World
Champion
and
a
$1
million
grand
prize.
TPA
announced
their
presence
with
authority
as
the
first
game
started,
but
Azubu
Frost
turned
the
tables
in
mid-game
with
several
impressive
team
fight
victories.
MVP
Rapidstar
snowballed
after
multiple
kills,
including
a
quadrakill
as
Karthus.
Watching
from
the
front
row,
Team
SoloMid’s
Reginald
commented,
“TPA
played
phenomenal
…
and
I
felt
that
they
got
complacent
during
the
match.”
After
dropping
the
first
game
of
the
match,
TPA
had
to
dig
themselves
out
of
an
early
hole
against
a
team
that
was
heavily
favored
going
into
the
championship.
They
didn’t
disappoint
the
huge
number
of
fans
they
acquired
over
the
course
of
their
impressive
run,
and
soon
the
crowd
was
boisterously
cheering
for
the
underdogs.
Between
games,
TPA’s
manager,
Erica
Tseng,
jokingly
told
me,
“They
play
better
when
they
are
hungry.
That’s
why
I
starve
them
before
matches.”
Whatever
her
secret
is,
it
paid
off.
TPA
was
certainly
hungry
to
win,
and
rallied
to
close
out
a
commanding
victory
in
their
second
game.
With
the
momentum
swinging
back
in
their
favor,
TPA
managed
to
take
the
next
two
games
handily,
winning
the
series
three
games
to
one.
Against
all
odds,
the
dark
horse
Assassins
claimed
the
Season
Two
World
Championship
over
Korea’s
Azubu
Frost.
The
Summoner’s
Cup,
Motorcycles,
and
All
the
Foods
After
a
hard-earned
victory,
djWheat
introduced
the
Taipei
Assassins
as
the
Season
Two
World
Champions.
Co-Founders
Marc
Merrill
and
Brandon
Beck
addressed
the
victors
with
heartfelt
acknowledgements
and
awarded
them
the
Summoner’s
Cup.
TPA
will
be
the
second
team
to
have
their
name
immortalized
on
the
base
of
the
Cup
alongside
Season
One
Champion
Fnatic
MSI.
With
a
huge
such
a
huge
prize
purse
in
hand,
the
press
fished
for
answers
to
the
classic
question:
“What
would
you
do
with
$1,000,000?”
Stanley
and
Lilballz
each
expressed
their
excitement
at
thoughts
of
purchasing
a
new
motorcycle.
For
others
on
the
team,
the
only
certainty
was
some
Taiwanese
fine
dining.
Stanley
stated,
“I
want
to
be
like
Bebe
and
eat
all
the
Taiwanese
food.”
Most
importantly,
the
team
will
return
to
Taiwan
as
heroes
and
ambassadors
for
eSports.
Congratulations
to
our
Season
Two
World
Champions,
Taipei
Assassins
!
