apply
other
on-hit
effects
and
can
critically
strike

normal.
As
with
most
on-hit
physical
damage,
the
bonus
damage
from
Siphoning
Strike
will
apply
life
steal
.
Critical
strikes
modify
Siphoning
Strike's
base
bonus
damage

not
the
bonus
damage
from
the
stacks.
The
bonus
damage
will
affect
structures.
The
enhanced
attack

not
be
dodged
.
