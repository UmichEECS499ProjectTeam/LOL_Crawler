Hecarim,
the
Shadow
of
War
is
a
champion
in
League
of
Legends
.
[1]
Abilities
Warpath
Hecarim
ignores
unit
collision
and
gains
bonus
attack
damage
equal
to

of
his
bonus
movement
speed.
Ability
Details
Warpath
is
a
self-buff
.
Additional
Information:
Warpath's
attack
damage
bonus
will
adjust
itself
to
any
temporary
movement
speed
buffs
Hecarim
receives,
such
as
those
from
Talisman
of
Ascension
,
Sona's
Song
of
Celerity
,
Ghost
or
Speed
Shrines
in
Dominion.
This
also
can
be
detrimental
-
Warpath
will
be
adversely
affected
by
slowing
effects,
such
as
from
Randuin's
Omen
or
Nasus's
Wither
.
However,
Hecarim
will
not
dip
below
his
regular
attack
damage
if
he
is
slowed
below
his
base
movement
speed,
as
Warpath
only
counts
his
bonus
movement
speed.
Hecarim
has
no
unit
collision
of
his
own,
and
does
not
block
other
units'
pathing.
Potentially,
this
can
have
the
dubious
effect
of
allowing
him
to
completely
obscure
the
click
area
of
a
minion
or
smaller
allied
champion
with
his
large
hitbox.
Rampage
Range:
350
Cooldown:

Cost:

/

/

Mana
Active:
Hecarim
cleaves
nearby
enemies,
dealing
physical
damage.
This
skill
deals
only
66%
damage
to
minions
and
monsters.
If
Hecarim
damages
at
least
one
enemy
unit
with
this
attack,
he
gains
a
stack
of
Rampage
for
8
seconds,
reducing
the
base
cooldown
of
this
ability
by
1
second.
This
effect
can
stack
up
to
2
times.
Physical
damage:

Ability
Details
Rampage
is
a
point
blank
area
of
effect
ability.
Applies
spell
effects
as
an
area
of
effect
ability.
Spell
vamp
is
reduced
to
one-third
effectiveness.
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
will
apply
a
15%
slow.
Spell
shields
will
block
the
damage.
Additional
Information:
Rampage
has
no
cast
time
and
does
not
interrupt
Hecarim's
previous
orders.
Rampage
stacks
reduce
the
ability's
base
cooldown,
distinct
from
the
usual
flat
cooldown
reduction
of
abilities
such
as
Undertow
and
Arcane
Mastery
.
This
means
cooldown
reduction
from
items,
runes
or
masteries
is
applied
after
the
reduction
from
any
Rampage
stacks.
This
makes
Rampage's
minimum
cooldown
1.2
seconds
at
40%
cooldown
reduction
and
2
Rampage
stacks,
instead
of
0.4
seconds.

himself
with
the
spirit
of
dread
for
4
seconds,

all
enemies
within
its
reach.
Additionally,
Hecarim
is
healed
for
20%
of
the

enemies
within
the
area.

Ability
Details
Spirit
of
Dread
is
a
point
blank
area
of
effect
ability.
Applies
spell
effects
as
an
area
of
effect
ability.
Spell
vamp
is
reduced
to
one-third
effectiveness.
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
will
apply
a
15%
slow.
Magic
damage
will
be
mitigated
by
Black
Shield
and
Lifeline
.
Spell
shields
will
not
block
the
ability.
Additional
Information:
Spirit
of
Dread
has
no
cast
time
and
does
not
interrupt
Hecarim's
previous
orders.
Spirit
of
Dread
will
heal
Hecarim
for
damage
from
any
source
from
any
enemy
whatsoever,
including
basic
attacks
,
abilities
,
items
,
and
summoner
spells
sourced
from
himself,
allied
champions,
allied
structures,
minions
and
even
neutral
monsters
.
The
sole
exception
to
this
is
for
abilities
that
cost
health
-
Hecarim
will
not
heal
if
an
enemy
expends
health
to
cast
a
spell
within
Spirit
of
Dread's
radius.
Spirit
of
Dread's
minion
healing
cap
is
based
on
total
healing
from
all
minions.
This
means
that
Hecarim
can
only
be
healed
for
up
to
60/90/120/150/180
health
regardless
of
how
many
minions
are
affected
by
the
spell.
Devastating
Charge
Cooldown:
24
/
22
/

/

/

Cost:
60
Mana
Active:
Hecarim
gains
75%
movement
speed
over
the
course
of
3
seconds,
starting
with
initial
25%
upon
cast,
and
ending
one
second
afterward.
While
Hecarim
is
charging,
he
gains
150
extra
attack
range
(325
total).
His
next
attack
knocks
the
target
back,
dealing
physical
damage
based
on
how
far
Hecarim
has
traveled
during
Devastating
Charge's
duration.
If
Hecarim's
target
is
beyond
narrow
terrain,
Hecarim
will
leap
over
the
terrain
to
his
target.
Minimum
physical
damage:
40
/

/

/

(+
100%
bonus

Ability
Details
Devastating
Charge
is
a
self-buff
autoattack
modifier
ability.
The
triggering
attack
will
apply
other
on-hit
effects
as
normal
but
cannot
critically
strike.
As
with
most
onhit
physical
damage,
the
bonus
damage
from
Devastating
Charge
will
apply
life
steal
.
Devastating
Charge's
bonus
damage
will
affect
structures.
PENDING
FOR
TEST
Devasting
Charge's
relationship
with
dodge
,
parry
,
block
and
blind
has
yet
to
be
tested.
Spell
shields
will
block
the
enhanced
autoattack.
Additional
Information:
Devastating
Charge
has
no
cast
time
and
does
not
interrupt
Hecarim's
previous
orders.
Devastating
Charge
resets
Hecarim's
autoattack
timer
on
cast.
Devastating
Charge's
cooldown
begins
on
cast,
not
when
the
buff
expires.
Unusually
for
a
movement
speed
-increasing
ability,
the
percentage
movement
speed
bonuses
provided
by
Devastating
Charge
are
applied
multiplicatively
and
not
additively.
For
example,
the
ability
in
tandem
with
a
Trinity
Force
,
Ghost
and
no
other
modifiers
will
result
in
a
net
movement
speed
modifier
of
100%
×
(8%
+
27%)
×
175%
=
236%
instead
of
210%.
Onslaught
of
Shadows
Range:
1000
Cooldown:
140
/
120
/
100
Cost:
100
Mana
Active:
Hecarim
summons
spectral
riders
and
charges
forward
with
them
in
a
line,
dealing
magic
damage
to
enemies
in
their
path.
Enemies
within
range
of
where
Hecarim
stops
will
flee
in
terror
for
1
second.
The
wave
of
spectral
riders
will
travel
the
maximum
distance
possible
in
the
direction
of
the
cast,
regardless
of
where
Hecarim
himself
stops.
Magic
damage:
150
/
250
/
350
(+
100%
AP)
Ability
Details
Onslaught
of
Shadows
is
a
ground
target
area
of
effect
dash
with
a
linear
pass
through
skillshot
component.
Applies
spell
effects
as
an
area
of
effect
ability.
Spell
vamp
is
reduced
to
one-third
effectiveness.
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
will
apply
a
15%
slow.
Magic
damage
will
be
mitigated
by
Black
Shield
and
Lifeline
.
Spell
shields
will
block
the
fear,
but
do
not
block
the
riders'
damage.
Additional
Information:
Onslaught
of
Shadows'
flee
will
only
be
applied
to
enemies
near
Hecarim
when
he
finishes
his
charge.
It
is
not
applied
to
enemies
that
are
only
hit
by
the
riders.
This
is
not
conversely
true
-
enemies
who
are
feared
by
Hecarim
will
always
receive
the
damage
as
well.
Onslaught
of
Shadows'
flee
is
distinct
from
the
usual
fear
in
that
affected
units
will
always
travel
away
from
Hecarim
for
its
duration,
and
it
has
a
different
Loss
of
Control
Indicator
icon
to
show
this.
The
flee
is
dynamic,
meaning
that
the
affected
target
will
continue
running
away
from
Hecarim,
even
as
he
continues
to
move
himself,
allowing
some
degree
of
control
over
where
affected
units
will
run.
