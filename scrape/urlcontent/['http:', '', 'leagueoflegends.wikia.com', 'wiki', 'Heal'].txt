Strategy
This
spell
can
be
used
to
save
a
life
when
low
on
health
and
under
attack.
It
is
commonly
used
to
get
an
early
first
blood
by
healing
oneself
for
more
than
one's
opponent
expects.
It
is
also
a
skill
used
for
"baiting",
where
you
make
your
champion
appear
weaker
than
it
actually
is,
to
lure
your
enemies
out
of
position
or
to
get
them
to
tower
dive
you.
A
similar
baiting
tactic
is
also
commonly
used
with
Barrier
.
Notes
Heal
applies
a
35
second
debuff
that
reduces
all
subsequent
Summoner
Heal

from
your
own,
by
50%.
This
debuff
does
not
affect
