Lore
Mogron
Pass
during
the
Rune
Wars.
The
Rune
Wars
Until
only
twenty
years
ago,
Runeterra
was
on
a
collision
course
with
disaster.
As
quickly
as
Runeterra’s
denizens
would
band
together
in
ancient
times
as
tribes,
opposing
tribes
would
war
to
settle
their
disputes.
No
matter
the
era,
the
preferred
choice
of
warfare
has
always
been
magical.
Armies
would
be
enhanced
or
decimated
by
spell
and
rune
alike.
Champions
made
the
most
of
magical
items
forged
for
them
as
they
led
or
supported
armies.
Summoners
–
often
the
de
facto
leaders
of
Valoran’s
political
forces
–
would
unleash
mighty
magical
powers
directly
against
foes
and
their
holdings
with
little
regard
for
consequence.
With
such
an
abundance
of
raw
magical
power
at
their
disposal,
there
was
little
motivation
for
summoners
to
explore
more
environmentally-friendly
forms
of
warfare.
Within
the
last
two
hundred
years,
however,
the
dangers
of
unchecked
magical
warfare
began
to
expose
the
fragility
of
Runeterra
to
everyone
residing
in
Valoran.
The
last
two
Rune
Wars
drastically
altered
the
geophysical
landscape
of
Valoran,
even
after
magical
energy
was
focused
on
restoring
it.
Violent
earthquakes
and
horrific
magically-fueled
storms
made
life
on
Valoran
challenging,
even
before
factoring
in
the
horror
of
warfare
on
the
populace.
It
was
theorized
that
another
unchecked
Rune
War
would
tear
the
world
asunder.
The
League
of
Legends
The
Institute
of
War
As
a
direct
response
to
the
world’s
growing
physical
and
political
instability,
Valoran’s
key
magicians
–
including
many
powerful
summoners
–
came
to
the
conclusion
that
conflicts
needed
to
be
resolved
in
a
controllable
and
systemic
way.
They
formed
an
organization
called
the
League
of
Legends
,
whose
purpose
was
to
oversee
the
orderly
resolution
of
political
conflict
in
Valoran.
Housed
in
the
Institute
of
War,
the
League
would
be
given
the
authority
by
Valoran’s
political
entities
to
govern
the
outcomes
of
the
organized
conflict
they
would
administer.
Races
Valoran
is
home
to
many
denizens.
Most
of
which
are
humans
but
there
are
other
races
aswell:
Yordles:
Small,
bipedal
people
with
a
wide
variety
of
skin
&
hair
color
and
are
very
small
in
stature.
Males
are
more
commonly
covered
in
hair
than
females.
Marai:
A
sea-dwelling
race
resembling
merpeople.
They
cannot
breathe
air
and
are
more
fish-like
in
appearance.
Another
sea-dwelling
race
that
seems
to
be
cross
between
a
yordle
and
an
amphibian
also
exists.
However,
they
seem
to
have
disappeared.
Trolls:
Grotesque
creatures
that
commonly
inhabit
the
Freljord
.
Most
are
blue-skinned
and
live
in
tribes.
Ursine:
Bears
that
can
speak
the
human
tongue.
They
can
only
be
found
in
the
Freljord.
Iceborn:
An
ancient
race
of
humans
with
the
power
to
control
ice.
Thought
to
have
been
extinct
until
Lissandra
was
revealed.
Darkins:
A
demon-like,
winged
humanoid
race.
There
are
only
5
in
existence
but
only
Aatrox
has
been
revealed.
Undead:
An
abomination
of
a
race,
created
when
the
barrier
between
life
and
death
was
shattered.
Their
home
is
the
Shadow
Isles
.
Fae:
Playful,
winged,
humanoid
creatures
that
are
smaller
than
the
yordles.
They
inhabit
the
forests
of
the
latter.
Regions

are
many
regions
and
settlements
on
Valoran.

City-States
The
League
of
Legends
recognizes
settlements
with
substantial
influence
on
Valoran
as
city-states.
These
nations
are
afforded
a
great
deal
of
rights
and
protections
within
the
League,
such
as
being
allotted
one
League
Assembly
chair.
The
chosen
emissaries
are
entitled
to
reside
at
the
Institute
of
War
and
cast
votes
in
League
Assemblies
on
their
city-state's
behalf.
They
may
also
appeal
to
the
League
for
general
arbitration
of
political
affairs.
Any
settlement
can
apply
for
membership
in
the
League
and
ascend
to
city-state
status.
However,
they
must
fill
certain
League
requirements:
1.
The
settlement's
population
must
be
of
sufficient
size.
2.
The
settlement
must
have
a
defined
governmental
structure.
3.
The
settlement
must
have
a
means
to
police
itself.
There
are
currently
eight
city-states
recognized
by
the
League:
Bandle
City
Bilgewater
Demacia
Freljord
Ionia
Noxus
Piltover
Zaun

Great
