Trivia
Jayce
was
designed
by
FeralPony
and
Hephastopheles
.
When
Jayce
was
under
production,
his
name
was
"Apollo."
Jayce
is
the
100th
champion
for
League
of
Legends
.
After
the
community
indicated
that
Jayce's
lore
made
Viktor
seem
"like
a
Saturday
morning
cartoon
villain",
his
lore
was
rewritten
to
better
reflect
how
Riot
viewed
their
rivalry.
[1]
This
makes
Jayce
the
second
champion,
after
Shyvana
,
to
have
their
lore
changed
due
to
community
feedback.
Jayce
is
the
second
champion
to
have
his
ultimate
available
at
level
1,
the
first
being
Karma
and
the
third
being
Elise
,
Jayce
is
the
third
champion
to
have
access
to
all
his
abilities
at
level
1,
the
others
being
Udyr
,
Elise
and
Karma
.
Jayce
is
the
first
champion
having
access
to
8
abilities
(ultimate
in
each
stance
should
be
counted
separately).
Jayce
is
one
of
five
champions
to
have
more
than
4
skills,
the
other
being
Nidalee
,
Karma
,
Elise
and
Lee
Sin
.
Jayce
was
the
third
champion
to
have
more
than
4
skills.
Jayce
is
one
of
the
four
champions
who
is
labelled
as
both
melee
and
ranged,
the
others
being
Kayle
,
Elise
and
Nidalee
.
Jayce's
dance
is
a
reference
to
U
Can't
Touch
This
,
which
is
a
song
by
M.C.
Hammer.
A
side-by-side
comparison
can
be
seen
here
.
Jayce's
shares
his
dance
with
Malzahar's
.
Also,
Mercury
Cannon
-
Hammer
can
be
simplified
to
M.C.
Hammer.
Jayce
may
also
be
linked
to
'the
Apprentice'
from
the
game
Orcs
Must
Die!
.
He
has
melee
and
ranged
attacks,
and
look
similar,
as
well
both
can
fire
of
a
blue
ball
of
power.
In
addition,
both
have
the
title
of
defender.
Jayce's
moniker
the
"Defender
of
Tomorrow"
is
a
reference
to
Superman:
The
Man
of
Tomorrow
,
and
bears
a
slight
resemblence
to
Superman.
Jayce
appears
to
have
a
dominant
left
eye
and
a
dominant
right
hand,
as
he
holds
his
cannon
at
the
base
with
his
left
hand,
as
a
left
eyed
person
would
with
a
rifle
regardless
of
left
or
right
hand
dominance,
while
he
holds
his
hammer
with
his
right
hand
near
the
top
of
the
hammer
as
a
right
hander
would.
Quotes
Jayce's
"Shocking"
is
likely
a
reference
to
Goldfinger
.
Jayce
shares
a
quote
with
Viktor
:
"Pave
the
way."
His
quote
"Hammer
time"
is
a
reference
to
the
MC
Hammer
song
U
Can't
Touch
This
.
His
quote
"Energize"
might
be
a
reference
to
Star
Trek's
order
to
teletransport.
Skins
Jayce's
Classic
skin
is
a
possible
reference
to
hammerites
or
mechanists,
both
from
the
Thief
series.
Full
Metal
Jayce's
voice
sounds
similar
to
Viktor
.
This
possibly
reflects
the
important
role
that
Viktor
plays
in
Jayce's
lore.
Full
Metal
Jayce's
suit
is
similar
to
the
suit
of
Samus
Aran
from
the
Metroid
franchise.
It
may
also
be
a
reference
to
Iron
Man,
as
the
voice
filter
is
similar
to
that
used
by
the
Iron
Man
suit
in
the
movies.
Jayce
also
shares
a
similar
backstory
as
an
inventor
who
turns
to
being
a
hero.
It
may
also
be
a
reference
to
the
game
trilogy
"Mass
Effect".
It
may
also
be
a
reference
to
the
movie
"Full
Metal
Jacket".
Debonair
Jayce
is
a
tribute
to
Valentine's
Day
of
2013.
Debonair
Jayce
suit
with
the
white
coat
and
red
rose
also
may
be
a
possible
reference
to
Goldfinger.
Debonair
Jayce
might
be
a
reference
to
Sean
Connery's
James
Bond.
Both
skins
of
Jayce
can
be
considered
references
to
Iron
Man
-
Tony
Stark.
Full
Metal
Jayce
resembles
Iron
Man
while
Debonair
Jayce
resembles
Tony
Stark.
Relations
Viktor
defeated
Jayce
and
stole
a
powerful
arcane
crystal
to
power
his
creations.
Jayce
later
created
the
Mercury
Hammer
and
counter
assaulted
Viktor's
laboratory,
destroying
Viktor's
prototype
weapons.
