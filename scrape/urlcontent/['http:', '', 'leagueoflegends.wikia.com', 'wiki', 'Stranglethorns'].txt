Captain
(although
they

Contrary
to
popular
belief,
plants
will
not
prioritize
enemy
champions
by
default.
While
Zyra
has
an
active
plant,
her
basic
attacks
against
champions
will
"mark"
them
as
a
target
(placing
a
small
icon
above
their
head).
Plants
will
prioritize:
Marked
enemy
champions.
Zyra's
attack
target.
Unknown
default
priority,
likely
the
nearest
enemy.
Note
that
plants
will
often
prioritize
enemy
champions
on
their
first
attack,
which
will
occur
almost
instantly
upon
being
spawned.
Their
attack
priority
will
kick
in
on
their
second
attack.
Cannot
attack
structures.
Plants
take
modified
damage
from
all
sources:
Auto-attacks
from
minions
and
monsters
deal
1
damage.
Auto-attacks
from
champions
deal
2
damage.
Area
of
effect
abilities
deal
3
damage.
Single
target
abilities
deal
4
damage.
Dragon's
attacks
deal
4
damage.
Turrets
deal
6
damage.
Smite
and
Consume
deals
6
damage.
Baron
Nashor
will
ignore
plants,
as
it
ignores
all
non-champion
targets.
Attacks
count
as
spells
in
the
sense
that
they
proc
Banshee's
Veil
and
other
spell
shields,
such
as
Sivir's
Spell
Shield
and
Nocturne's
Shroud
of
Darkness
as
well
as
spell
on-hit
effects
such
as
Rylai's

and
Liandry's
Torment
,
but
does
not
count
as
a

for

Will
stop
