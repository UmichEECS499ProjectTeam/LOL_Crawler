Queue
dodging
is
the
act
of
leaving
the
champion
select
screen
by
interrupting
the
connection
with
the
server.
The
act
is
generally
not
appreciated,
and
the
player
is
penalized
by
the
system,
due
to
the
potential
for
abuse.
There
are
various
reasons
why
people
queue
dodge;
generally,
because
they
are
not
content
with
the
champion
selection
or
the
perceived
ability
of
their
team-mates.
Sometimes
queue
dodging
is
not
intentional,
but
instead
the
result
of
a
connection
loss,
computer
crash,
or
other
technical
mishap.

Methods
The
most
common
method
to
queue
dodge
is
to
close
the
client
before
the
game
starts.
This
is
done
using
the
'X'-button
in
the
top
right
corner.
Another
way
is
to
simply
wait
for
the
timer
to
run
all
the
way
to
zero.
The
advantage
of
this
is
not
having
to
close
and
open
the
client
again.
However,
after
picking
a
champion
this
is
no
longer
an
option
as
it
will
just
lock
in
the
champion
you
have
selected.
Penalties
Penalties
for
queue
dodging
vary
according
to
the
game
type,
although
certain
aspects
are
shared.
See
the
Leaver
Buster
page
for
additional
details.
Time
penalties
All
queues
dodges
give
time
penalties
that
prevent
you
from
queueing
again
immediatly
after.
Those
are
increased
for
subsequent
queue
dodges
within
a
16
hour
window.
This
time
penalty
is
shared
between
the
various
queues,
except
for
ranked
team
queue.

Reasons
Although
it
is
commonly
assumed
to
be
the
primary
reason
people
queue
dodge,
the
selected
champions
of
their
teammates
and/or
enemies
isn't
actually
it.
It
is,
however,
one
of
the
main
reasons.
They
may
not
feel
comfortable
playing
against
a
certain
champion,
team
composition,
or
believe
the
champions
their
teammates
selected
may
lead
to
a
loss.
The
main
reason
(by
far)
for
queue
dodges
is
actually
the
presence
of
trolling,
unskilled,
or
confrontational
teammates,
as
determined
through
chat,
champion
choices,
etc.,
which
causes
the
player
to
decide
to
dodge
as
to
avoid
a
possibly
unnecessary
loss.
There
is
much
controversy
over
this
subject,
as
people
imagine
they
shouldn't
be
punished
(with
time
or
league
series
penalties)
due
to
their
desire
to
avoid
what
they
assume
is
an
almost
certain
loss
because
of
the
misconduct
of
other
players.
Another
reason
is
that
during
champion
selection,
their
teammates
speak
another
language
Some
people
may
also
desire
to
play
an
already
selected
champion.
This
is
often
the
case
when
a
new
champion
or
skin
is
released,
or
during
their
free
week,
when
many
people
want
to
try
the
new
champion/skin.
Another
person
picks
this
champion
first,
causing
the
people
who
want
to
play
this
champion
to
leave.
This
can
happen
many
times
in
a
row,
possibly
causing
long
queue
waiting
times.
Technical
problems,
including
client/computer
crash,
internet
connection
failure,
and
game
server
problems
may
also
result
in
a
queue
dodge.
In
rare
occasions
the
client
might
glitch,
resulting
in
the
player
not
being
able
to
pick
a
champion
and
automatically
being
removed
from
the
champion
selection.
Players
may
also
queue
dodge
in
order
to
rejoin
the
queue
with
friends
who
weren't
with
them
in
the
original
queue.
Some
people
may
queue
dodge
because
of
unexpected
interruptions,
such
as
social
obligations
or
time
constraints.
How
to
avoid
Individual
prevention
Check
the
stability
of
your
system
in
order
to
prevent
errors,
crashes
and
other
problems.
You
might
want
to
close
other
applications
to
reduce
the
risk
of
this
happening.
If
the
game
is
constantly
crashing
during
champion
selection,
the
League
of
Legends
repair
tool
can
fix
most
crashes
and
issues
with
the
game.
If
you
still
have
crashes
or
other
issues
contact
Riot's
technical
support
.
Keeping
others
from
queue
dodging
Talking
during
champion
selection
is
important
in
reducing
the
chance
there
will
be
someone
who
dodges
queue.
Creating
a
positive
environment
in
which
summoners
feel
comfortable
to
talk
about
their
builds
is
ideal.
Asking
the
other
players
what
champion
they
would
like
and
compromising
is
a
great
way
to
make
sure
queue
dodgers
are
minimum.
Remember
that
Co-op
vs.
AI
games
don't
count
towards
your
normal
game
or
ranked
game
score,
and
it
is
a
mode
for
testing
out
builds/ideas,
having
fun
and
allowing
new
players
to
learn
the
game
without
playing
against
smurfs
or
other
summoners.
Glitches
Sometimes,
the
sudden
interruption
of
the
game
can
cause
glitches
in
the
server
or
your
client.
Some
of
these
glitches
are
as
follows:
Splash
art
of
your
picked
champion
will
remain
on
the
right
hand
side
of
your
screen
until
you
reenter
champion
selection.
A
friend
that
you
entered
queue
with
is
removed
from
the
queue,
while
you
advance
to
champion
selection.
