Trivia
Sejuani
was
the
first
champion
released
in
2012.
Sejuani
was
first
announced
by
Ezreal
in
one
of
his
posts.
Sejuani
was
the
fourth
champion
mounted
(the
others
are
Nunu,
Corki,
and
Rumble).
She
was
also
the
second
champion
mounted
on
an
animal
(The
other
one
being
Nunu).
Sejuani's
title
was
formerly
"The
Winter's
Claw,"
but
has
since
been
changed
to
"The
Winter's
Wrath."
Sejuani
is
likely
the
anticipated
female
boar-themed
champion,
though
many
thought
that
the
boar
would
be
the
champion
herself
rather
than
being
the
mount
of
the
champion.
Sejuani's
boar
is
named
Bristle,
a
reference
to
DotA's
Bristleback/Rigwarl;
a
boar-like
hero.
Riot
employees
jokingly
refer
to
Bristle
as
Kevin
Tuggles.
In
Sejuani's
Art
spotlight,
the
artist
names
the
layer
that
has
the
boar
on
it
"Piggles".
Screen
capture
of
it.
Sejuani
is
one
of
four
champions
to
feature
a
Traditional
skin
that
represents
them
as
they
were
prior
to
a
rework,
along
with
Traditional
Karma
,
Traditional
Trundle
and
Traditional
Lee
Sin
.
Sejuani
received
a
visual
upgrade
and
a
new
Classic
skin
.
Her
previous
classic
skin
was
released
in
the
store
for
two
weeks
before
after
her
relaunch,
before
being
retired.
Players
who
owned
Sejuani
before
her
relaunch
received
Traditional
Sejuani
for
free.
Prior
to
it's
appearance
in
the
PBE
,
teaser/concept
was
released
in
the
form
of
a
sketch
made
by
Quinn
during
her
Journey
Into
the
Freljord
.
On
her
new
classic
skin,
her
shield
is
replaced
by
a
Seeker's
Armguard
.
The
aim
of
her
new
classic
skin
is
to
tie
in
her
visuals
with
her
lore,
which
her
chainmail
bikini
did
not.
She
had
a
skin
in
development
called
Queen
Sejuani
but
was
later
remade
into
her
upcoming
Classic
Skin
with
her
rework
.
There's
an
event
between
Ashe
,
Sejuani
,
and
Lissandra
that
is
similar
to
"
The
Hunt
is
On!
",
called,
"
Battle
for
Freljord
".
This
makes
it
a
2nd
event
to
happen
in-game
but
not
directly
to
the
lore.
Nunu
and
Willump
will
drop
one
soul
each
,
for
a
total
of
two
souls!
[1]
It
is
a
Hidden
Passive.
While
similar,
Sejuani
and
Bristle
only
drop
one
soul
between
them.
This
had
led
to
a
joke
among
the
community
that
Sejuani
has
ginger
hair
in
reference
to
the
internet
meme
that
gingers
have
no
soul.
[2]
However,
Katarina
,
Leona
and
Miss
Fortune
are
redheaded
and
do
drop
a
soul
upon
death.
Sejuani
and
Bristle's
case
may
also
stem
from
the
religious
belief
that
animals
have
no
souls.
[3]
Quotes
Sejuani's
previous
selection
quote;
"Winter
is
coming"
is
a
reference
to
the
motto
of
House
Stark
from
the
A
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
book
series
and
the
popular
HBO
program
adaptation.
It
has
also
become
a
popular
meme.
Tradtional
Sejuani
shares
a
quote
with
Blackfrost
Anivia
;
"To
the
bitter
end."
Sejuani's
quote;
"I
will
not
hide
behind
another
shield"
,
might
be
a
reference
to
her
old
model
where
she
holds
a
shield.
Sejuani
shares
a
quote
with
Alistar:
"Stampede!"
Skins
Sejuani's
horn
on
her
helmet
is
on
the
right
on
her
Classic
Skin
while
it
is
on
the
left
on
her
Traditional
Skin,
Sabretusk
Sejuani
Skin,
and
Darkrider
Sejuani
Skin
.
In
the
Chinese
artwork
for
Darkrider
Sejuani,
she
is
wielding
her
weapon
and
shield
in
the
opposite
hands.
Bear
Cavalry
Sejuani
was
made
for
the
celebration
of
the
launch
of
the
Russian
server
.
​All
summoners
who
play
on
the
Russian
server
will
receive
this
skin
for
free.
The
term
"Bear
Cavalry"
may
be
a
reference
to
an
internet
meme
revolving
around
Russian
bear-riders.
It
is
rumored
that
Rengar
stole
the
bear's
left
eye,
since
he
lost
his
to
Kha'zix.
This
would
also
explain
why
his
left
eye
glows
yellow,
similar
to
the
bears.
Relations
According
to
the
Journal
of
Justice
,
Sejuani
is
in
direct
conflict
with
Ashe
,
opposing
Ashe's
claim
as
the
Queen
of
Freljord
.
Sejuani
is
distantly
related
to
Ashe
as
they
both
descended
from
two
of
the
three
legendary
princesses,
who
were
sisters.
Her
ancestor
being
Serylda
as
stated
by
Greyor
while
Ashe's
is
Avarosa
as
stated
by
Lyte
.
Lissandra
is
also
one
of
the
three
legendary
princesses,
effectively
making
her
their
ancient
ancestor.
Sejuani's
gauntlet
is
the
Seeker's
Armguard
.
An
ancient,
iceborn
artifact
that
belonged
to
the
iceborn's
previous
leader,
Lissandra
.
It
is
currently
unknown
how
she
got
hold
of
this
though.
Sejuani
once
fought
with
Olaf
when
he
came
to
die
in
battle
at
the
hands
of
the
Winter's
Claw.
They
fought
till
both
of
them
fell
to
their
knees.
After
being
brought
down
by
him,
she
recruited
him
as
part
of
the
Winter's
Claw,
promising
him
the
glorious
death
he
desired.
Volibear
allied
himself
with
Sejuani
to
defeat
the
Frozen
Watchers
when
they
returned.
Udyr
allied
with
Sejuani
for
his
mission
to
defeat
The
Ice
Witch
.
