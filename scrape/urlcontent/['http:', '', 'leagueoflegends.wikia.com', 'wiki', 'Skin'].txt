Champion
skin
(or
just
skin
)
refers
to
the
color
scheme
or
appearance
of
a
champion.
In
League
of
Legends
,
most
skins
can
be
bought
from
the
Riot
Store
with
Riot
Points
,
while
others
are
or
were
available
only
from
special
events
or
promotions.
Some
of
the
skins
in
League
of
Legends
also
give
champions
different
particle
effects,
quotes,
and
sound
effects.
Every
skin
has
its
own
splash
art
that
is
displayed
in
champion
select
by
clicking
on
the
thumbnail
after
selection.
To
see
all
current
and
old
splash
arts,
visit
this
gallery
.
Additionally,
you
can
see
the
splash
arts,
along
with
the
Chinese
ones
and
a
link
to
a
3D
model
of
each
skin
by
going
to
the
Skins
&
Trivia
sub
page
of
each
champion.
Other
ways
to
access
these
pages
are
to
just
search
for
the
champion
name
on
our
search
bar
and
add
"Skins"
after
the
name;
or
you
could
click
any
of
the
links
below
which
contain
the
names
of
skins.
Skins
in
the
Store
Skins
that
are/were
purchasable
in
the
store
usually
come
in
7
different
price
tags:
390,
520,
750,
975,
1350,
1820
or
3250.
The
skins
tagged
with
the
1820
price,
also
called
Legendary
Skins,
are
skins
that
usually
affect
the
champion
in
more
meaningful
ways
than
just
changes
in
appearance.
As
an
example,
Lion
Dance
Kog'Maw
will
make
him
shoot
out
fireworks
for
his
skills,
instead
of
the
normal
projectiles.
Even
more
special
are
Pulsefire
Ezreal
and
Spirit
Guard
Udyr
,which
change
looks
depending
on
their
level
,
and
come
with
special
summoner
icons
and
profile
banner.
Therefore,
these
skins
have
the
highest
price
yet,
and
cost
3250
RP.
The
"special
effect
rule"
however
isn't
always
true,
especially
for
older
legendary
skins,
where
only
the
model
was
changed;
those
skins
still
had
far
more
work
put
into
them
than
the
others
at
that
time.
Every
few
days,
some
skins
are
put
on
special
discount
for
50%
or
75%
of
the
original
price.
The
current
discounts
are
available
on
the
Main
Page
.

are
a
tribute
to
a
champion
that
underwent
a
significant
visual
upgrade
to
remember
their
old
aesthetic
look.
They
were
released
with
the
Champion's
relaunch
and
were
free
for
owners
that
had
owned
the
champion
before
hand.
If
the
champion
was
not
previously
owned
it
was
put
on

for
two
weeks
before

Limited
Edition
Skins
The
limited
edition
Skins
were
all
skins
available
from
the
League
of
Legends
store
during
seasonal
or
special
events
and
purchasable
for
a
certain
duration
and
then
were
removed
once
the
event
was
over.
Originally,
limited
edition
skins
were
not
to
be
released
from
the
vault
for
further
purchasing,
unfortunately,
to
retain
their
value
to
the
players
that
own
them.
They

be
re-released
for

short
time

art
for
any
limited
edition
skins
will
be
overlayed
with
a
"vintage"
look.

skins

those
released
for
major
events
in
the
years
2009
to
2011:

created
and

line
of
