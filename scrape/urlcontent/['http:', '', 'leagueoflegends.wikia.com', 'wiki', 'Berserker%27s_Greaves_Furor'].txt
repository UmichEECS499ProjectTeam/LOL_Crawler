Notes
This
is
a
great
item
for
AD
carries,
or
auto-attacking
bruisers
with
reliable
gap
closers.
This
passive
is
similar
to
the
Rage
passive
provided
by
Phage
,
Trinity
Force
and
Entropy
,
and
will
multiply
the
flat
movement
speed
bonus.
Attacking
structures
does
not
activate
the
passive.
Hitting
a
single
enemy
with
an
AoE
spell
does
not
proc
the
passive.
DoT
single
target
damage
does
not
seem
to
proc
the
passive
(needs
further
testing).
Ranged
champions
making
use
of
Runaan's
Hurricane
will
still
proc
the
bonus
move
speed
from
this
enchantment.
Pet's
autoattacks
do
not
proc
the
passive.
