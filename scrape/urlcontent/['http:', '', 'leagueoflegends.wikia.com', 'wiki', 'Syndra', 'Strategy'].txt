Champion
Background

&
Trivia
Skill
Usage
It
is
recommended
to
get
one
of
your
spells
to
rank
5
as
quickly
as
possible
to
benefit
from
its
Transcendent
bonus.
Maxing
Dark
Sphere
first
is
highly
recommended.
This
will
increase
the
damage
vs
champions,
while
the
other
Transcendent
bonuses
offer
improved
utility
but
no
extra
damage.
It
is
also
recommended
that
smartcasting
is
used
on
all
of
Syndra's
abilities
except
her
ultimate.
This
allows
for
seamless
transition
between
her
abilities
and
faster
combos,
which
is
critical
in
team
fights.
However,
while
Dark
Sphere
and
Scatter
the
Weak
are
musts
for
smartcasting,
you
may
not
want
to
smartcast
Force
of
Will
as
you
could
end
up
grabbing
a
minion
instead
of
an
sphere
or
grabbing
the
wrong
sphere.
This
problem
disappears
as
you
get
used
to
Syndra.
To
get
out
4
bonus
spheres
(the
maximum
possible)
you
need
more
than
30%
cooldown
reduction
and
you
can
do
this
by
using
the
following
combo:
Q,
Q,
W
(targeting
the
first
sphere),
Q,
Q,
followed
immediately
by
Unleashed
Power
.
However,
the
delay
on
her
ultimate
and
the
increased
micro
management
requires
a
higher
level
of
skill
on
an
already
difficult
champion.
For
most
players,
it
may
be
more
efficient
to
try
using
Q
and
E,
Q
again
and
W
on
the
first
dark
sphere,
and
then
use
Unleashed
Power
-
this
sacrifices
one
or
two
dark
spheres
on
her
ultimate
for
a
quicker,
more
reliable
combo.
Four
sphere
combo
is
mostly
used
to
kill
a
very
tanky
champion,
like
a
fighter.
Two
sphere
(assuming
you
actually
hit
the
damage
of
the
sphere
summoning
itself)
is
usually
enough
to
smash
a
squishy
target
(Syndra
decimates
squishies)
like
a
Marksmen
or
Mage.
One
or
no
sphere
is
only
used
if
you
have
everything
else
on
cooldown
and
need
to
kill
someone
immediately,
the
damage
is
actually
quite
respectable
with
only
one
bonus
sphere.
If
you
notice
your
opponent
is
easily
avoiding
all
your
Dark
Sphere
try
to
become
more
conservative
about
it,
the
low
cooldown
makes
it
tempting
to
use
continuously,
but
pushes
the
lane
if
you
hit
minions
(and
invites
junglers)
and
drains
your
mana
quickly.
Dark
Sphere
has
no
channel
upon
cast,
which
means
you
can
cast
it
without
interrupting
your
movement.
Take
this
into
consideration
when
playing
Syndra,
since
it
allows
you
to
kite
and
chase
enemy
champions
easily.
During
laning,
keep
Syndra
always
on
the
move,
only
stopping
to
last
hit
or
kill
someone.
This
way
Syndra
will
be
more
safe
from
skillshots
and
delayed
abilities
and
she
wll
be
free
to
poke
with
Dark
Sphere
while
still
moving.
To
maximize
your
chances
of
hitting
the
enemy
champion
with
Dark
Spheres
,
use
it
right
when
they
last-hit.
After
you
hit
an
enemy
champion
with
Force
of
Will
,
follow
up
with
Dark
Sphere
;
they'll
be
slowed
and
have
a
hard
time
avoiding
it.
If
you
are
confident
enough
in
your
own
aiming,
casting
Dark
Sphere
right
after
Force
of
Will
will
cause
them
to
hit
at
the
same
time;
this
can
save
a
few
seconds
if
you
are
considering
a
combo
for
Unleashed
Power
.
When
being
chased
in
the
jungle,
use
Force
of
Will
on
a
nearby
neutral
monster
to
slow
the
enemy
champion.
Thin
choke
points
like
most
of
the
jungle
will
make
it
easier
to
use
Scatter
the
Weak
when
an
opponent
gets
too
close.
Force
of
Will
can
be
used
to
throw
enemy
player
pets
such
as
Annie's
Tibbers
to
get
them
away
from
allies
or
yourself.
Be
careful
about
grabbing
Annie's
Tibbers
as
his
damaging
aura
is
still
active
while
held
by
Force
of
Will
.
Even
though
it
is
possible
to
teleport
while
carrying
a
minion
or
buff
with
Force
of
Will
the
link
will
break
and
it
will
be
released
from
where
you
teleported
from.
Placing
a
Dark
Sphere
directly
in
front
of
yourself
and
then
follow
it
up
with
a
quick
and
well
aimed
Scatter
the
Weak
gives
you
a
long
range
stun.
Try
using
Scatter
the
Weak
right
after
using
Unleashed
Power
for
an
increased
chance
on
stunning
enemies
for
a
quick
follow
up
of
Force
of
Will
and
Dark
Sphere
.
Placing
a
Sight
Ward
next
to
the
enemy
blue
buff
camp
makes
it
easy
for
Syndra
to
steal
it
using
Force
of
Will
.
When
fleeing,
creating
a
Dark
Sphere
,
followed
by
Scatter
the
Weak
or
Force
of
Will
,
can
give
a
good
distance
between
you
and
enemies.
Try
to
stay
back
in
teamfights
since
Syndra
is
pretty
fragile.
Her
main
damage
abilities,
Dark
Sphere
and
Force
of
Will
have
good
range
so
she
can
stay
back.
You
should
only
get
close
to
use
Unleashed
Power
(before
rank
3
the
range
is
quite
short)
after
you
have
summoned
about
two
spheres.
If
someone
gets
too
close
punish
them
with
a
Dark
Sphere
into
a
stun
with
Scatter
the
Weak
.
If
the
enemy
is
relentless
drop
another
sphere,
a
Force
of
Will
and
a
finishing
ultimate.
Build
Usage
Syndra's
damage
output
is
reliant
on
a
high
CDR
build
-
it
will
provide
stronger
harass
with
Q
and
W
combos,
and
being
able
to
maintain
more
dark
spheres
on
the
battlefield
will
potentially
increase
the
damage
on
Unleashed
Power
.
She
is
extremely
mana
hungry.
Athene's
Unholy
Grail
provides
every
stat
she
needs;
AP,
CDR,
and
mana
regen.
The
passive
on
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
synergizes
with
all
of
her
spells
to
varying
degrees;
however
the
bonus
mana
on
Rod
of
Ages
will
help
with
Syndra's
high
mana
costs
and
may
be
a
preferable
option
depending
on
your
runes
and
masteries.
Building
a
Deathfire
Grasp
will
help
provide
Syndra
with
more
AP
and
CDR,
as
well
as
its
active
effect
will
help
with
her
damage
out
put
and
improve
her
burst.
Due
to
Syndra
's
low
cooldowns
on
Dark
Sphere
,
an
early
Tear
of
the
Goddess
,
and
then
an
Archangel's
Staff
,
can
be
charged
quickly
and
therefore
a
viable
item
to
have.
It
has
been
debated
that
Manamune
is
a
better
purchase
on
Syndra
due
to
the
Muramana
active,
which
triggers
per
sphere
during
Unleashed
Power
.
With
only
Muramana
for
mana,
the
bonus
damage
per
sphere
at
full
mana
is
between
93-129
(level
6-18).
This
is
the
single
most
damage
attainable
from
only
a
single
item,
and
is
the
equivalent
of
having
465-645
bonus
ability
power.
This
is
279-387
bonus
damage
with
only
the
minimum
3
spheres.

Countering
Get
boots
early
when
playing
against
Syndra
,
they'll
help
you
avoid
many
of
her
spells.
Constantly
moving
or
strafing
unpredictably
will
make
it
much
harder
for
Syndra
to
harrass
you
with
her
Dark
Sphere
s
Attack
Syndra
after
she's
used
Scatter
the
Weak
,
it
has
a
long
cooldown,
so
she
will
be
vulnerable.
With
no
reliable
escape
tool
she
is
also
easily
ganked
and
weak
against
champions
with
gap
closers
and
crowd
controls.
When
ganking
her
split
up
so
she
can't
use
Force
of
Will
and
Scatter
the
Weak
to
disable
both
you
and
your
ally.
If
she
manages
to
stun
she
will
also
easily
get
to
slow
you,
and
will
likely
escape
if
both
you
and
your
ally
are
affected
by
this.
If
Syndra
keeps
creating
Dark
Sphere
s
in
a
situation
were
she
would
be
better
off
doing
something
else
(like
re-positioning
or
knocking
back
enemies),
then
she
is
likely
preparing
to
use
her
ultimate.
But
beware
when
she
has
3-4
Dark
Sphere
on
the
terrain
during
teamfights,
because
she
can
then
deal
massive
damage
with
Unleashed
Power
(up
to
1260+140%
AP),
followed
by
Scatter
the
Weak
to
instantly
kill
a
team
member
and
stun
the
whole
team
if
you're
not
spread
out
enough.
Syndra
is
a
bursty
mage,
try
to
focus
her
down
first
if
you
are
having
problems
with
her
damage.
â€‹In
late
game
she
can
be
very
powerful
with
her
spammable
nuke.
Try
to
deny
her
farming
early
game
to
cut
down
on
her
damage
potential
later
on.
Be
wary
when
dueling
in
a
1v1
with
Syndra
.
If
her
ultimate
Unleashed
Power
is
available
she
can
instantly
burst
you
down
before
you
are
able
to
kill
her.
The
Scatter
the
Weak
and
Dark
Sphere
stun
combo
can
be
very
hard
to
land
if
enemy
is
too
close
to
her,
meaning
bursty
melee
assassin
can
kill
her
with
ease.
If
using
this
method,
beware
her
ultimate
Unleashed
Power
since
it
has
pretty
short
range,
meaning
she
might
use
it
on
you,
being
the
closest
person.
Try
this
plan
when
her
ultimate
goes
on
cooldown.
(Warning:
at
rank
3
her
ultimate's
range
is
increased
by
75)
