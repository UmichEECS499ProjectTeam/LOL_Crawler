The
Kinkou
Order
is
an
ancient
clan
originating
in
the
Ionian
Isles
dedicated
to
the
preservation
of
balance.
Order,
chaos,
light,
darkness
--
all
things
must
exist
in
perfect
harmony,
for
such
is
the
way
of
the
universe.
The
Order
employs
a
triumvirate
of
shadow
warriors
to
uphold
its
causes
in
the
world.
The
three
warriors
are
each
entrusted
with
one
of
three
sacred
duties:
Watching
the
Stars,
Coursing
the
Sun
and
Pruning
the
Tree.
Being
open
minded
in
regards
to
their
choice
of
students,
the
Order
is
willing
to
train
individuals
from
other
nations,
so
long
as
those
individuals
prove
to
be
best
suited
in
carrying
out
the
duties
entrusted
to
them.
In
order
to
enforce
the
balance
within
Valoran
,
the
warriors'
hallowed
pursuit
has
unsurprisingly
led
them
to
the
Fields
of
Justice
.
There
is
a
rivalry
between
Shen,
the
Eye
of
Twilight
,
and
Zed,
the
Master
of
Shadows
.
Zed
trained
under
Shen's
father,
only
to
later
kill
his
master
and
destroy
the
old
ninja
order.
Now
both
Shen
and
Zed
belong
to
their
respective
ninja
clans:
Shen
rebuilding
the
Kinkou
Order,
and
Zed
being
the
master
of
his
own
clan,
the
Order
of
the
Shadow.
The
Triumvirate
Akali,
the
Fist
of
Shadows
,
entrusted
with
the
sacred
duty
of
Pruning
the
Tree
-
eliminating
those
who
threaten
the
equilibrium
of
Valoran.
Kennen,
the
Heart
of
the
Tempest
,
entrusted
with
the
sacred
duty
of
Coursing
the
Sun
-
tirelessly
conveying
the
justice
of
the
Kinkou.
Shen,
the
Eye
of
Twilight
,
entrusted
with
the
sacred
duty
of
Watching
the
Stars
-
exercising
judgment
untainted
by
prejudice.
