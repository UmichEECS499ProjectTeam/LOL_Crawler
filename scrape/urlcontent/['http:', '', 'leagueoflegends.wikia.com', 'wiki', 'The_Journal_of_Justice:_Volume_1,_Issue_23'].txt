Prisoner
Found
Dead
in
Kalamanda
Boram
Darkwill
leaves
Noxus
with
military
escort
Quinton
Groat
reporting
from
Kalamanda
A
carriage
believed
to
be
carrying
General
Boram
Darkwill
departs
from
Noxus.
The
Demacian
soldier
who
publically
confessed
to
conspiracy
and
sabotage
in
Kalamanda
was
found
dead
in
his
cell
yesterday,
a
victim
of
Nyzer
poisoning.
Investigations
are
underway,
but
as
of
yet
Kalamanda
officials
are
at
a
loss
as
to
how
such
a
poison
managed
to
elude
the
notice
of
its
guards.
With
news
that
the
prisoner’s
interrogation
was
scheduled
for
later
this
weekend,
suspicious
eyes
are
being
cast
at
the
visiting
delegations
of
Noxus
and
Demacia.
Though
representatives
from
both
city-states
denied
any
wrongdoing,
military
activity
had
visibly
increased
in
both
camps
over
the
last
two
weeks.
Perhaps
most
disturbing
of
all,
a
carriage
believed
to
contain
General
Boram
Darkwill
himself
was
seen
departing
Noxus
soon
after
the
prisoner’s
fate
was
discovered.
By
all
accounts,
the
ageless,
reclusive
leader
of
Noxus
hasn’t
set
foot
outside
of
the
castle
since
the
formation
of
the
League
of
Legends
over
two
decades
ago.
The
prisoner’s
testimony
was
expected
to
put
to
rest
the
question
of
which
city-state
Kalamanda
would
grant
exclusive
mining
rights
to.
In
the
absence
of
convincing
evidence
as
to
who
poisoned
the
prisoner,
the
heat
is
back
on
Kalamanda’s
ruling
council
to
decide
–
a
difficult
decision
to
make
with
accusations
flying
and
the
formidable
armies
of
both
candidates
perched
on
their
doorstep.
Noxian
supporters
have
been
quick
to
indicate
that
the
prisoner’s
interrogation
was
delayed
for
weeks
without
public
explanation
by
King
Jarvan
III
of
Demacia.
The
King
responded
personally
to
the
claims
by
stating
that
he
was
conducting
a
thorough
background
check
on
the
soldier
in
question,
due
to
concerns
that
his
earlier
confession
might
have
been
coerced.
He
didn’t
specify
the
results
of
the
background
check,
but
he
promised
that
it
would
follow
“in
due
course”.
The
use
of
Nyzer
poison
is
unusual,
although
it
creates
more
questions
than
it
answers.
Nyzer
has
a
bitter,
distinct
taste,
which
makes
it
a
poor
choice
to
slip
to
an
unsuspecting
victim.
It
does,
however,
lead
to
a
very
peaceful
death.
For
this
reason,
it’s
most
commonly
used
to
euthanize
animals,
and
is
therefore
accessible
to
a
broad
range
of
people.
This
begs
the
question:
did
the
prisoner
take
it
willingly?
While
Kalamanda
strategizes
its
next
play,
the
city-state
delegations
have
been
cautioned
by
the
League
to
maintain
the
peace.
High
Councilor
Vessaria
Kolminye
issued
this
statement,
“the
last
thing
we
want
is
for
this
incident
to
lead
to
any
serious
lapses
in
judgment.
We’ve
come
too
far
to
see
the
world
plunged
back
into
conflict
over
money
and
resources.”
Withering
Curse
Cleansed
from
League
Champion
Kayle
The
Judicator,
discovered
to
be
the
victim
of
dark
magic,
returns
renewed
Kaldera
Carnadine
reporting
from
the
Institute
of
War
League
Champion
Kayle
was
discovered
early
this
week
to
be
the
victim
of
a
withering
curse
specifically
designed
to
limit
her
power
upon
the
Fields
of
Justice
.
The
Judicator,
after
seeking
the
assistance
of
Institute
officials,
has
returned
to
the
League
with
renewed
strength
and
fully
re-enchanted
armor.
The
culprit
behind
the
withering
curse
remains
unknown.
According
to
Institute
officials,
the
discovery
of
the
curse
follows
a
notable
decline
in
the
Judicator's
performance
on
the
Fields
of
Justice.
Kayle
had
suffered
a
decrease
in
popularity
with
summoners
in
the
past
months
due
to
her
poor
showings
in
League
matches.
"I
often
found
it
difficult
to
draw
forth
the
Judicator's
full
potential
I
once
knew
her
to
be
capable
of,"
said
one
summoner.
"I
imagined
there
to
be
a
reason
for
her
troubles,
but
I
would
have
never
suspected
sabotage
or
magical
interference."
"I
had
not
felt
like
myself
for
quite
some
time.
It
began
shortly
after
the
contagion
warning
at
the
Institute
two
months
ago,"
said
the
Judicator
herself.
"I
only
realized
something
was
amiss
when
I
discovered
cracks
in
my
armor
after
a
match
this
week.
Not
only
is
it
enchanted
against
such
wear,
but
the
magic
of
the
Fields
of
Justice
usually
prevents
lasting
damage
as
well.
I
knew
it
should
not
be
possible,
so
I
sought
the
assistance
of
the
Institute's
summoners
and
artificers
immediately."
Upon
close
inspection
from
Institute
specialists,
the
withering
spell
was
reportedly
discovered
to
be
connected
to
the
synthetic
arcane
disease
which
invaded
the
Institute
two
months
ago.
"It's
extremely
high-level
magic,"
explained
Corfaiel
Dithins,
who
had
led
the
investigation
of
the
contagion.
"The
initial
invigoration
Kayle
felt
from
the
contagion
was
the
withering
curse
taking
effect.
While
she
was
immune
to
the
disease
itself,
she
was
the
only
one
susceptible
to
the
hidden
magic
beneath
it--we
now
suspect
that
the
Judicator
was
the
true
target."
Institute
officials
were
able
to
cleanse
the
curse
after
some
experimentation.
"I
feel
renewed,"
said
Kayle.
"It
was
as
though
my
own
power
had
been
suppressed
deep
within
me.
My
abilities
feel
stronger
than
ever
before.
I
eagerly
await
my
next
visit
to
the
Field
of
Justice."
League
artificers
were
able
to
repair
Kayle's
armor
as
well,
giving
it
the
glowing
luster
of
fresh
enchantment.
The
Institute
of
War
will
continue
to
research
the
withering
curse
for
further
leads.
Morgana
was
quickly
identified
as
a
suspect,
but
she
denied
involvement.
As
no
true
evidence
has
been
discovered,
no
action
has
been
taken
against
her.
"If
there
is
one
being
in
Runeterra
who
would
find
a
way
to
work
dark
magic
right
under
the
nose
of
the
League
itself,
it
would
be
my
sister,"
said
Kayle.
"I,
however,
await
evidence
from
the
Institute.
Justice
will
be
served."
The
Balloon
Burglary
Balloons
disappear
from
Tenderfeets
Bake
Sale
Kaldera
Carnadine
reporting
from
Bandle
City
Members
of
the
Bandle
City
Tenderfeets,
a
premier
yordle
youth
organization,
were
saddened
to
discover
that
their
semi-annual
bake
sale
had
been
robbed
of
its
decorative
balloons
on
Friday
morning.
The
burglary
occurred
just
minutes
before
the
sale
was
scheduled
to
begin
when
the
sale's
young
yordle
hosts
and
a
handful
of
their
supervisors
were
the
only
witnesses
at
the
scene.
"We
were
almost
finished
setting
up,"
said
Colin
Dee,
a
first-year
member
of
the
Tenderfeets.
"It
took
us
all
morning
to
make
everything
look
nice.
We
started
bringing
out
the
cupcakes
and
cookies
when
bunches
of
our
balloons
started
vanishing.
They
were
pulled
into
some
kind
of
black
hole—it
only
took
a
few
seconds,
and
they
were
gone!"
Supervisors
present
at
the
bake
sale
reportedly
began
searching
the
area
on
suspicion
of
a
magical
threat,
but
the
perpetrator
was
not
found
and
no
other
damages
were
done.
League
Champions
Teemo
and
Tristana
,
who
attended
the
bake
sale
in
support
of
the
Tenderfeets,
voiced
some
concern
over
the
burglary.
"There's
something
else
going
on,"
commented
Teemo.
"If
the
burglar
really
wanted
to
ruin
the
bake
sale,
he
would've
stolen
the
cupcakes.
Why
the
balloons?
If
there's
one
thing
I
learned
when
I
was
a
Tenderfoot
myself,
it
was
to
never
underestimate
an
enemy.
Even
an
enemy
who
steals
balloons!"
After
the
area
was
deemed
secure,
the
bake
sale
commenced
as
planned,
though
its
young
hosts
seemed
to
have
lost
their
enthusiasm.
"The
bake
sale
is
usually
so
festive,"
said
Dyna
Halison,
mother
of
two
members
and
a
regular
bake
sale
patron.
"But
this
really
seemed
to
break
their
spirits—it
was
heartbreaking
to
see
the
children
so
shaken
and
upset.
Who
would
try
to
ruin
an
event
that
benefits
children?
I
bought
twice
as
many
cookies
this
year
to
cheer
them
up!"
The
Tenderfeets
finished
out
the
bake
sale
an
hour
earlier
than
planned,
having
sold
all
of
their
goods.
Supervisors
reported
that
the
influx
of
customers,
either
in
sympathy
for
the
children
or
in
curiosity
following
the
burglary,
actually
boosted
sales
far
beyond
expectations.
"We've
been
more
successful
than
we
were
in
the
past
several
bake
sales,"
commented
one
supervisor.
"We
probably
raised
enough
to
afford
new
uniforms
and
a
field
trip
into
the
Sablestone
Mountains.
Perhaps
we
owe
our
thanks
to
this
Balloon
Burglar
after
all!"

Senior
Summoner
Ralston
Farnsley
commenting
from
the
Institute
of
War
With
the
newest
champion
joining
the
League,
some
people
have
asked
if
the
League
is
violating
its
own
policy
on
necromancy.
I
would
like
to
clarify
that
necromancy
is
permitted
for
use
on
the
Fields
of
Justice
by
champions,
it’s
only
forbidden
for
use
within
the
Institute
or
by
Institute
officials.
Champions
have
contracts
with
the
League,
although
they
are
not
directly
employed
or
commanded
by
it.
There
are
some
caveats
to
that
statement,
but
it’s
generally
true
for
these
purposes.
Beyond
all
that,
the
new
champion’s
method
is…somewhat
different
than
what
is
currently
classified
as
necromancy.
"I
have
a
question
for
Professor
Stanwick
Pididly
regarding
Urgot
.
From
what
I've
seen,
Urgot
is
a
death
machine,
and
I'm
curious
as
to
why
you
haven't
made
some
attempt
to
mass
produce.
I
personally
can't
think
of
a
scarier
team
than
5
Urgots,
especially
with
the
way
Noxian
corrosive
charges
work.
Imagine
getting
hit
with
acid
and
having
5
immediate
Acid
Hunters
flying
toward
you.
I
understand
volunteers
for
the
project
may
be
scarce,
but
seeing
as
how
the
project
would
either
take
place
in
Zaun
or
Noxus...
I'm
sure
you
could
find
a
way
to
acquire
a
few
subjects..."
–
Wipey
Professor
Pididly,
despite
how
often
he
appears
in
the
headlines,
is
quite
a
recluse.
I
had
to
requisition
the
escort
of
Zaunite
authorities
in
order
to
properly
pound
the
streets
to
find
him.
It’s
anybody’s
guess
what
he’s
up
to
at
any
given
moment
in
time.
”Ah,
this
question.
Yes,
it’s
true
that
several
Urgot
models
would
make
for
quite
a
devastating
squad,
however
you
should
not
underestimate
the
resilience
of
the
man
inside
the
machine.
It
takes
a
very
special
sort
to
survive
the
procedure,
but
it
takes
an
exceptional
specimen
to
endure
once
it’s
complete.
I
have,
as
you
say,
acquired
other
subjects
for
testing,
and
where
some
of
them
made
it
to
mechanization,
they
all
universally
succumbed
to…unfortunate
after-effects.
I
believe
we’ve
tackled
the
problem
of
the
body
rejecting
the
prosthesis;
it
seems
that
the
primary
obstacle
now
is
the
mind.
I
am
of
the
opinion
that
Urgot's
raw
hatred
is
what
keeps
him
alive,
even
battling
back
from
behind
the
jaws
of
death.”
"Dear
Pentakill:
As
a
new
summoner,
I
have
been
hard
at
work
training,
working
with
several
champions
who
share
my
style.
One
such
champion,
and
the
frontman
for
the
band
Pentakill,
is
the
master
of
metal
himself:
Mordekaiser
.
Although
he
has
joined
forces
with
the
musically
talented
Sona
to
make
a
band
to
bring
the
life-changing
music
of
metal
to
the
League,
it
confuses
me
that
there
are
only
two
members:
guitar
and
keyboards.
After
giving
it
some
thought,
I
would
like
to
ask
the
frontman
himself
if
he
has
any
plans
at
all
for
additions
to
the
band
and
what
new
heights
he
has
in
store
for
them?"
–
Lemarius
Getting
a
backstage
pass
to
a
Pentakill
show
is
perhaps
the
next
most
difficult
thing
to
getting
to
interview
champions
after
League
matches.
Nonetheless,
I
fought
through
legions
of
spiky,
thrashing
Pentakill
enthusiasts
to
get
you
Mordekaiser’s
response.
"Pentakill
is
recruiting.
We
get
lots
of
applications.
One
new
member
is
coming
soon.
You
will
all
suffer
his
brutal
wrath."
"This
question
is
regarding
the
article
on
Summoning
last
issue.
Briskes
said
that
a
summoner
must
pull
a
certain
being
from
all
of
life
on
Runeterra
(or
beyond?).
This
caused
me
to
think,
could
you
summon
something
other
than
a
champion?
I
imagine
such
rules
are
in
place
in
the
League
to
prevent
summoners
from
doing
this,
but
could
a
rogue
summoner
pull
it
off?"
–
Mykiel
For
the
most
part,
the
League
recruits
all
those
with
the
talent
for
summoning.
It
is
a
very
complicated
magic
which
is
exceedingly
difficult
to
master
without
the
diligent
tutelage
of
an
experienced
summoner.
It
is,
of
course,
illegal
to
summon
any
creature
from
this
or
any
other
world
against
its
will
without
the
prior
consent
of
the
League.
At
the
end
of
the
Rune
Wars,
this
was
not
the
case,
which
is
why
we
have
some
of
the
champions
present
in
the
League
today.
Accepting
that
there
is
an
individual
with
such
talent
out
there,
he
would
likely
provoke
the
League’s
attention
by
using
magic
of
that
magnitude.
Valoran
is
constantly
monitored
in
order
to
ensure
our
security
–
our
misuse
of
magic
nearly
destroyed
us
all
and
we’re
committed
to
avoiding
any
future
mistakes
at
all
cost.
