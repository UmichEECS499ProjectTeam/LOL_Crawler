Redirected
from
Poison
Damage
over
time
(
DoT
)
is
a
term
used
to
describe
a
single
spell
or
attack
which
deals
full
damage
not
instantly
but
over
a
period
of
time,
dealing
a
portion
of
its
total
damage
at
regular
intervals.
The
damage
is
often
done
every
second
or
every
half-second,
and
each
instant
in
which
it
is
dealt
is
called
a
"tick."
The
slow
effect
from
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
always
applies
a
15%
slow
from
abilities
which
deal
this
type
of
damage;
the
slow
is
applied
from
the
first
tick
of
the
DoT
until
1.
5
seconds
after
the
last
tick.
For
single-target
DoT
spells,
spell
vamp
will
be
applied
to
the
total
amount
of
damage
dealt
by
all
ticks.

Types
of
DoTs
and
their
sources
The
different
types
of
DoTs
only
differ
in
whether
you
can
interrupt
its
duration
by
moving
out
of
the
area.
Non-decreasable
duration
Once
applied,
there
is
no
way
to
prevent
further
damage
from
the
source
apart
from
activating
Quicksilver
Sash
to
cleanse
the
effect.

Blessing
of

Elder
Tether-like
DoTs
These
are
single-target
abilities
which
deal
damage
over
time
by
creating
a
visible
link
between
the
source
of
the
damage
and
the
target,
they
can
be
interrupted
by
moving
out
of
range
of
or
killing
the
enemy
champion,
if
that
champion
is
the
source.
Another
difference
is
that
further
damage
from
these
abilities
cannot
be
avoided
with
the
use
of
Quicksilver
Sash

DoTs
These
refer
to
any
ability
which
continually
deals
damage
but
requires
enemy
units
to
be
in
its
area
of
effect
.
Some
of
these
leave
a
damaging
debuff
that
keeps
damaging
targets
for
some
time
after
they
leave
the
area.
Some
sources
of
this
type
of
DoT
are
moving
units
while
some
affect
a
static
area
that
damages
enemies
that
stand
or
walk
above
it.
Further
damage
from
these
abilities
cannot
be
avoided
with
the
use
of
