NOTE:
Not
to
be
confused
with
spell
effects
,
which
are
additional
effects
that
occur
when
an
ability
lands.
On-hit
effects
are
effects
that
trigger
on
a
champion
's
autoattacks
and
a
select
few
abilities.
An
autoattack
or
ability
that
applies
on-hit
effects
can
apply
any
number
of
these
effects
at
once.
Critical
Strikes
Critical
strike
is
not
considered
an
on-hit
effect.
A
very
select
few
abilities
can
critically
strike,
namely
Parrrley
and
Judgment
,
but
this
should
not
be
mistaken
for
standard
functionality.
In
almost
all
cases,
the
attack
that
triggers
an
on-hit
effects
may
still
critically
strike
and
apply
life
steal.
Also
in
most
cases,
critically
striking
will
not
affect
the
damage
of
the
on-hit
effect,
unless
explicitly
said
otherwise,
such
as
the
Statik
Shiv
.
Lifesteal
Life
steal
is
an
offensive
stat
that
converts
a
percentage
of
the
physical
damage
dealt
by
a
champion's
basic
attack
or
ability
that
applies
on-hit
effects
to
health
regained.
For
the
main
article,
see
life
steal
.
Life
steal
applies
to
all
physical
damage
dealt
on-hit,
including
any
sourced
from
on-hit
effects
(with
a
few
exceptions).
Sheen
and
Nasus's
Siphoning
Strike
is
a
renowned
example
of
powerful
sustain
as
life
steal
not
only
applies
to
the
basic
damage
on
the
attack,
but
the
bonus
damage
on
Sheen
and
the
stacked
damage
on
Siphoning
Strike.
Life
steal
is
calculated
from
the
actual
damage
done
to
an
enemy
after
armor
and
all
other
forms
of
damage
reduction.
Almost
all
champions
have
0%
base
life
steal.
It
can
be
increased
with
items,
runes,
masteries,
and
some
champion
abilities.
Damage
dealt
to
enemies
beyond
your
target
through
splash
damage
will
not
apply
life
steal.
That
is
unless
the
damaging
effect
specifically
states
that
on-hit
effects
will
apply
to
all
enemies
damaged
(such
as
Ravenous
Hydra
and
Spray
and
Pray
).

While
blinded,
an
attacker
will
not
cause
any
on-hit
damage.
In
most
cases,
non-damaging
effects
will
still
occur.
Also
in
most
cases,
most
one-use
abilities
will
not
be
consumed
until
the
attacker
successfully
lands
an
attack.

Quinn's

Abilities
that
apply
on-hit

The
following
abilities
will
apply
on-hit
effects
instead
of

Any

not
listed
here
will
apply
spell
effects
,
regardless
of
how
similar
it
may
be
to
the
abilities
on
this
list
or
how
similar
to

resembles
a
basic
