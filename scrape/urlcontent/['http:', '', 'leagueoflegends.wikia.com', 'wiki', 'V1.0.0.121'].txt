The
patch
was
due
to
be
released
on
the
week
of
the
4th
of
July,
but
it
was
delayed
several
days
because
of
the
last
minute
bugs.
Riot
ultimately
decided
to
release
first
the
changes
to
the
PVP.net
platform
only
during
the
server
downtime
scheduled
for
Thursday,
July
7th
early
morning.
However,
the
PVP.net
changes
were
delayed
further
and
the
server
downtime
was
cut
short
too.
The
patch
was
finally
released
on
Friday,
July
8th
at
2
PM
(PDT).
But
new
content
(Leona,
first
batch
of
new
skins)
wasn't
available
for
purchase
until
Wednesday,
July
13.
