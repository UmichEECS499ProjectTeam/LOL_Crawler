Trivia
Lord
Van
Damm's
Pillager
provides
the
exact
same
stats
and
passive
as
Infinity
Edge
.
The
only
difference
is
its
build
path.
This
was
done
purposely
to
allow
building
this
item
easier
on
Twisted
Treeline
and
Dominion
.
The
item
was
named
after
a
summoner
from
EU
West
as
a
Refer
A
Friend
reward.
This
summoner
was
known
as
one
of
administrators
of
Russian
fan-site
lol-game.ru.
