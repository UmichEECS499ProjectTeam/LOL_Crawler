Ionia
Demands
a
Rematch
with
Noxus
The
Ionians
have
developed
some
of
the
most
breathtaking
and
deadly
martial
arts
on
all
of
Runeterra
–
just
one
manifestation
of
their
pursuit
of
enlightenment.
The
most
remarkable
blade
style
to
emerge,
however,
was
the
unusual
byproduct
of
foreign
intervention.
Master
Lito
was
a
swordsman
whose
teachings
were
sought
by
ruling
classes
from
nearly
every
city-state.
His
art
was
a
highly-guarded
secret,
but
it
was
said
that
swords
would
breathe
in
his
grasp.
He
withered
unexpectedly
from
a
mysterious
disease
which
baffled
the
brightest
of
Runeterran
physicians.
When
he
died,
he
left
behind
Zelos
and
Irelia,
his
son
and
daughter,
and
a
truly
unique
weapon.
Zelos
became
a
Sergeant
in
the
Ionian
military
and
left
to
seek
assistance
from
Demacia
immediately
prior
to
Noxus
'
invasion
of
Ionia.
Irelia,
charged
with
the
protection
of
their
home
until
Zelos
returned,
was
alone
when
Noxian
forces
struck.
The
Ionians
fought
admirably,
but
soon
Ionian
blood
stained
the
land
beneath
the
prints
of
foreign
boots.
At
the
Great
Stand
of
the
Placidium,
Ionians
prepared
for
surrender,
but
were
inspired
to
maintain
their
resistance
when
the
young
Irelia
hoisted
her
father’s
enormous
blade
and
pledged
to
hold
until
her
brother
returned.
In
the
chaos
of
the
ensuing
fight,
Irelia
was
cursed
with
dark
Noxian
necromancy.
As
her
life
ebbed,
Soraka,
the
Starchild
,
made
a
final
attempt
to
anchor
Irelia’s
fading
soul.
Unwilling
to
relinquish
her
home,
Irelia
rose
at
the
brink
of
death,
and
her
father’s
sword
lifted
in
the
air
alongside
her.
Irelia
rushed
back
to
the
fore,
unfazed
by
the
blade's
sudden
animation.
The
weapon
danced
around
her
effortlessly,
cutting
down
Noxians
as
they
gaped
in
horror.
The
decimated
invaders
were
forced
to
retreat
from
the
Placidium.
Irelia
was
appointed
Ionia's
Captain
of
the
Guard,
and
when
the
defense
of
her
homeland
moved
to
the
Fields
of
Justice
,
so
did
she.
The
sword
flourishes,
as
though
painting
with
blood.

Candidate:

CLE
OBSERVATION
An
enormous
four-pronged
blade
parts
the
air
for
Irelia
as
she
enters
the
Great
Hall.
The
unusual
weapon,
once
owned
by
her
father,
hovers
unaided
two
meters
above
the
ground.
Irelia
follows
it
apathetically,
her
mind
focused
on
the
task
at
hand.
Aside
from
her
pristine
armor,
which
is
polished
dutifully
for
presentation,
Irelia
puts
no
effort
into
her
appearance.
Her
face
is
seen
only
in
glimpses
behind
her
swaying
hair.
She's
young,
though
the
youthful
spark
in
her
eyes
is
tarnished
with
the
blood
of
the
battlefield.
She
maintains
a
bold
presence,
fitting
for
the
captain
of
the
Ionian
guard.
Despite
bearing
the
responsibility
of
Ionia's
safety,
her
shoulders
are
as
square
and
resolute
as
her
Mantle
of
Decorum
-
Ionia's
highest
decoration.
The
capricious
sword
darts
ahead
of
her
to
the
marble
doors,
halting
beneath
the
inscription.
There
it
shivers
imperceptibly,
emitting
a
high-pitched
whine.
Whether
because
of
apprehension
or
excitement,
it
is
unclear.
Irelia,
expressionless,
passes
it
and
walks
into
the
blackness.
REFLECTION
The
darkness
set
Irelia
on
edge;
this
was
an
unsafe
manner
in
which
to
conduct
an
interview.
She
felt
the
blade
circling
around
her,
probing
for
threats
she
couldn't
see.
She
hoped
the
agents
of
the
League
had
the
wisdom
to
approach
her
with
care,
as
a
surprise
assault
would
end
unfortunately...
for
them.
Irelia
had
a
knack
for
steel;
it
spoke
to
her.
Closing
her
eyes,
she
extended
her
senses
-
a
meditative
exercise
her
father
taught
her
to
perceive
unseen
threats.
Air
is
the
same
as
water,
you
simply
must
heed
the
ripples.
His
words
echoed
in
her
mind.
What
did
he
always
say
after-
Irelia
flung
herself
into
a
backflip,
the
razor
edge
of
a
knife
slicing
through
the
space
her
head
had
just
occupied.
She
landed
in
a
crouch
as
a
second
knife
raced
through
the
air
toward
her.
She
beckoned
to
her
father's
blade,
but
it
was
nowhere
to
be
found.
Sensing
danger,
she
managed
to
duck
her
head
just
enough
to
evade
the
point
of
the
second
projectile.
She
didn't
flinch
as
the
blade’s
edge
slid
through
her
cheek.
"...every
ripple
is
the
messenger
of
something
yet
to
come."
Master
Lito
appeared
from
the
darkness,
frowning
behind
his
blindfold.
Two
more
knives
were
clenched
between
the
fingers
of
his
left
hand.
"I
smell
blood."
Irelia's
jaw
dropped.
"Father?"
"Don't
try
to
hide
it,
I
can
hear
your
blood
pattering
on
the
shingles."
Irelia
looked
down.
The
red
clay
tiles
of
the
roof
were
unmistakable;
this
was
her
home.
But
she'd
seen
it
succumb
to
the
sickly
green
flames
of
Zaunite
hextorches
years
ago.
"You
know
what
that
means."
Lito
sheathed
the
blades
in
the
blue
folds
of
his
robe.
He
inhaled
sharply,
his
hands
circling
in
front
of
him,
channeling
energy.
Irelia
did
know
what
that
meant:
discipline.
"Father,
wait-",
she
began
to
say.
The
protest
was
futile.
A
loud
snap
announced
his
attack;
Irelia
was
too
slow
to
dodge.
Though
he
stood
twenty
paces
away,
the
long
cloth
from
the
sleeve
of
her
father's
training
robe
lanced
out,
lashing
her
squarely
in
the
chest.
She
hurtled
backward,
sliding
down
the
tiles.
Catching
her
balance,
she
rolled
back
up
the
roof.
Tiles
cracked
as
Lito's
unrelenting
strikes
thundered
after
her.
He
paused
for
a
moment.
"Messy.
Your
mind
is
clouded."
Lito
flicked
his
wrist,
and
cloth
gripped
her
neck
from
across
the
roof.
With
another
flick,
he
brought
Irelia
soaring
toward
him,
yanking
her
off
her
feet.
She
could
faintly
see
her
father's
devastating
roundhouse
kick
coming
to
instill
the
day's
final
lesson,
when
a
red
blur
appeared
in
front
of
it.
"I
thought
I
heard
someone
getting
disciplined.
You
having
trouble,
Irie?"
A
voice
gloated.
"Zelos!"
Irelia
sputtered.
Zelos
was
between
them,
his
right
arm
blocking
the
roundhouse
kick,
and
his
left
hand
holding
his
father's
sleeve
so
she
could
extract
herself.
The
fabric
released
her
neck.
"Here,
I
brought
something
for
you."
He
grinned
at
their
father,
who,
though
blindfolded,
smiled
back.
"It's
only
fair."
Zelos
hurled
a
saber
to
her,
but
before
she
could
grab
it,
Lito's
other
sleeve
plucked
it
from
the
sky.
He
leapt,
spinning
horizontally
in
the
air,
reeling
the
weapon
in.
The
spinning
motion
knocked
Zelos
to
the
tiles.
"Alright,
let's
go!"
Zelos
brandished
a
sword
of
his
own
from
a
sheath
strapped
to
his
back
and
slashed
at
his
father.
The
blow
seemed
to
pass
through
Lito
entirely.
Irelia
sprung
to
her
feet,
flipping
forward
with
a
devastating
axe
kick.
Her
heel
met
the
flat
of
the
saber
Lito
had
intercepted.
Zelos
directed
his
energy
into
his
own
reverse
roundhouse,
and
Lito
was
forced
to
block
the
blow
with
his
arm.
The
saber
clattered
from
the
grip
of
his
sleeve.
Irelia
wasted
no
time
diving
for
the
weapon.
Lito's
sleeve
arced
out
as
she'd
expected,
but
this
time
she
was
ready.
She
landed
on
its
cloth
with
her
right
hand,
pinning
it
to
the
tiles.
She
twisted
her
body
so
that
her
foot
could
kick
the
hilt
of
the
blade,
bouncing
it
up
in
the
air.
Her
other
foot
swung
around
in
mid-air
to
kick
against
the
back
edge
of
the
blade,
launching
the
steel
straight
at
Lito.
He
tore
the
blindfold
from
his
face
as
the
blade
plunged
into
his
stomach.
His
eyes
were
wide.
"Irelia,
what
have
you
done?!"
Lito
choked.
Irelia
stared
at
him
apathetically.
"Had
enough?"
"Irelia,
Dad's
really
hurt!"
Zelos
was
incredulous.
She
nodded.
"Well
he
does
have
a
sword
sticking
out
of
him."
Lito's
pained
expression
vanished,
replaced
with
a
wry
grin.
"Why
do
you
want
to
join
the
League,
Irelia?"
"My
home
was
destroyed
because
I
didn't
have
the
strength
to
protect
it.
I
will
fight
to
the
bitter
death
before
I
let
something
like
that
happen
to
Ionia
again."
Her
tone
was
icy.
"How
does
it
feel,
exposing
your
mind?"
Irelia
laughed
heartily,
a
sound
she'd
almost
forgotten.
"I
thank
you
for
allowing
me
to
set
eyes
on
my
family
again,
but
my
father
would
never
have
let
us
land
a
blow.
He
joined
the
Elders
by
staying
dry
on
this
very
roof
during
a
rainstorm.
According
to
the
records,
he
never
even
moved.
You
can
view
the
images
in
my
mind
all
you
like,
but
you'll
never
appreciate
their
true
nature."
Irelia
found
herself
in
the
waiting
alcove,
doors
closed
in
front
and
behind
her.
Her
father's
blade
bobbed
complacently
beside
her.
With
a
flash,
it
split
into
four
blades,
throwing
all
the
doors
open
around
her.
She
drew
a
great
breath,
and
strode
into
the
League.

Irelia
concept
The
champion
was
officially
revealed
first
in
the
November
issue
of
PC
Gamer
:
Designed
to
be
a
burst
melee
DPS
character
that
thrives
whens
she's
outnumbered,
Irelia's
biggest
weakness
is
stuns
and
other
crowd
control.
Her
abilities
-
a
dash
whose
cooldown
is
refreshed
when
you
successfully
kill
a
target
with
it,
a
passive
boost
to
her
attack
speed
when
surrounded
by
opponents
and
an
ultimate
ability
that
summons
one
or
more
floating
blades
to
fight
alongside
her.

If
you
picked
up
a
copy
of
the
November
issue
of
PC
Gamer,
then
you've
already
had
your
first
look
at
the
League's
latest
champion.
If
you
missed
that
issue,
then
it’s
my
great
honor
to
officially
introduce
Irelia,
the
Will
of
the
Blades.
In
addition
to
being
the
latest
in
our
long
line
of
pretty
ladies
to
join
the
League
of
Legends,
Irelia
serves
as
the
captain
of
the
Ionian
Guard
--
which
only
goes
to
show
that
there's
no
glass
ceiling
when
you
have
a
telekinetic
command
over
swords.
So
watch
yourself!
Irelia
brings
new
meaning
to
the
old
proverb:
"Walk
softly,
but
carry
a
big
sword."
Hey,
wait...
did
I
get
that
right?

(
Original
Stats
)
Ionian
Fervor
(Innate):
Each
nearby
enemy
champion
(to
a
maximum
of
three)
reduces
the
effectiveness
of
crowd
control
on
Irelia.
Bladesurge
(Q)
Irelia
dashes
forward
to
strike
her
target.
If
it
kills
the
target,
Bladesurge's
cooldown
refreshes
and
half
the
mana
cost
is
refunded.
Hiten
Style
(W)
Passive:
Irelia
is
skilled
in
the
art
of
Hiten,
passively
giving
her
physical
attacks
health
restoration.
Active:
Hiten
Style
adds
true
damage
to
her
physical
attacks
for
a
short
duration.
Equilibrium
Strike
(E)
Irelia's
attack
balances
the
scales,
dealing
damage
and
slowing
the
target.
However,
if
the
target
has
a
higher
Health
%
than
Irelia,
then
the
blow
stuns
the
target
instead.
Transcendent
Blades
(Ultimate)
Irelia
summons
four
spirit
blades
which
she
can
fling
at
her
enemies.
These
blades
deal
magic
damage
to
enemies
that
they
pass
through,
siphoning
life
from
them
and
healing
Irelia.
