Turmoil
in
Freljord

Princess
Mauvole
dead;
new
leader
swears
fealty
to
Ashe
Bob
Nashahago
reporting
from
Rakelstake,
Freljord
Princess
Lissandra
is
crowned
in
Rakelstake
after
the
death
of
Princess
Mauvole
–
1
August,
20
CLE
The
freezing
tundra
of
Freljord
is
rapidly
boiling
over
with
a
tense
confrontation,
as
the
current
standoff
between
the
three
tribes
that
have
dominated
the
region
for
decades
suddenly
finds
itself
at
a
possible
conclusion.
One
of
the
rulers
of
the
three
tribes
that
control
this
region
–
Princess
Mauvole,
the
Ice
Dervish
–
was
found
dead
in
her
quarters
three
days
ago
in
the
city
of
Rakelstake.
The
elders
of
her
tribe
determined
the
cause
of
death
to
be
natural,
which
cleared
the
way
for
the
new
Princess,
Lissandra
,
to
claim
her
throne
and
the
title
of
Ice
Dervish.
In
Princess
Lissandra’s
first
act
after
her
coronation,
she
stunned
her
new
subjects
as
she
swore
fealty
to
another
of
the
three
Princesses
of
Freljord:
Ashe,
the
Frost
Archer
.
In
addition
to
her
royal
status,
Ashe
is
also
a
well-known
champion
within
the
League
of
Legends
.
In
her
coronation
speech,
Lissandra
pleaded
with
her
people
that
the
time
had
come
to
unite
Freljord
under
a
single
banner.
"For
too
long,
we
have
endured
hardships
from
external
politics
and
internal
strife.
Today
is
the
day
that
the
citizens
of
the
Freljord
choose
to
end
this
madness,
and
it
begins
from
within.
It
begins
when
we,
the
noble
tribe
of
the
Ice
Dervish,
put
the
needs
of
our
people
above
the
needs
of
our
pride
and
recognize
Princess
Ashe...
as
the
true
power
to
lead
Freljord,
united
and
strong."
Lissandra’s
words
have
seemingly
swayed
her
kin;
her
coronation
speech
was
warmly
received
by
her
tribe,
and
her
tribe’s
elders
have
each
signaled
their
solidarity
with
their
Princesses’
desire
for
unification.
Plans
have
been
made
for
Lissandra
and
Ashe
to
convene
in
Rakelstake
within
the
month.
The
road
to
Freljord
unification
is
far
from
secured,
as
the
third
of
the
Freljord
Princesses
–
Sejuani,
the
Winter's
Claw
–
remains
fiercely
adamant
in
her
opposition
of
the
other
two.
"It's
clear
the
Ice
Dervish
has
lapsed
in
judgment
and
succumbed
to
the
manipulations
of
the
Frost
Archer.
The
'united
Freljord'
the
naive
Lissandra
speaks
of
is
nothing
more
than
a
totalitarian
state
wherein
she
kneels
at
the
right
hand
of
the
tyrant.
So
long
as
I
draw
in
breath,
the
tribe
of
the
Winter's
Claw
will
never
sully
its
name
next
to
those
of
such
conspirators."
Upon
issuing
this
announcement,
Sejuani
retreated
to
isolation
with
the
elders
of
her
tribe.
This
has
caused
concern
amongst
the
members
of
the
other
tribes
in
that
she
may
be
readying
for
war.
When
questioned
about
the
matter,
Ashe
issued
the
following
comment:
"We
pursue
a
future
in
which
our
children
do
not
have
to
fear
their
far-removed
kin,
and
we
may
live
again
in
peace
in
this
land.
Nevertheless,
we
Freljordians
have
borne
the
bite
of
countless
winters,
and
we
have
not
forgotten
how
to
endure."
Why
We
Summon
The
Editor-in-Chief
addresses
the
summoning
layman
Senior
Summoner
Ralston
Farnsley
commenting
from
the
Institute
of
War
I
do
not
think
it
premature
to
declare
the
premier
issue
of
the
Journal
of
Justice
a
success.
Not
to
sound
vainglorious,
but
this
was
certainly
no
surprise
to
me
when
reading
the
copious
amount
of
feedback
we
received.
I
genuinely
feel
that
this
success
is
accredited
to
you,
the
summoners
of
the
League
of
Legends,
and
the
enthusiasm
you
have
for
this
publication.
What
was
surprising
to
me,
however,
was
the
rapid
growth
of
the
JoJ
outside
the
summoning
circles
of
the
Institute
of
War.
People
from
all
walks
of
life
are
looking
to
the
JoJ
as
their
leading
source
of
information
about
Valoran
and
beyond.
For
that,
I
thank
them
–
and
thank
you,
summoners,
for
your
continued
patronage.
It
is
important
for
us
to
be
open
about
our
dealings
–
both
with
the
Journal
and
with
the
League
of
Legends.
As
we
arbitrate
a
multitude
of
sensitive
and
complex
political
issues
from
our
client
city-states,
we
sometimes
forget
the
true
reasons
why
the
League
even
exists.
With
each
passing
day,
fewer
of
us
remember
the
horrors
of
the
last
Rune
War
–
the
fifth
in
a
series
of
cataclysmic
confrontations
involving
powerful
magicians
who
put
their
own
interests
above
all
else.
These
fools
would
rather
have
ruled
over
a
wasteland
of
twisted
magic
than
share
a
responsible
mantle
of
governorship.
Imagine
if
our
beautiful
world
had
succumbed
to
these
petty
tyrants!
What
would
Runeterra
be
like
had
those
who
would
destroy
us
all
been
left
to
lead?
That
would
be
a
world
not
worth
living
in.
For
those
new
to
the
Journal
and
those
new
to
the
ways
of
the
League
–
this
is
why
we
summon.
We
summon
to
resolve
the
conflicts
of
individuals
and
city-states
who,
if
left
unchecked,
would
use
terrible
magic
against
one
another.
We
summon
to
regulate
the
use
of
magic
by
a
civilization
that
has
proven
itself
incapable
of
self-regulation
on
five
separate
occasions.
We
summon
to
ensure
that
there
is
a
world
to
hand
to
our
children
that
is
as
blessed
and
as
bountiful
as
we
enjoy
it
today
–
and
have
done
so
for
the
past
twenty
years.
Starting
with
the
next
issue,
the
Journal
of
Justice
will
answer
select
questions
from
you,
our
readers.
Before
this
begins,
however,
I
felt
it
especially
important
to
speak
plainly
about
the
stakes
of
what
we
do.
The
League
is
more
than
a
simple
court
of
arbitration.
It
is
the
foundation
of
security
and
stability
that
we
all
have
come
to
depend
on
for
nearly
twenty
years.
It
has
a
proven
track
record
of
success.
Who
amongst
us
would
have
imagined
the
day
when
the
likes
of
Demacia
and
Noxus
would
agree
to
settle
their
disputes
without
going
to
war?
This
is
why
I
summon...
for
peace.
Anti-Yordle
Sentiment
Rising
in
Noxus
Revelation
of
proposed
law
stirs
non-human
outrage
Tobias
Drumm
reporting
from
Noxus
The
Noxian
High
Command
is
secretly
considering
a
request
to
ban
yordles
from
within
the
Noxus
city
boundaries,
reports
an
anonymous
source
close
to
the
High
Command.
The
Journal
of
Justice
is
the
first
to
reveal
that
Noxus'
Witherwood
Arcane
College
has
presented
this
request
to
the
High
Command,
along
with
a
secret
report
claiming
that
such
a
ban
would
protect
Noxian
citizens
from
an
unspecified
"contamination."
The
Witherwood
report
also
claims
to
have
significant
evidence
that
all
of
Runeterra’s
non-human
sentient
species
are
in
fact
deformed
descendants
of
ancient
human
tribes.
Of
particular
note
is
the
report’s
alleged
final
claim,
that
this
deformation
was
the
result
of
the
tribes'
failing
to
use
sufficient
quantities
of
magic
in
their
development,
while
more
"enlightened"
civilizations
–
human
civilizations
–
kept
better
control
of
mystic
energies
and
retained
their
"human
purity."
While
our
source
promises
the
anti-yordle
request
is
sure
to
be
rejected
as
secretly
as
it
was
proposed,
the
fact
that
the
Witherwood
report
is
being
read
at
all
is
typical
of
predatory
Noxian
attitudes.
At
least
one
High
Command
officer
was
reported
saying,
"Guess
we
better
use
more
magic,
so
it’s
not
our
children
turning
up
with
fur."
History
Professor
Josin
Darawee
of
the
Grand
Demacian
University
expressed
great
concern
over
the
Witherwood
report.
"These
claims
are
preposterous!
Firstly,
five
minutes’
study
of
history
proves
that
non-humans
have
existed
on
Runeterra
as
long
as
their
human
cousins.
Second,
to
imply
that
increased
sorcery
makes
its
users
MORE
safe
is
the
worst
kind
of
delusion,
an
attempt
to
turn
the
horrors
of
the
Rune
Wars
into
nothing
more
than
'we’ll
hit
you
first!'
No
surprise
it’s
some
of
Noxus'
magical
weapons
consultants
that
'discovered'
it!"
The
abuse
of
yordles
and
other
non-humans
in
Noxus
has
been
a
source
of
longtime
concern,
although
it
usually
takes
the
form
of
harsh
attitudes
on
the
Noxian
street
rather
than
official
pressure.
Away
from
the
city,
non-humans
such
as
the
Great
Barrier
minotaurs
have
historically
been
as
likely
as
humans
to
face
Noxian
raids.
Noxus'
small
community
of
non-humans,
mostly
visitors
to
the
city,
appeared
to
have
no
knowledge
of
the
Witherwood
report.
Yordles
in
particular
refused
to
comment,
although
several
that
were
interviewed
were
then
seen
rapidly
packing
their
belongings.
League
Champion
Katarina
,
speaking
on
behalf
of
Noxus,
denied
that
the
Witherwood
report
was
ever
made.
She
added,
"Noxus
has
always
treated
every
contributing
member
as
fairly
as
they
deserve.
Really,
would
any
Noxian
official
even
leak
such
an
absurd
story
to
the
news,
or
expect
to
live
if
he
did?
Instead
of
repeating
obvious
Demacian
lies,
any
yordles
afraid
their
people
are
being
mistreated
in
Noxus
should
sign
up
for
our
northern
barbarian-pacification
campaign
to
remind
us
how
clever
those
little
hands
are
in
aiming
a
weapon."
UnaVoidable
Musings
(Believe
Me,
I’ve
Tried)
Inquiries
regarding
the
League’s
latest
oddballs
L.B.
Briskes
commenting
from
My
Living
Room
Any
good
sideshow
needs
its
freak,
right?
After
all,
without
bearded
ladies
and
three-armed
giants,
how
else
could
we
abide
calling
ourselves
normal?
Naturally,
when
the
peculiar
Cho'Gath
made
his
controversial
debut
in
the
League
of
Legends,
it
did
not
falter
my
derisive
scoff.
We've
certainly
seen
stranger
and
more
sensational
things
in
Valoran
.
When
Kassadin
arrived
with
his
amusing
doomsday
prophecies
and
mystically
purple
bag-of-tricks,
I
barely
paused
whilst
trimming
a
pesky
hangnail.
However,
the
advent
of
Malzahar
–
and
now
Kog'Maw
–
positively
jars
my
otherwise
blissful
contemptibility
with
uninvited
questions
concerning
their
allegedly
otherworldly
origins.
All
claim
–
some
vocally,
others
visually
–
to
have
traveled
from
the
malevolent,
ominous,
and
above
all,
spooky
Void.
Evidence
supporting
these
claims
varies
haphazardly
from
the
occasional
summoned
bug-critter
to
the
wanton
engorgement
of
man-
or
minotaur-sized
objects,
but
the
facts
seem
to
merit
a
moment’s
consideration.
Stories
of
the
Void
can
be
traced
back
to
the
lost
city
of
Icathia
,
a
place
with
about
as
much
proof
that
it
ever
existed
as
you
find
competitive
yordle
high-jumpers
(rockets
excluded,
cheaters).
The
believers
generally
agree
that
Icathia
was
located
in
the
Southern
half
of
Valoran
somewhere,
though
details
become
muddled
there.
Many
explorers
have
struck
out
to
discover
the
place,
but
the
only
fact
their
findings
universally
corroborate
is
that
just
about
everywhere
south
of
the
Great
Barrier
is
malevolent,
ominous,
and
spooky.
The
absence
of
evidence
is
not
the
evidence
of
absence,
but
surely
after
so
very
many
forays
into
the
southern
wilds,
someone
would
have
found
some
lingering
scrap
of
an
entire
civilization,
right?
Well
that
discounts
the
appreciable
number
of
pioneers
who
have
never
returned.
Furthermore,
the
fringe
Void
fanatics
submit
theories
of
magical
intervention,
citing
cases
in
which
explorers
have
reported
time
discrepancies
from
their
travels,
as
though
days
were
stolen.
I
have
experienced
similar
time
discrepancies
myself,
and
in
the
following
mornings
I
often
find
empty
bottles
or
glasses
that
I
swore
were
full
the
night
before.
Intrepid
journalist
that
I
am,
I
ventured
to
Summoner's
Rift
after
an
exhibition
match
for
any
comment
from
the
aforementioned
champions
which
would
quell
this
nagging
curiosity
and
restore
the
apathy
I’ve
come
to
enjoy.
Cho'Gath’s
and
Kog'Maw's
comments
were
tantamount
to
projectile
vomit,
both
in
eloquence
and
relevance...also
literally.
Malzahar
only
grinned
in
the
sort
of
manner
I’ve
come
to
expect
from
serial
killers
and
postmen,
promising
that
I’ll
"soon
learn
everything
I
need
to
know."
Though
I
never
mentioned
my
investigations
of
formulas
to
sterilize
people
afflicted
by
idiocy,
I
do
hope
he
is
correct.
Kassadin
offered
perhaps
the
most
insightful
response,
stating,
"You
do
not
understand
that
which
you
seek."
He
provided
further
useful
information,
"Cho'Gath
and
Kog'Maw
cannot
be
trusted."
My
spittle-soaked
boots
wish
I’d
conducted
this
interview
first.
So
laden
with
this
deluge
of
knowledge,
I’ll
leave
you
as
informed
as
you
were
prior
to
reading
my
article,
which
I
can
only
assume
means
that
-
if
Malzahar
is
truly
correct
-
you’ll
also
have
an
inoculation
coming.
The
Loyal
Heart
Beats
Eternal
A
commentary
on
Noxian
philosophy,
service,
and
League
Champion
Sion
Richor
Ebony
commenting
from
Noxus
It
has
been
said
that
as
one
ascends
to
power,
one
loses
friends.
While
one
can
debate
the
merits
of
humility
until
the
sun
hangs
low
in
the
sky,
suffice
to
say
it
is
no
secret
that
my
homeland,
the
principality
of
Noxus,
has
acquired
more
than
its
fair
share
of
partisans
over
the
years.
Regardless
of
your
personal
feelings
towards
the
High
Command,
however,
there
are
few
who
could
challenge
our
dedication
to
the
loyal.
For
the
sake
of
illustration,
allow
me
to
cite
the
example
of
the
Noxian
warrior
known
as
Sion
.
A
staunch
supporter
of
our
Eternal
General,
as
well
as
a
soldier
of
high
regard,
Sion’s
fervor
on
the
field
before
his
accident
carried
him
to
victory
in
many
battles.
His
fame
and
renown
spread
to
the
far
corners
of
Valoran,
and
even
where
his
name
was
not
revered,
it
was
rightfully
feared.
It
could
be
said
that
the
very
quality
that
made
this
warrior’s
career
also
brought
it
to
its
end.
Sion
zealously
engaged
a
Demacian
force
that
was
a
bit
too
well-entrenched
–
even
for
a
warrior
of
his
considerable
skill.
He
was
captured
and
executed.
His
body
was
sent
back
to
Demacia
as
an
accolade
to
the
so-called
justice
of
King
Jarvan
III.
But
respect
for
the
dead
takes
many
forms,
and
Noxus
does
not
so
easily
abandon
its
own
to
adorn
the
battlements
of
an
insolent
enemy
in
tribute
to
foreign
law.
Galvanized
by
their
champion’s
heroic
death,
the
assassins
of
Noxus
–
under
the
command
of
Katarina,
the
famed
Sinister
Blade
–
undertook
a
dangerous
mission
to
recover
Sion’s
mortal
remains.
The
Demacian
propaganda
machine
may
try
to
spin
whatever
fantastic
story
it
wishes;
our
successful
venture
is
plainly
now
a
matter
of
public
record.
In
Noxus,
for
a
true
soldier,
death
does
not
have
to
be
the
end.
The
necromancers
of
the
Bleak
Academy
have
ways
of
preserving
the
ardent.
Within
Sion’s
still
heart,
that
same
rage
–
that
same
glorious
fervor
that
had
made
him
the
unstoppable
juggernaut
he
was
in
life
–
still
burned.
Even
now,
Sion
serves
Noxus.
He
shall
always
serve
Noxus
–
an
eternal
champion
of
our
banner,
stalwartly
defending
the
interests
of
the
state
on
the
Field
of
Justice.
This
is
his
just
reward
for
a
life
of
dedication
to
the
advancement
of
the
Empire,
and
to
the
glory
of
the
High
Command.
This
is
any
true
Noxian
loyalist’s
ultimate
reward.
Forever
strong!
