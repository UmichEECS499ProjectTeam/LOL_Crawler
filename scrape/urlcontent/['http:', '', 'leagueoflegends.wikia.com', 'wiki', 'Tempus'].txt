Trivia
Janna
was
designed
by
Brackhar
.
Janna
is
voiced
by
Erin
Fitzgerald
,
who
also
voices
Sona
.
Her
title
was
previously
"The
Avatar
of
Air".
In
some
languages,
she
still
retains
this
title,
such
as
French
("L'avatar
De
L'air").
Janna's
background
story
is
possibly
inspired
from
the
character
Storm
from
the
X-Men
franchise.
Storm
was
a
street
child
who
lived
off
her
wits
and
thievery,
until
discovering
her
own
powers,
which
led
to
her
being
revered
by
her
fellow
citizens.
Janna's
name
is
almost
homophonous
with
the
word
"Jannah"(sometimes
also
pronouced
as
"Jannath"
in
Arabic.
It
means
"Heaven"
or
"Paradise"
or
"Bliss"
in
English.
Janna
is
the
only
champion
that
can
shield
turrets.
Janna's
dance
is
a
reference
to
Dance
Studio's
choreography
to
Jazz-Funk.
A
side-by-side
comparison
can
be
seen
here
.
Forecast
Janna
references
the
dance
from
"
I'm
Singing
in
the
Rain
".
A
side-by-side
comparison
can
be
seen
here
.
Janna
was
the
first
champion
to
receive
a
visual
rework.
Ezreal
(person)
confirmed
that
Janna's
last
name
is
Windforce.
[1]
Quotes
As
of
Patch
V1.0.0.102
,
Janna
gained
a
new
voice
actor
and
lines.
Janna's
old
voiceovers
was
made
to
sound
like
the
wind
was
blowing
while
she
spoke.
A
video
containing
her
old
quotes
before
this
change
can
be
found
here
.
Janna
received
a
new
joke
after
her
patch
update.
She
begins
to
say
one
of
her
old
quotes
in
her
old
voice,
before
coughing
and
apologizing
in
her
new
voice,
saying
she
doesn't
know
what
came
over
her.
Janna's
second
joke
"Yes,
it's
true.
For
only
$2.95
a
minute,
I
will
leave
you
breathless."
is
a
reference
to
many
television
commercials
for
adult
phone
hotlines.
Janna
is
one
of
the
few
champions
that
have
had
their
voiceovers
changed.
Others
are
Anivia
,
Katarina
and
Karma
.
Janna's
old
quote,
"I
float
on
wings
of
truth",
is
similar
to
Vayne's
quote,
"On
wings
of
night",
and
Shyvana's
quote,
"On
wings
of
fury".
Skins
Janna
is
one
of
the
first
champions
to
have
her
in-game
model
redone
based
off
the
Chinese
Splash
Art.
Classic
Janna
,
both
Chinese
and
American,
shows
marks
on
her
shoulders.
However,
they
are
not
seen
on
her
in-game
model.
Tempest
Janna
may
be
a
reference
to
the
character
Storm
from
the
X-Men
franchise.
Frost
Queen
Janna
is
possibly
a
reference
to
Shiva
,
a
summoned
being
from
the
Final
Fantasy
series,
particularly
her
Final
Fantasy
IX
appearance.
Victorious
Janna
is
possibly
a
reference
to
Rosa
Joanna
Farrel
,
a
White
Mage
from
Baron
and
a
childhood
friend
of
Cecil
Harvey
and
Kain
Highwind
.
On
the
Forecast
Janna
splash
art
Teemo
can
be
seen
floating
on
the
right,
and
on
the
left
down
corner
of
the
art
there
is
what
seems
to
be
a
Turret
.
The
Romanian
voice
over
of
Forecast
Janna
includes
a
reference
to
the
most
known
Romanian
newscaster.
On
the
updated
Splash
art
for
Forecast
Janna
she
has
a
necklace
with
the
RGN
News
tag
on
her
neck.
Relations
Janna
is
said
to
have
tutored
Karma
in
utilizing
of
her
fans
for
battle.
Janna
was
once
matched
through
Blitzcrank's
dating
service
with
the
journalist
Bob
Nashahago
.
It
is
unknown
if
they
intended
to
date
one
another,
considering
Nashahago
had
been
dating
Nidalee
at
the
time.
[2]
In
the
Lore,
Janna
originally
lived
in
the
city-state
of
Zaun
.
Pictures
of
Janna
wearing
lingerie
were
made
public,
much
to
her
dismay.
It
is
unknown
if
these
pictures
were
taken
professionally
or
without
her
permission,
although
it
has
been
suggested
that
this
was
the
work
of
an
ex-boyfriend.
[3]
[4]
Janna
has
piloted
the
zeppelin,
"Tailwind",
and
won
a
race
during
the
annual
Techmaturgical
Conference
as
the
representative
of
Piltover
,
defeating
the
Zaunite
competitors
aboard
their
flagship

Zeppelin."
