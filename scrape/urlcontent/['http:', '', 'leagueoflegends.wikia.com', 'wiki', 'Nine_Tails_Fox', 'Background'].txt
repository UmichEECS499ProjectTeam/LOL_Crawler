Unlike
other
foxes
that
roamed
the
woods
of
southern
Ionia
,
Ahri
had
always
felt
a
strange
connection
to
the
magical
world
around
her;
a
connection
that
was
somehow
incomplete.
Deep
inside,
she
felt
the
skin
she
had
been
born
into
was
an
ill
fit
for
her
and
dreamt
of
one
day
becoming
human.
Her
goal
seemed
forever
out
of
reach,
until
she
happened
upon
the
wake
of
a
human
battle.
It
was
a
grisly
scene,
the
land
obscured
by
the
forms
of
wounded
and
dying
soldiers.
She
felt
drawn
to
one:
a
robed
man
encircled
by
a
waning
field
of
magic
whose
life
was
quickly
slipping
away.
She
approached
him
and
something
deep
inside
of
her
triggered,
reaching
out
to
the
man
in
a
way
she
couldn't
understand.
His
life
essence
poured
into
her,
carried
on
invisible
strands
of
magic.
The
sensation
was
intoxicating
and
overwhelming.
As
her
reverie
faded,
she
was
delighted
to
discover
that
she
had
changed.
Her
sleek
white
fur
had
receded
and
her
body
was
long
and
lithe,
the
shape
of
the
humans
who
lay
scattered
about
her.
However,
though
she
appeared
human,
she
knew
that
in
truth
the
transformation
was
incomplete.
A
cunning
creature,
she
adapted
herself
to
the
customs
of
human
society
and
used
her
profound
gift
of
beauty
to
attract
unsuspecting
men.
She
could
consume
their
life
essences
when
they
were
under
the
spell
of
her
seductive
charms.
Feeding
on
their
desires
brought
her
closer
to
her
dream,
but
as
she
took
more
lives,
a
strange
sense
of
regret
began
to
well
within
her.
She
had
reservations
about
actions
which
never
troubled
her
as
a
fox.
She
realized
that
she
could
not
overcome
the
pangs
of
her
evolving
morality.
In
search
of
a
solution,
Ahri
found
the
Institute
of
War
,
home
of
the
most
gifted
mages
on
Runeterra
.
They
offered
her
a
chance
to
attain
her
humanity
without
further
harm
through
service
in
the
League
of
Legends
.
"Mercy
is
a
human
luxury...
and
responsibility."

Sneak
Peek
Announcement
made
in
the
Sneak
Peek
by
Average
Gatsby
[1]
:
Summoners!
Occasionally
we
debut
future
champions
a
bit
ahead
of
time
because
we’re
super
excited
about
them
and
we
just
can’t
contain
ourselves!
Let
us
introduce
you
to
our
take
on
the
Asian
legend
of
The
Nine
Tails
Fox:
Ahri,
the
Nine-Tailed
Fox
We
think
her
combination
of
strength,
beauty,
power
and
grace
will
yield
a
fun
and
amazing
champion
to
play!
While
she
is
very
early
in
development,
here’s
a
little
sneak
peak
at
what
she’ll
be
able
to
do:
Based
on
the
story
of
a
fox
who
wanted
nothing
more
than
to
become
human,
this
champion
will
be
a
ranged
caster
who
utilizes
her
Fox
Bead
to
decimate
her
opponents
on
the
battlefield.
She’s
going
to
be
extremely
agile
and
versatile,
using
her
nine
tails
to
maneuver
in
and
out
of
combat
with
style
and
grace.
She
will
also
make
use
of
her
Fox
Fire,
where
she
will
summon
balls
of
fire
which
will
seek
out
and
destroy
nearby
enemies.
She’s
very
early
in
development,
so
as
always
her
abilities
and
artwork
are
subject
to
change,
but
we
hope
you’re
as
excited
about
her
as
we
are!

Greetings
Summoners!
Back
in
the
end
of
September,
we
announced
The
Nine
Tails
Fox
much
to
the
excitement
of
our
community.
Well
the
time
has
finally
come
and
after
much
anticipation,
we
wanted
to
reveal
the
gameplay
style
for
Ahri,
the
Nine-Tailed
Fox.
Ahri's
gameplay
style
revolves
around
mobility
and
managing
position
to
aim
her
spells.
When
played
properly,
Ahri
darts
around
teamfights,
picking
off
wounded
stragglers
and
harrying
soft
enemies.
This
is
largely
accomplished
through
her
ultimate,
which
allows
her
to
dash
multiple
times
before
going
on
cooldown.
Ahri
can
either
use
all
three
quickly
to
chase,
burst,
or
escape,
or
she
can
spread
out
their
uses
to
keep
enemies
guessing
and
juke
around
the
battlefield.
Combining
this
with
her
high
magic
damage
and
her
Seduction
ability
to
lock
enemies
down,
she
can
strike
from
unexpected
angles
or
bait
enemies
into
over-committing
to
disadvantageous
situations.
Ahri's
major
gameplay
decisions
are
based
on
her
assessment
of
risk/reward.
Her
burst
is
high,
but
must
be
in
short
range
to
maximize
it.
This
creates
a
dynamic
that
requires
her
to
endanger
herself
to
reach
full
potential.
Play
it
safe
and
have
more
light
damage,
or
commit
and
go
for
the
kill?
Use
your
dash
for
damage,
or
save
it
for
escape?
The
choices
are
constant
with
these
opposed
strengths
and
weaknesses.
Her
kit
is
really
designed
to
appeal
towards
opportunistic
players
who
prefer
characters
with
a
lot
of
action,
and
especially
players
that
like
to
lull
enemies
into
overconfidence,
only
to
capitalize
and
punish
them.
Ahri's
dangerous,
seductive
nature
is
something
we're
happy
to
deliver
for
players
who
like
to
toy
with
their
enemies
before
destroying
them.
