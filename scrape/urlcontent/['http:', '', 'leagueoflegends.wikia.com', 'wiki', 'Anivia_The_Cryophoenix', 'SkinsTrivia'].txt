Trivia
The
name
Anivia
is
derived
from
Latin
niveus/nivea/niveum
,
meaning
"Snow
White".
Anivia
was
designed
by
Brackhar
.
Anivia's
dance
is
the
Chicken
Dance
.
A
side-by-side
comparison
can
be
seen
here
.
The
quote
at
the
end
of
Anivia
'
s
lore
alludes
to
the
Robert
Frost
poem
Fire
and
Ice
.
"Cryophoenix"
is
derived
from
two
words:
"Cryo"
and
"Phoenix".
Cryo
from
the
Greek
word
cryos
meaning
"cold",
while
the
"
phoenix
"
is
a
mythic
creature
with
the
power
to
reincarnate
itself
from
its
own
ashes;
the
classic
phoenix
being
a
birdlike
creature
that
is
partially
on
fire.
If
Anivia
types
in
chat
while
she
is
in
egg
form,
instead
of
saying
"Anivia"
after
the
player's
name,
it
will
say
"Eggnivia"
instead.
Anivia
is
one
of
only
two
champions
to
have
had
her
in-game
voice
changed
twice.
The
other
is
Katarina
.
Her
first
voice
over
made
her
sound
more
aggressive.
A
video
containing
it
can
be
seen
here
.
Her
second
voice
over
was
the
calmest
of
the
three,
and
can
be
heard
here
.
Anivia's
profile
page
splash
art
in
the
new
beta
site
for
League
of
Legends
shows
her
Chinese
art.
This
might
hint
that
Riot
is
planning
to
replace
her
current
splash
art
with
the
Chinese
art.
[1]
Anivia
is
the
only
non-humanoid
champion
that
is
female.
(
Elise
,
Shyvana
and
Nidalee
have
human
forms).
Quotes
Blackfrost
Anivia
shares
a
quote
with
Traditional
Sejuani
;
"To
the
bitter
end".
Blackfrost
Anivia
'
s
quote
"The
abyss
speaks
through
me,"
is
similar
to
Karma
'
s
quote
"Ionia
speaks
through
me."
Skins
Bird
of
Prey
Anivia
is
designed
after
a
Bald
Eagle
.
Bird
of
Prey
Anivia
is
holding
a
Philosopher's
Stone
in
one
of
her
talons.
Hextech
Anivia
bears
a
striking
resemblance
to
Clockwerk
from
the
Sly
Cooper
video
game
series.
The
theme
behind
Anivia's
legendary
Blackfrost
skin
is
one
of
the
possible
outcomes
of
the
upcoming
Freljord
War.
In
this
alternative
future,
Anivia
failed
to
defeat
the
evil
that
was
corrupting
the
ice
and
Anivia
succumbed
to
its
poison.
Blackfrost
Anivia
bears
strong
resemblance
to
the
demon
Black
Frost
from
the
Shin
Megami
Tensei
series,
as
he
is
the
darkened
variant
of
the
snow
fairy
Jack
Frost
and
also
shares
the
purple
and
black
colors
of
this
skin.
[2]
Relations
Anivia
has
formed
a
close
friendship
with
a
few
League
champions:
Nunu
and
his
yeti,
Willump,
as
well
as
Ashe
,
the
Queen
of
Freljord
.
From
the
Journal
of
Justice
,
Anivia
can
be
seen
attending
Ashe
and
Tryndamere's
coronation
as
Freljord's
new
Queen
and
King.
Anivia
has
a
nest
on
the
northern
slopes
of
Ironspike
Mountains
.
Greyor
mentioned
about
a
sacrifice
Anivia
had
done.
She
had
probably
died
during
the
War
of
the
Howling
Abyss
.
