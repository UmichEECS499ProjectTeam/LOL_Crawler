Bonus
health
Each
health
bar
represents
at
most
100
health.
Health
(commonly
known
as
HP
,
an
abbreviation
for
H
ealth/
H
it
P
oints)
is
the
amount
of
life
a
unit
or
structure
has.
Max
health
is
the
cap
on
life
any
unit
can
have.
Current
health
is
directly
reduced
by
damage
and
is
regained
in
many
different
ways.
Every
unit
and
structure
has
their
max
and
current
health
displayed
as
a
bar
above
their
models.
When
displayed
over
a
champion's
model
in
game,
the
health
meter
is
displayed
as
segmented
bars.
The
green
health
bar
on
top,
and
the
blue
mana
Bar
at
the
bottom.
Additionally,
for
your
own
champion,
it
is
represented
in
the
interface
as
a
green
bar
with
two
numbers
(
#
/
#
):
the
first
one
represents
the
actual
life
available
at
the
moment,
while
the
second
is
the
maximum
amount
of
health
the
champion
can
have.
If
a
champion's
health
reaches
zero
and
he
doesn't
have
any
abilities
preventing
it,
death
will
occur.
Max
health
scales
additively
with
every
bonus
health
point
and
increases
with
each
level,
meaning
that
each
bonus
point
acquired
directly
affects
the
statistic.
At
level
18
base
health
ranges
from
Anivia's
1610
health
to
Alistar's
2278
health.

for

Effective
Health
Effective
health
is
considered
as
the
amount
of
health
that
a
champion
has
plus
1%
per
unit
of
defense
as
extra
health
due
to
damage
reduction.
In
other
words,
effective
health
is
the
amount
of
damage
the
enemy
needs
to
kill
the
champion.
For
example,
a
champion
with
1000
HP
and
0
armor
and
an
enemy
with
auto-attacks
that
deals
100
damage,
then
the
champion
needs
to
deal
1000
damage
before
reduction
to
kill
the
target.
If
the
champion
has
100
armor,
the
champion
prevents
50%
of
the
damage
so
the
enemy
deals
50
damage
with
each
auto-attack.
Therefore,
as
each
auto-attack
deals
half
damage
and
the
enemy
needs
to
execute
double
the
amount
of
auto-attacks
to
deal
1000
damage.
So
the
enemy
instead
of
dealing
1000
damage
before
reduction
to
kill
the
target,
the
champion
has
to
deal
2000
damage
before
reduction
to
kill
the
target.
There
is
effective
health
for
physical
damage
and
for
magical
damage.
In
short
the
formula
is:
Physical
Effective
Health
=
Max
Health
×
(1
+
(
Armor
/
100))
Magical
Effective
Health
=
Max
Health
×
(1
+
(
Magic
Resist
/

Effective

Maximum
health
These
abilities
grant
extra
damage
based

the

maximum
health.
Typically,
the
more
maximum
health
the

has,
the
more

these

will
deal.
Therefore,
they
are
more
powerful
against
high-health
targets,

their
effect
against
low-health
targets
should
not
be
ignored.
Also
note
this
