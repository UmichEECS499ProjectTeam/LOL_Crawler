Blessing.
Healing
refers
to
the
ability
to
restore
health
to
a
unit.
Healing
(heals)
are
distinct
from
other
forms
of
health
restoration
(
life
steal
,
spell
vamp
and
health
regeneration
).
Healing
cannot
restore
a
unit's
health
over
its
maximum,
as
with
all
other
health
restoration.
Healing
also
does
not
refer
to
maximum
health
gained
from
abilities.
