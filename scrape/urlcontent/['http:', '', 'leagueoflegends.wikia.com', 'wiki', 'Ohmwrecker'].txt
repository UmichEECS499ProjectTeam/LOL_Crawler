Gold
Efficiency
The
base
stats
are
101.1%
gold
efficient,
without
the
active.
Strategy
Turrets
deal
increasing
damage
on
successive
hits;
Ohmwrecker
resets
the
damage
increase
when
disabling
the
turret.
If
there
are
2
turrets
in
range,
as
they
are
in
Nexus
Turrets
in
Summoners'
Rift,
both
turrets
are
affected.
Ohmwrecker
can
be
used
for
backdoor
attempts
as
the
team
can
siege
a
turret
without
the
support
of
a
minion
wave
by
using
the
active.
This
strategy
can
be
practiced
alone
by
some
champions
at
the
cost
of
some
health
(or
no
cost
if
the
turret
is
already
at
low
health)
Ohmwrecker
is
useful
for
champions
that
are
powerful
turret
divers
with
high
or
decent
AP
ratios
(i.e.
Fizz
or
Poppy
)
Trivia
Ohmwrecker
is
named
after
Ohmwrecker
aka
the
Masked
Gamer
as
a
reward
for
gaining
over
1000
referrals.
Up
until
it
closed
in
June
of
2012
Ohmwrecker
served
as
the
Editor-in-Chief
of
Voodoo
Extreme,
a
popular
gaming
site
that
covered
League
of
Legends
extensively
when
most
other
sites
disregarded
it
as
an
insignificant
free-to-play
game.
Ohmwrecker
was
also
recognized
as
a
winner
in
the
"
Minnows
to
Sharks
[2]
"
program
that
Riot
ran
shortly
after
League
of
Legends
launched,
he
provided
consultation
to
Riot's
executive
management
that
helped
lead
to
the
Summoner
Showcase
and
Tribunal,
and
he
served
for
a
short
time
as
an
original
Test
Realm
tester.
Ohmwrecker
now
focuses
on
building
his
Youtube
channel
[3]
as
a
partner
of
the
Polaris
Network,
formerly
known
as
The
Game
Station.
Ohmwrecker
is
phonetically
similar
to
"homewrecker",
in
reference
to
its
effect.
Incidentally,
an
'ohm'
is
a
unit
of
electrical
resistance,
and
so
the
name
may
also
be
understood
as
"resistance
wrecker".
