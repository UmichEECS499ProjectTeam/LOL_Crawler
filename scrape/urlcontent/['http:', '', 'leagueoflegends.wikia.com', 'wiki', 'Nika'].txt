Profile
Originally
referred
to
as
the
faceless
mythical
creature
named
“Star,”
Nikasaur
grew
up
in
the
lawless,
unforgiving
jungles
of
the
internet
amongst
music-worshipping
natives
before
she
discovered
the
dangerous
oasis
of
video
games.
Abandoning
the
temperate
SoCal
climate,
she
migrated
to
spend
a
year
in
captivity
at
Telltale
Games
where
she
blogged
and
perfected
the
art
of
sneak-attack
hugs
until
Riot
offered
her
warmer
weather
and
proximity
to
the
largest
corporate
collection
of
shake
weights
in
the
world.
She
is
fluent
in
Typo,
LOLcat
and
Italics,
and
easily
identified
by
her
colorful
plumage
and
shrieking
call.
Special
Ability
Cachinnate
:
Nikasaur
emits
explosive
laughter,
stunning
all
humans
in
a
cone
and
inspiring
raised
eyebrows
in
adjoining
rooms.
Trivia
Nikasaur
was
the
hostess
of
Summoner
Showcase.
