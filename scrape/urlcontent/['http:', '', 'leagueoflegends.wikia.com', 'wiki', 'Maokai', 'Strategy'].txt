Sap
Magic
gives
him
a
lot
of
staying
power
during
the
lane
phase,
especially
if
facing/laning
with
champions
that
spam
skills
like
Evelynn
,
Akali
,
Cassiopeia
,
or
Karthus
.
Using
your
abilities
at
the
start
of
a
game
to
charge
your
passive
grants
you
a
small
burst
of
health
after
taking
damage
in
a
level
one
skirmish.
Sap
Magic
will
not
trigger
when
attacking
structures.
If
fighting
under
a
tower,
be
sure
to
attack
nearby
minions
if
you
need
the
heal.
Sap
Magic
does
not
trigger
when
you
are
at
full
health
,
so
do
not
be
afraid
of
last
hitting
minions
at
full
health
while
this
ability
is
up.
When
used
close
enough
Arcane
Smash
causes
a
small
knock-up
in
addition
to
the
slow
it
provides,
use
this
to
interrupt
channeled
spells
such
as
Katarina's
Death
Lotus
or
Nunu's
Absolute
Zero
.
Flash
and
Twisted
Advance
can
make
a
surprise
grab
and
provide
an
opportunity
to
open
a
team
fight.
Maokai
is
a
great
initiator
and
has
good
tower
diving/chasing
capability
thanks
to
Twisted
Advance
.
His
Sapling
Toss
is
also
able
to
chase
retreating
enemies
past
their
towers
and
possibly
kill
them.
Maokai
can
farm
using
Sapling
Toss
,
as
mid-game
the
sapling
can
kill
3-5
minions
easily.
The
Sapling
deals
damage
twice:
once
upon
impact
and
another
after
a
short
delay.
It
can
also
be
used
to
damage
enemies
in
brush
safely.
Use
Sapling
Toss
to
harass
enemies
in
the
lane.
Try
to
overshoot
your
target
slightly,
just
enough
to
get
the
impact
damage
and
allowing
the
enemy
to
dodge
into
the
explosion.
Try
to
aim
your
saplings
so
there
are
no
enemy
minions
nearby
to
trigger
them,
as
they
may
choose
to
explode
on
them
rather
than
the
desired
champion.
You
can
also
use
it
to
zone
out
enemies
by
placing
them
behind
the
enemy
minions,
forcing
the
enemy
to
duck
away
from
experience
range
or
take
damage.
Champions
with
Boots
of
Speed
can
outrun
the
sapling
quite
easily,
making
this
form
of
lane-control
mainly
effective
at
the
very
start
of
a
game.
Saplings
won't
detonate
on
stealthed
enemies,
but
can
hit
them.
This
is
very
useful
if
the
enemy
tries
to
flee
through
both
minions
and
stealth.
By
using
Sapling
Toss
multiple
times
in
a
bush,
stacking
them
on
top
of
each
other,
you
can
catch
unsuspecting
enemies
off
guard
resulting
in
a
huge
burst
of
damage
if
they
walk
into
your
saplings.
Vengeful
Maelstrom
is
not
a
channeled
spell,
so
Maokai
is
free
to
use
other
skills
while
supporting
his
teammates.
Remember
to
deactivate
right
before
all
enemies
leave
the
AoE
,
or
else
they
will
suffer
no
damage.
Vengeful
Maelstrom
is
very
useful
when
the
battle
ground
is
stationary,
such
as
during
a
tower
push
or
defense.
Using
it
in
the
open
will
usually
cause
enemies
to
run
out
of
it,
wasting
its
potential
unless
you
want
them
to
go
away.
During
a
push,
however,
the
designated
fighting
grounds
remains
around
the
tower,
which
forces
the
enemy
team
to
fight
on
your
terms.
Small
skirmishes
in
the
jungle
or
even
the
occasional
team
fight
are
good
times
to
use
Vengeful
Maelstrom
,
as
escape
routes
are
few
and
the
fighting
ground
is
often
crowded
and
fast
paced.
The
damage
output
from
Vengeful
Maelstrom
is
very
powerful
with
some
ability
power
.
Using
it
in
team
fights
to
hit
as
many
enemies
as
possible
can
turn
the
tide
greatly
in
your
teams
favor.
Vengeful
Maelstrom
is
good
for
small
skirmishes
in
laning
as
well.
If
you
aren't
sure
you
can
kill
your
enemy
with
the
normal
E-W-Q
combo,
throw
down
Vengeful
Maelstrom
to
add
that
extra
bit
of
damage
you
may
need.
Use
Vengeful
Maelstrom
while
tanking
minion
waves
to
quickly
kill
minions
and
shut
down
the
enemy's
push.
Vengeful
Maelstrom
can
be
very
useful
for
a
kamikaze
operation.
A
fully
built
Maokai
can
easily
store
up
the
300
bonus
damage
when
1
v
4
thanks
to
Sap
Magic
.
In
addition
to
free
hits
while
they
try
to
kill
you,
the
resulting
nuke
from
Vengeful
Maelstrom
can
often
get
an
unexpected
kill.
Place
it
over
enemies
and
yourself
should
you
expect
the
enemy
to
focus
on
you,
reducing
your
damage
taken
while
possibly
let
it
cause
more
to
enemies.
Place
it
over
allies
if
you
expect
enemies
to
aggressively
attack
them
instead.
Enemies
running
from
Vengeful
Maelstrom
isn't
necessarily
a
problem,
as
long
as
you
are
damaging
them
while
they
flee
from
it.
With
Arcane
Smash
,
Twisted
Advance
and
even
other
allied
crowd-control
effects,
the
enemy
fleeing
Vengeful
Maelstrom
can
allow
your
team
to
do
a
lot
of
damage
upon
them
without
receiving
reprisal
before
they
escape
the
circle.
Vengeful
Maelstrom
is
a
great
counter
against
other
champs'
AoE
ults.
Activate
Vengeful
Maelstrom
during
a
channel
such
as
Absolute
Zero
or
Death
Lotus
to
absorb
some
damage
and
later
retaliate
with
some
of
your
own.
Maokai's
typical
initiation
is
using
Sapling
Toss
,
rooting
them
near
the
sapling
with
Twisted
Advance
to
ensure
the
sapling
explodes
on
them,
and
finishing
off
with
Arcane
Smash
.
Waiting
until
the
root
is
just
about
to
end
before
using
his
knock-up
on
Arcane
Smash
increases
disable
time
on
them
as
well.
If
a
team
battle
is
about
to
start,
use
Vengeful
Maelstrom
after
you
jump
in
with
your
Twisted
Advance
,
positioning
its
location
to
net
as
many
enemies
and
allies
as
possible.
Maokai
's
damage
output
early
game
is
very
high
being
able
to
bring
a
squishy
enemy
to
about
1/3
of
their
health
using
a
few
well
aimed
Sapling
Tosses
.
When
they
get
low
enough
use
the
above
combo,
you
can
easily
get
a
kill.
Maokai
can
have
a
support
role
similar
to
Galio
,
being
able
to
deal
decent
damage
and
still
protect
allies,
or
Malphite
,
being
able
to
disrupt
enemy
positions
and
set-up
kills
for
his
allies
while
still
remaining
relatively
tanky.
Maokai
has
great
jungle
potential
and
is
one
of
the
fastest
clearing
junglers
with
Sapling
Toss
,
Arcane
Smash
and
his
passive
Sap
Magic
.

Orders:
a)
Due
to
Maokai's
reliance
on
mana
in
the
jungle
and
for
a
safer
jungle
path,
begin
at
Blue
buff.
Do

->
Gank(optional,
take

at

->
Wolves

...
If
you
can
get
a
big
leash
at
blue
you
can
save
smite
and
go
straight
for
Red,
in
order
to
perform
a
faster
gank
b)
You
can
also
start
red
in
order
to
perform
a
level
2
gank.
Red
->
Gank
->
Recall
->
Blue
->
Wolves
->
...
In
this
case,
take
Twisted
Advance
at

Build
usage
Maokai
suffers
from
naturally
low
MR
and
benefits
greatly
from
cooldown
reduction
,
so
Spirit
Visage
is
a
perfect
defensive
item
as
it
provides
a
nice
amount
of
both
along
with
synergizing
well
with
Sap
Magic
.
Health
items
synergize
well
with
Sap
Magic
and
improve
his
sustainability.
Shurelya's
Reverie
and
its
active
effect
is
excellent
for
helping
Maokai
getting
into
range
of
good
targets
to
use
Twisted
Advance
on,
or
peeling
allies
as
a
tank
is
wont
to
do,
in
addition
to
having
generally
useful
stats.
The
Philosopher's
Stone
that
is
part
of
the
recipe
also
as
vital:
providing
health
regeneration,
mana
regeneration
and
gold
over
time
-
all
very
useful
for
a
jungler
that
will
be
constantly
getting
damaged
by
monsters,
using
mana
to
kill
them,
and
have
lower
farming
potential
compared
to
laners.
Frozen
Heart
is
an
excellent
item
for
Maokai
,
giving
him
armor
for
survivability,
cooldown
reduction
to
allow
him
to
do
more
damage
and
control
fights
better
with
his
abilities,
mana
to
allow
him
to
maintain
Vengeful
Maelstrom
longer,
and
an
excellent
passive
to
reduce
the
damage
of
enemy
autoattackers.
If
using
a
Guardian
Angel
,
it
is
possible
to
save
your
Sap
Magic
until
after
you
have
resurrected
as
the
stacks
stay
with
you
through
death.
Doing
this
could
save
your
life
if
a
champion
decides
to
wait
around
until
you've
revived.
Maokai
,
much
like
Nautilus
has
rather
high
ability
power
ratios
for
a
tank,
making
tanky
ability
power
items
like
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
,
Ohmwrecker
,
Rod
of
Ages
highly
effective
him,
however,
don't
pick
more
than
two
of
this
as
you
might
leave
your
tankyness
behind.
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
provides
great
synergy
with
Sapling
Toss
,
as
it
applies
the
slow
with
its
first
hit
and
then
again
after
it
chases
down
and
explodes
near
an
opponent.
The
health
will
also
benefit
his
tanking.
Ohmwrecker
can
be
used
to
enable
Maokai
to
tower
dive
more
aggressivly,
and
save
himself
significant
damage
in
situations
where
he
is
dragged
under
tower
by
someone
using
an
escape
during
Twisted
Advance
.
If
your
team
is
already
very
tanky
and
are
in
the
need
of
damage,
you
can
actually
build
ability
power
similar
to
an
actual
mage.
Keep
in
mind
however
that
you
still
have
to
get
very
close
to
an
opponent,
and
as
such
you
should
try
to
remain
hard
to
kill.
Using
a
Sheen
or
Iceborn
Gauntlet
can
offer
great
results
due
to
Maokai's
high
base
attack
damage
and
low
cooldown
on
Arcane
Smash
.
Iceborn
Gauntlet
can
be
aggressive
alternative
to
Frozen
Heart
as
it
provides
almost
the
same
stats.
Chalice
of
Harmony
is
very
useful
on
Maokai
as
it
provides
valuable
MR
and
greatly
increases
his
mana
regeneration
to
extend
the
duration
of
Vengeful
Maelstrom
.
It
can
be
later
upgraded
into
a
Athene's
Unholy
Grail
for
increaced
MR
and
valuable
ability
power,

as

Countering
Part
of
Maokai's
ability
to
tank
comes
from
him
being
able
to
consistently
heal
through
Sap
Magic
.
If
you
can
spare
it,
try
using
Executioner's
Calling
or
another
healing-reduction
ability
to
minimize
its
effect.
When
jungling
,
Maokai
can
reach
level
2
and
gank
earlier
than
most
junglers
due
to
Sapling
Toss
stacking
and
strong
ganking
at
low
levels
with
Twisted
Advance
.
Be
aware
of
this
and
play
accordingly.
Using
Flash
can
pull
a
Maokai
using
Twisted
Advance
into
a
bad
position,
such
as
into
your
turret.
Maokai's
Vengeful
Maelstrom
will
detonate
for
damage
even
if
it
ends
due
to
death
or
mana
loss;
don't
forget
this
when
finishing
him
off
at
low
health.
Avoid
fighting
in
his
Vengeful
Maelstrom
,
as
the
spell
effect
can
turn
the
tide
of
a
teamfight
in
Maokai's
favor.
When
facing
a
laning
Maokai
,
the
most
reliable
way
to
avoid
Sapling
Toss
is
to
stand
near
your
minions,
then
run
when
he
throws
the
sapling.
This
way,
the
minions
draw
aggro
instead
of
you,
allowing
you
to
reliably
get
out
of
the
explosion
radius.
Avoid
the
bushes
if
possible.
Not
only
is
bush-hugging
ineffective
against
Maokai's
Sapling
Toss
,
it
can
actually
make
landing
the
explosion
damage
easier.
