that
bounces
to
nearby
enemies
before
arriving.
Does
not
apply
spell
effects
.
Will
apply
life
steal
and
on-hit
effects
.
Cannot
critically
hit.
Blade
Waltz's
damage
will
function
normally
if
Fiora's
attack
is
dodged
.
Blade
Waltz's
damage
is
not
mitigated
by
block
or
parry
.
Fiora
will
miss
her
attacks
if
she
is
blind
when
she
attacks
an
enemy
champion.
Spell
shields
will
block
one
damage
from
Blade
Waltz.
Additional
Information:
On-hit
effects
damage
are
not
reduced
by
Blade
Waltz
damage
reduction
on
the
same
target.
Fiora
will
reappear
next
to
the
last
enemy
champion
she
attacks.
This
is
normally
her
initial
target
as
the
last
attack
will
always
be
at
the
initial
target
unless
the
target
is
killed
before
she
performs
her
last
attack.
Blade
Waltz
will
prioritize
blinking
to
new
targets
if
within
range
of
addition
enemy
champions
before
blinking
back
to
an
already
struck
target(s).
Blade
Waltz
will
choose
untargetable
and
invisible
targets
if
necessary
to
continue
the
Blade
Waltz,
but
the
ability
will
deal
no
damage.
If
the
target
is
revealed
when
Fiora
jumps
to
them
(in
brush,
fog
of
war
or
Shadow
Walk
),
she'll
deal
damage
as
normal.
When
blinking
next
to
an
enemy
champion,
there
is
a
small
period
of
time
of
when
she
is
targetable.
She
can
take
damage
from
any
source
during
this
time
and
the
turret's
aggro
will
keep
on
re-locking
to
her
if
within
range.
