Demacian
Miners
Saved
in
Kalamanda
Exclusive
mining
contract
awarded
to
Demacia
after
evidence
of
sabotage
uncovered
Auras
Lam
reporting
from
Kalamanda
Village
Evidence
of
Noxian
sabotage
was
discovered
underground
during
the
rescue
operation.
The
twelve
Demacian
miners
trapped
underground
following
a
mine
collapse
last
month
in
Kalamanda
Village
have
been
rescued.
Though
weakened
after
being
buried
underground
for
nearly
a
month,
all
twelve
miners
emerged
in
high
spirits.
The
cave-in
occurred
at
the
#1
Loadstone
Mining
Consortium
on
January
25th,
at
the
site
of
Demacia’s
primary
mineral
extraction
operation
in
Kalamanda.
Rescuers
have
been
working
around
the
clock
to
reach
the
trapped
miners.
During
the
recovery
operation,
Demacia
accepted
help
from
Piltover
and
Ionia
,
and
even
put
aside
its
historical
animosity
to
accept
Noxian
aid.
However,
during
the
excavation,
the
temporary
peace
was
shattered
when
a
troubling
piece
of
evidence
was
discovered,
suggesting
that
the
cause
of
the
mine
collapse
was
man-made.
The
body
of
a
Noxian
soldier
was
recovered
underground
approximately
one
kilometer
east
of
the
trapped
miners,
where
geologists
had
estimated
the
initial
fault
point
of
the
collapse.
The
soldier
was
surrounded
by
various
Noxian
arcano-seismic
charges,
and
he
appeared
to
have
been
caught
unexpectedly
by
the
cave-in
after
the
charges
were
detonated.
An
official
investigation
was
immediately
launched,
with
Kalamanda
and
League
officials
working
in
conjunction
to
scrutinize
this
potentially
cataclysmic
breach
in
the
League
code.
Tensions
at
the
rescue
site
nearly
caused
a
fight
to
break
out,
but
the
Noxian
rescuers
lending
aid
withdrew
swiftly
in
order
to
avoid
conflict.
Although
the
investigation
has
not
reached
an
official
conclusion,
the
Kalamanda
Village
Council
made
the
immediate
ruling
to
grant
Demacia
the
highly
coveted
exclusive
mining
contract.
It
establishes
a
permanent
partnership
between
Kalamanda
and
Demacia,
bestowing
the
city-state
with
exclusive
extraction
rights
of
all
minerals
within
Kalamanda’s
lands.
In
return,
Demacia
commits
mining
resources
and
opens
a
direct
trade
route
to
Kalamanda,
effectively
making
Kalamanda
one
of
its
incontiguous
provinces.
Effective
immediately,
all
independent
and
city-state
affiliated
mining
parties
must
cease
activity
and
withdraw
all
mining
operations
from
the
village’s
boundaries.
A
formal
ceremony
in
the
courtyard
of
Kalamanda’s
Seat
of
the
Elders
will
be
held
in
the
coming
weeks,
with
Mayor
Anson
Ridley
making
the
formal
announcement
of
partnership
with
Demacia.
A
delegation
of
Demacian
officials
will
be
in
attendance,
helmed
by
the
King
of
Demacia
himself,
Jarvan
Lightshield
the
Third.
Bandle
City
Mothership
Dispenses
Fossilized
Cupcake
Yordles
to
hold
parade
in
honor
of
petrified
pastry
Reporting
from
Bandle
City
Yordle
scientists
are
studying
the
fossilized
remains
of
what
has
been
determined
to
be
a
cupcake
recovered
from
the
famed
“Mothership”
of
Bandle
City
.
Beardly
Kittle,
a
local
tinkerer,
made
the
discovery
over
the
weekend
when
he
fell
from
unstable
scaffolding.
“I’m
lucky
I
had
my
safety
line!”
Kittle
said
in
a
press
conference
on
Sunday
afternoon.
“The
walkway
just
fell
away
beneath
me.
I
must’ve
fallen
at
least
fifteen
feet
before
my
line
ended
and
I
crashed
into
the
side
of
the
ship.
When
I
came
to,
there
was
a
loose
panel
with
some
lights
flashing
inside.
I
reached
in
to
see
if
I
could
feel
what
it
was.
Just
then,
I
heard
a
‘ding!’
and
a
stone
fell
into
my
hand!”
Other
witnesses
claimed
to
see
lights
flashing
across
the
ship
for
a
few
seconds
just
after
Kittle
had
fallen
earlier
that
morning.
A
large
crowd
gathered
almost
instantly
after
the
event,
but
it
was
several
hours
before
an
agreement
could
be
reached
on
how
to
get
him
down.
Bandle
City
Mayor
Dennison
Jadefellow
authorized
a
scientific
study
for
both
the
stone
in
Kittle’s
possession
and
the
Mothership
itself.
The
Journal
of
Justice
was
able
to
gain
an
exclusive
analysis
of
the
results.
“The
‘stone’
specimen
is,
in
fact,
a
petrified
cupcake,”
says
lead
scientist
Margie
Grunbean.
“As
you
can
see,
it
has
a
porous
cake
layer
covered
by
a
hardened
shell
of
frosting,
and
a
rock-solid
cherry
attached
at
its
top.
It
certainly
isn’t
edible
now.
I
can
only
guess
what
sorts
of
preservatives
they
must
have
put
in
the
thing
to
make
it
do
this.”
When
asked
about
the
Mothership,
Grunbean
was
less
conclusive:
“I
haven’t
the
faintest
idea
of
how
it
happened.
We
even
tried
stringing
someone
up
there
to
do
the
same
thing
that
Kittle
did.
Poor
Smeed
is
bruised
to
high
heaven
after
bashing
himself
into
the
side
of
it
all
afternoon—and
nothing
happened!
We
are
continuing
to
investigate,
but
so
far
it
doesn’t
look
like
the
Mothership
will
be
turning
on
anytime
soon.”
The
Bandle
City
Mothership,
a
hulking,
unfinished
rocket
ship
that
sits
above
the
city
center,
is
a
cultural
icon
for
Yordles
across
Runeterra
.
There
are
no
records
that
say
where
it
came
from,
but
oral
histories
declare
that
it
was
there
before
the
first
Yordles
came
to
settle
the
Ruddynip
Valley
(where
modern
day
Bandle
City
is
now
located).
Yordle
society
is
unified
around
the
concept
of
“getting
it
ready,”
or
restoring
the
dilapidated
structure
as
a
symbol
of
cooperation.
Unfortunately,
actual
cooperation
ends
with
a
hodgepodge
of
several
unfinished
projects
littering
the
site,
and
ongoing
debate
over
what
should
be
done
next.
The
discovery
has
awakened
unified
celebration
in
Bandle
City
for
the
time
being,
however,
with
Mayor
Jadefellow
declaring
a
city-state
holiday
on
Friday.
Local
civic
groups
are
being
asked
prepare
a
parade
in
honor
of
Kittle
and
his
cupcake.
The
Eye
Inside
The
triumphant
return
of
Ram
Steed
Ram
Steed
your
eye
inside
the
League
of
Legends
My
name
is
Ram
Steed
and
I
am
back
from
the
dead.
As
many
of
you
know,
I
recently
met
the
blade
end
of
Shaco's
Killing
Joke.
Seeking
out
the
elusive
homicidal
jester
at
the
behest
of
the
people,
I
was
brutally
and
repeatedly
stabbed
and
left
for
dead.
The
experience
was
excruciating,
to
say
the
least,
though
I
will
wear
my
scars
with
pride.
However,
as
we
all
know,
the
healing
arts
of
Valoran
are
beyond
most
such
injuries.
Once
found,
clinging
desperately
to
the
last
threads
of
life,
my
wounds
were
quickly
managed
and
my
condition
stabilized.
But
awaken
I
did
not,
for
the
wounds
were
far
more
than
simply
physical.
Shaco's
blades
cut
deeper
than
skin,
deeper
than
muscle
or
bone.
They
carved
into
my
very
soul.
As
a
seeker
of
truth,
as
a
crusader
of
the
people,
I
have
always
driven
myself
to
go
further.
My
life
has
been
one
of
service.
However,
this
was
further
than
I've
ever
gone
–
right
to
the
precipice
of
death
itself.
And
it
was
death
that
began
to
seep
into
my
soul
and
force
me
to
into
a
deep
examination
of
life,
and
not
just
my
life.
Whatever
spark
of
consciousness
remained
in
my
healed
yet
wounded
body
danced
in
realms
beyond
those
of
conventional
reality.
Much
of
my
experience
is
not
one
that
I
can
put
into
words,
not
things
that
I
can
easily
or
readily
share.
Much
of
it
still
seems
like
a
dream
to
me,
unreal
and
ephemeral.
However,
there
are
some
things,
some
conclusions
I
have
made,
that
I
must
share
with
you.
The
thing
I
have
devoted
my
life
to,
the
thing
I
am
most
passionate
about
is
the
truth.
I
am
more
keenly
aware
than
ever
of
just
how
scarce
a
commodity
that
is.
It
is
an
elusive
companion,
cloaked
in
the
shadows
of
politics
and
machinations.
My
experience
has
shown
me
the
extent
to
which
it
is
hidden,
and
it
has
made
me
understand
that
the
quest
for
truth
is
a
dangerous
one
–
far
more
dangerous
than
I
have
believed.
And
I
am
a
man
who
is
now
willing
to
seek
the
truth,
no
matter
the
danger.
I
will
crawl
into
the
mouth
of
Cho'Gath
or
challenge
the
Summoners
who
run
the
Institute
of
War
if
that
is
where
it
lies.
My
dedication
to
you,
the
people,
is
perhaps
stronger
than
it
has
ever
been.
The
people
need
a
champion
to
shed
light
into
the
dark
corners
of
the
world,
not
just
champions
to
fight
its
battles.
I
feel
this
pull
more
strongly
now
than
ever,
as
if
it
were
truly
my
purpose
for
being.
Your
words
of
support
have
moved
me.
It
is
gratifying
to
know
that
one
man
can
matter.
Rest
assured,
the
requests
that
peppered
your
well-wishes
will
not
be
ignored
–
even
if
my
quests
for
truth
take
me
in
other
directions
as
well.
This
is
the
new
Ram
Steed,
signing
off.
Let
the
League
of
Legends
beware.

Senior
Summoner
Ralston
Farnsley
commenting
from
the
Institute
of
War
Our
mailbag
continues
to
swell
with
letters,
growing
greater
with
every
issue.
We’re
very
proud
that
you
have
taken
the
time
to
read
our
publication,
and
we
appreciate
your
thoughts,
suggestions,
well-wishes,
and
questions.
In
these
often-troubling
times,
your
missives
help
remind
us
to
forge
onward,
seeking
and
delivering
the
truth.
"I'm
curious...is
Princess
Sejuani
still
in
hiding?”
–
Skyesilvary
Thank
you
for
asking,
Skyesilvary.
This
is
something
that
has
piqued
the
curiosity
of
many.
In
fact,
Sejuani
has
not
been
seen
in
Freljord
since
the
unification
was
officially
recognized.
Some
sources
have
reported
that
Sejuani
left
the
region,
but
nothing
has
been
confirmed.
We
spoke
with
members
of
the
Winter’s
Claw
tribe,
and
they
admitted
that
they
have
not
had
contact
with
Sejuani
since.
When
asked
if
they
were
worried,
the
tribesmen’s
general
response
was:
“Yes,
but
not
for
her.”
“I
actually
had
a
question
for
Caitlyn
:
Would
she
consider
letting
someone
help
her
catch
'C'?
I
have
a
great
many
contacts
and
people
who
owe
me
favors
in
the
criminal
underworld
and
I
would
be
more
than
willing
to
render
any
and
all
help
if
need
be.”
–
Ymir
Jotun
Who
better
to
address
this
than
Caitlyn
herself?
I
can
tell
you,
however,
that
this
is
a
touchy
subject.
“Ymir,
your
offer
is
well-received,
though
concerning.
Favors
aren’t
often
gained
in
the
criminal
underworld
through
legal
or
responsible
means.
Though
some
law
enforcement
officials
may
endorse
‘playing
ball’,
I
don’t.
I
rely
on
my
wits
and
my
tools
to
get
the
job
done.
That
said,
if
you’ve
got
information
on
'C',
feel
free
to
send
it
over.
If
you’re
asking
to
be
involved
in
my
investigations,
sorry,
I
work
alone.”
“Since
the
victory
of
Ionia
over
Noxus
in
the
League,
I
started
to
seek
information
about
master
Lito's
son,
Zelos.
Zelos
has
left
to
Demacia
long
ago
to
seek
assistance,
and
as
an
Ionian
summoner
and
former
soldier,
I
cannot
help
but
wonder
about
him.
What
is
his
mission's
status,
and
can
Irelia
herself
comment
on
the
last
contact
she
had
with
her
brother?”
–
Summoner
Wasa
of
Ionia
Irelia’s
strength
and
resilience
is
a
symbol
of
the
Ionian
people,
and
it
was
a
truly
heart-wrenching
experience
to
see
the
effect
this
question
had
on
her.
That
she
composed
herself
and
provided
you
with
an
answer
is
a
true
testament
to
her
character.
“I
haven’t
heard
a
word
from
my
brother
nor
any
news
or
rumor
of
him
since
the
day
he
left
for
Demacia.
Soraka
once
told
me
that
if
I
reach
with
my
heart
to
the
stars
every
night,
he
will
know
I’m
here,
and
perhaps
find
a
way
home.
I
haven’t
missed
a
night.”
