The

Legends
refers
to
computer
controlled
opponent
(
AI
-
Artificial
Intelligence)
available
in
custom
games
and
co-op
vs.
AI
matches.
Bots
can
have
either
"beginner"
or
"intermediate"
AI.
On
January
24,
2012
it
was
announced
that
the
bot
system
would
be
expanded
with
more
bots,
better
intelligence
and

on
the
Crystal
Scar
[1]
.
On
February
01,
2012,
the
system
was
released.

Uses
Bots
can
be
used
for:
Practicing
against
or
learning
how
to
play
a
new
Champion;
Filling
in
for
missing
players
to
even
out
teams;
Leisurely
play
for
those
who
do
not
want
to
experience
such
competition
between
summoners;
New
players
who
want
to
familiarize
themselves
with
the
game
(champions,
maps,
items,
item
builds,
champion
skills,
strategies
etc.)
before
competing
with
other
summoners.
Runes
and
Masteries
Intermediate
bots
take
15
mastery
points
and
have
16
runes--five
each
of
Tier
2
Marks/Seals/Glyphs
and
one
Tier
2
Quintessence.
Intermediate
bots
have
no
increased
stats
except
for
a
boost
to
their
passive
gold
gain.
[3]
Beginner
bots
have
neither
runes
nor
masteries.

Adding
Bots
To
add
a
bot
into
a
practice
game,
you
must
first
be
the
creator
or
the
host
of
the
game.
Then,
click
the
"Add
Bot"
button
on
the
right
of
the
empty
slot
to
add
a
bot
to
the
corresponding
team.
Once
a
bot
has
been
added,
you
can
then
change
the
Champion
of
the
bot
by
selecting
it
from
the
drop-down
menu.
Tutorial
Bots
In
the
new
tutorial,
Battle
Training,
four
new
bots
appeared,
with
a
high
AI,
these
are:
Shen
,
who
plays
on
the
player's
team,
and
Annie
,
Malphite
,
and
Nasus
,
who
opposed
the
player.
Cancelled
Bots
During
Sona's
release
in
patch
V1.0.0.101
,
she
was
unintentionally
added
onto
the
bot
roster.
Bots'
names
are
usually
made
up
of
the
champion
name
followed
by
the
word
"Bot"
(e.g.
Annie
Bot).
However,
Sona
went
by
the
name
"game_bot_sona".
She
did
nothing
but
autoattack
and
she
was
removed
from
the
bot
roster
with
V1.0.0.102
.
She
has
been
reintroduced
as
a
standard
bot
with
the
Rise
of
the
Bot
Army
update.
After
the
update,
Nasus
and
Alistar
appear
to
be
scheduled
for
removal
as
bots.
However,
it
is
possible
that
they
will
still
be
able
to
be
selected
in
custom
games,
but
won't
be
available
in
random
player
vs
AI
games.
They,
together
with
Malphite
and
Sivir
,
were
unavailable
in
that
mode
before
the
update.
