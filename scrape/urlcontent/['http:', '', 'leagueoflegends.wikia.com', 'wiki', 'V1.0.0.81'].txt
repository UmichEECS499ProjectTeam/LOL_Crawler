Shen
The
Eye
of
Twilight
Vorpal
Blade
:
Hits
a
target
enemy
for
magic
damage,
and
marks
the
target
for
allies
to
see.
Allied

that
attack
the
marked
enemy
target
get
healed
over
several
seconds.
Feint

defends
against
the
next
champion
attack
or
spell,
blocking
much
of
the
damage
from
it.
Shadow
Dash
:
Shen
dashes
towards
target
location,
taunting
enemies
he
passes
through.
Stand
United
(Ultimate):
Shen
places
a
shield
on
himself
and
on
a
target
ally
which
absorbs
damage.
After
channeling
for
several
seconds,
Shen
teleports
to
the
target
ally.
Ki
Strike
(Innate):
Every
8
seconds,
Shen’s
next
attack
deals
bonus
damage
based
on
his
max
health.
Being

by
enemy
champions
makes
this
passive
occur
more
frequently.

Fires
3
rockets
at

nearest
enemy
minions
or
champions,

Ability
power
ratio
reduced
to
0.55
from
0.8
to
accomodate
the
significant
cooldown
reduction.
Base
damage
reduced
to
85/135/185/235/285
from
90/150/210/270/330.
UPGRADE!!!

Retains
the
10/15/20%
cooldown
reduction
passive.

all
existing
evolution
turrets
are
healed
for
100%
of
their

addition,
all
existing

20/25/30%
movement
slowing

Particle
and
Network
Improvements
We've
made
networking
optimizations
in
order
to
reduce
the
lag
and
latency
for
some
players.
In
addition,
the
particle
system
has
been
improved
to
provide
better
performance
for
some
machines
in
areas
that
have
a
high
density
of
particles.
This
is
most
noticeable
near
the
top
of
Twisted
Treeline
,
but
general
performance
should
also
improve.
