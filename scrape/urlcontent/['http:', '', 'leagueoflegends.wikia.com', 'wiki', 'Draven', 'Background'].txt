Draven,

Executioner

Champion
Unlike
his
brother
Darius
,
victory
in
battle
was
never
enough
for
Draven.
He
craved
recognition,
acclaim,
and
glory.
He
first
sought
greatness
in
the
Noxian
military,
but
his
flair
for
the
dramatic
went
severely
underappreciated.
Thirsting
for
a
method
to
share
"Draven"
with
the
world,
he
turned
his
attention
to
the
prison
system.
There
he
carved
out
the
celebrity
he
desired
by
turning
the
tedious
affair
of
executions
into
a
premiere
spectacle.
At
Draven's
first
execution,
he
shocked
onlookers
when
he
ordered
the
doomed
prisoner
to
run
for
dear
life.
Just
before
the
man
managed
to
flee
from
sight,
Draven
brought
him
down
with
a
flawless
throw
of
his
axe.
Soon,
all
Draven's
executions
became
a
gauntlet
through
which
Noxian
prisoners
raced
for
a
final
chance
at
life.
He
used
this
trial
as
his
own
personal
stage,
and
turned
executions
into
a
leading
form
of
entertainment.
He
rallied
onlookers
into
a
frenzy,
while
desperate
prisoners
scrambled
to
evade
him.
They
never
succeeded.
Rejecting
the
solemn,
black
uniforms
of
Noxian
executioners,
Draven
donned
bright
outfits
and
developed
flashy
signature
moves
to
distinguish
himself.
Crowds
flocked
to
see
Draven
in
action,
and
tales
of
his
performances
spread
quickly.
As
his
popularity
grew,
so
did
his
already-inflated
ego.
He
belonged
at
the
center
of
attention.
Before
long,
the
scope
of
his
ambitions
outgrew
the
population
of
Noxus.
He
decided
that
the
glorious
exploits
of
Draven
should
be
put
on
display
for
the
entire
world
.
"The
'best'
is
wherever
I
decide
to
set
the
bar
each
day."

Sneak

Announcement

NeeksNaman
:
[2]
Draven
Sneak
Peek
There's
a
saying
in
the
entertainment
business:
"The
show
must
go
on!"
When
your
particular
niche
in
the
world
of
show
business
is
brutal,
gladiatorial
combat,
however,
this
expression
comes
with
its
own
set
of
limitations.
Take
Darius'
brother
Draven,
the
Glorious
Executioner.
While
he
might
be
the
consummate
entertainer,
this
vicious
champion
of
the
arena
is
most
famous
for
knowing
exactly
how
it
is
that
the
proverbial
show
comes
to
an
end
–
usually
in
some
grandiose,
blood-soaked
fashion.
So
if
you're
interested
in
taking
a
few
lessons
from
a
headliner
that
cuts
against
the
grain,
you'll
definitely
be
excited
to
welcome
Draven
to
the
League
of
Legends
this
patch.

Draven
is
poised
to
enter
the
League
this
coming
patch.
This
champion
of
the
arena
knows
the
value
of
enjoying
what
you
do
–
even
if
your
line
of
work
happens
to
involve
grisly
executions!
For
a
ranged
attack
damage
champion
like
Draven,
proper
positioning
is
extremely
important
for
maximizing
your
damage
potential
while
remaining
safe.
For
Draven,
however,
good
positioning
will
also
allow
you
to
utilize
your
primary
ability,
Spinning
Axe,
to
its
fullest
potential.
Upon
activation,
Draven's
next
basic
attack
will
deal
bonus
damage
and
cause
his
signature
throwing
axe
to
bounce
high
into
the
air.
Catching
the
axe
will
refresh
the
effect,
causing
Draven's
next
basic
attack
to
also
become
a
Spinning
Axe.
After
a
couple
of
catches,
Draven
can
even
activate
the
ability
a
second
time
to
utilize
two
Spinning
Axes
at
once!.
Since
positioning
is
so
important
for
this
flashy
ranged
carry,
we've
also
equipped
Draven
with
some
additional
skills
to
keep
him
on
the
offensive.
Activating
Blood
Rush
will
give
you
just
the
boost
of
speed
that
you
need
to
get
out
of
trouble,
keep
up
the
chase
or
rapidly
reposition
to
catch
a
falling
throwing
axe.
As
an
added
bonus
each
time
you
make
a
successful
catch,
the
cooldown
for
Blood
Rush
is
refreshed,
allowing
you
to
activate
it
again
to
maintain
momentum.
Additionally,
the
slow
and
knockback
from
Stand
Aside
can
help
you
chase
down
a
fleeing
enemy
so
you
can
continue
the
onslaught.
If
you
really
want
to
showcase
your
trick
shot
skills,
Draven's
ultimate,
Whirling
Death,
is
sure
to
make
the
crowd
go
wild.
Upon
activation,
Draven
will
roll
out
both
his
hand
axes
in
a
global
line
attack,
dealing
damage
to
each
enemy
in
their
path.
By
reactivating
Whirling
Death
you
can
recall
your
hand
axes
to
your
current
location,
bringing
Whirling
Death
back
around
for
another
pass
through
the
enemy
team.
Repositioning
yourself
with
Blood
Rush
and
knocking
enemy
opponents
back
into
the
line
of
fire
with
Stand
Aside
can
turn
this
second
run
into
a
truly
impressive
and
devastating
spectacle
of
death!

deal
bonus
physical
damage.
This
axe
will
ricochet
off

up
into
the
air.
If

catches
it,
he
automatically
readies
another
Spinning
Axe.
Draven
can
have
two
Spinning
Axes
at
once.

and
slowing
his
targets.

(Ultimate)
Draven
hurls
two
massive
axes
dealing
physical
damage
to
each
unit
struck.
Whirling
Death
slowly
reverses
direction
and
returns
to
Draven
after
striking
an
enemy
champion.

ability
while
the
axes
are
in

to
cause
them
to
return
early.

reverse
direction.
