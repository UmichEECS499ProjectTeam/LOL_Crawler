Skill
usage
Taric
's
passive
Gemcraft
allows
him
to
reduce
the
cooldown
of
his
abilities
by
two
seconds
every
time
he
attacks
after
using
a
spell
as
well
as
deal
additional
bonus
damage.
Try
to
weave
in
an
autoattack
after
every
spell
in
order
to
keep
spamming
your
abilities
quickly
in
succession
and
maximize
damage.
If
Taric
targets
himself
with
his
heal,
he'll
be
healed
for
140%.
Less
selfishly,
healing
an
ally
will
still
heal
Taric
for
100%
of
the
amount,
effectively
healing
for
200%.
You
can
use
the
active
of
Shatter
when
attempting
to
play
an
aggressive
early
game
or
to
last
hit
multiple
minions
at
once.
Shatter
is
also
very
useful
in
team
fights.
Use
the
area
of
effect
on
the
squishy
enemies
so
your
AD
carry
can
kill
them
faster
due
to
the
armor
reduction
.
Using
the
active
on
Shatter
will
remove
the
passive
bonus
armor
it
provides
(but
you
retain
the
passive
armor
aura).
Make
sure
not
to
use
it
when
being
ganked
or
chased,
as
the
loss
of
armor
will
make
you
easier
to
kill.
Taric
can
clear
minion
waves
really
fast
with
his
Shatter
and
Radiance
abilities.
Building
ability
power
early
game
and
maxing
out
Dazzle
can
lead
to
extremely
high
single-spell
burst
and
harass
at
level
9.
However,
this
strategy
has
its
drawbacks,
as
the
damage
from
Dazzle
will
not
be
substantial
late
game
and
requires
Taric
to
be
at
very
close
range
in
order
to
deal
the
full
damage.
Taric
should
usually
Dazzle
the
enemy
carry
in
a
team
fight
so
that
they
can
be
quickly
killed
by
your
team.
Taric's
Dazzle
is
difficult
to
see,
however,
so
if
there
is
more
than
one
potential
target,
it's
up
to
you
to
determine
which
enemy
to
stun,
usually
by
pinging
them.
When
coupled
with
Singed's
Fling
or
another
repositioning
ability,
this
can
provide
a
clear
advantage
in
a
team
fight.
Use
Radiance
during
pushes
or
team
fights
to
boost
the
damage
of
your
teammates,
but
be
careful
not
to
activate
it
too
early,
as
it
is
highly
visible,
so
enemy
champions
may
disengage
and
wait
out
the
10
seconds.
Pairing
Taric
and
another
pushing
hero
such
as
Sivir
together
can
make
a
very
effective
pushing
duo.
Due
to
his
slow
movement
speed
and
lack
of
any
real
escape/chase
mechanisms
(
Dazzle
has
a
long
cooldown
and
can
be
negated
by
such
things
as
Banshee's
Veil
,
Black
Shield
or
Spell
Shield
,
Cleanse
,
etc.),
Ghost
and
Flash
are
both
respectable
choices
for
Taric's
summoner
spells.
Early
game,
Taric
is
relatively
squishy.
Stay
clear
of
the
enemy
until
you
have
taken
Shatter
and/or
purchased
survivability
items.
Dazzle
used
before
or
after
another
guaranteed
stun/knockup
will
maximize
the
CC
duration,
allowing
for
a
potential
kill.
Taric
is
a
great
roamer
with
his
stun
Dazzle
allowing
his
team
to
set
up
ganks
and
stun-locking
a
target
if
your
ally
has
a
stun.
Taric
can
zone
very
well
with
his
Dazzle
and
by
letting
his
lane
partner
farm
while
zoning
the
enemy
off
by
sitting
in
the
bushes
at
bottom
lane.
Build
usage
A
popular
way
to
itemize
Taric
is
to
stack
auras
,
such
as
Aegis
of
the
Legion
,
Locket
of
the
Iron
Solari
,
or
Zeke's
Herald
to
synergize
with
his
ability
auras
from
Shatter
and
Radiance
.
Itemizing
Taric
with
Mercury's
Treads
provides
many
buffs
to
his
natural
deficiencies.
As
Taric's
base
armor
is
already
high
thanks
to
his
Shatter
,
Mercury's
Treads
is
a
good
item
to
grab
on
him
since
his
necessity
to
get
close
to
use
two
of
his
abilities
will
often
be
the
focus
target
in
team
fights.
The
magic
resistance
also
helps
him
as
his
magic
resistance
is
only
average.
When
playing
as
support,
is
useful
to
take
both
Frost
Queen's
Claim
and
Mikael's
Crucible
,
the
first
for
getting
gold
and
mana
regen
aura,
and
also
a
powerful
slow
that
combine
quite
well
with
initiating
a
team
fight,
the
latter
for
increased
mana
regen
and
magic
resist,
and
his
powerful
active
that
is
an
equivalent
Cleanse
and
Heal
.
These
two
items
are
very
useful
to
all
support
champions,
but
for
Taric
they
offer
a
bit
more,
due
to
his
skillset
(a
stun,
a
heal
and
an
aura
armor)
Cooldown
reduction
items
are
very
useful
for
Taric
,
because
your
Radiance
is
one
of
the
most
useful
auras
for
your
team,
granting
a
strong
AD
/
AP
bonus
to
your
entire
team
on
a
relatively
short
cooldown.
It
is
possible
to
build
Taric
as
an
AP
caster/burst
mage.
He
has
strong
AoE
damage
from
Shatter
and
that
can
follow
up
a
Dazzle
stun.
Build
mana
regeneration
and
cooldown
reduction
to
constantly
use
all
of
his
abilities.
Although
expensive,
both
Frozen
Heart
and
Iceborn
Gauntlet
are
very
useful
on
Taric
&
to
his
team.
They
synergize
well
with
his
Shatter
Gemcraft
.
If
the
enemy
team
is
AD
heavy,
or
the
majority
of
their
damage
turns
out
to
be
physical
at
mid
game
(check
who
gets
fed
in
the
scoreboard),
consider
getting
a
Thornmail
instead
of
a
Aegis
of
the
Legion
or
Locket
of
the
Iron
Solari
.
It
will
be
more
efficient
at
providing
armor
(100
vs
30
vs
30)
for
basically
the
same
cost
as
Aegis,
and
Taric's
Shatter
will
provide
more
armor
than
either
Aegis
or
Runic
when
Taric
has
250
total
armor
(30/.12
=
250).
Taric's
lvl
18
armor
is
74,
and
combined
with
100
bonus
armor
and
30
passive
armor
bonus,
means
that
Taric
only
needs
44
armor
from
other
sources.
Usually
flat
armor
seals
and
Ninja
Tabi
handle
this
job
quite
well.
If
the
enemy
team
is
AP
heavy,
or
the
majority
of
their
damage
turns
out
to
be
magical
at
mid
game
(check
who
gets
fed
in
the
scoreboard),
consider
getting
a
Spirit
Visage
,
because
they
increase
your
self-healing
of
Imbue
(120%
to
168%
respectively)
and
reduces
the
cooldowns
of
all
abilities
by
10%.
However,
this
item
is
still
a
good
choice,
regardless
of
the
enemy
team.
Taric
can
also
go
solo
top
lane
as
an
AP/AD
bruiser,
focusing
on
building
large
amounts
of
armor,
magic
resistance,
mana,
and
health.
This
can
be
an
effective
couter
pick
to
AD
based
bruisers
and
assassins
such
as
Riven
,
Zed
,
and
Olaf
to
a
degree.
If
going
solo
top
items
such
as
Iceborn
Gauntlet
,
Frozen
Heart
,
and
Manamune
/
Archangel's
Staff
are
all
good
items
for
dueling
against
melee
bruisers
or
assassins,
while
Spirit
Visage
is
good
for
mitigating
magic
damage
and
improving
your
self
heal.
Jungling
Aside
from
his
classic
role
as
a
support,
Taric
is
also
a
jungler.
He
is
not
very
popular
as
a
jungler
and
it
may
take
your
enemies(and
allies)
off-guard.
Imbue
lets
him
keep
his
health
high.
Taric
can
cast
this
skill
often
as
basic
attacks
reduce
its
cooldown..
Shatter
aura
is
useful
for
beginner
junglers
and
people
lacking
jungle
runes
and
its
active
speeds
up
his
clear
time.
Dazzle
is
a
great
initiation
for
ganking
followed
by
Radiance
and
Shatter
.
At
later
ranks
with
some
CDR
its
cooldown
is
short
enough
to
be
used
a
second
time
during
a
single
gank.

Countering
Be
careful
not
to
over-commit
to
early
lane
fights
with
Taric
,
considering
he
is
one
of
the
few
champions
able
to
heal
himself
and
stun
the
opponent.
Taric
has
little
resistance
to
long
ranged
harassment.
Taric
is
naturally
strong
against
physical
damage
due
to
his
passive
Shatter
armor
bonus,
but
has
no
magic
damage
protection.
Use
this
as
an
advantage
when
possible.
Taric's
survivability
with
tanky
items
is
incredible
and
he
can
usually
absorb
damage
over
extended
periods
of
time
from
multiple
champions
in
order
to
bait
you
into
overextending
or
pursuing
him
into
the
jungle.
Don't
engage
him
without
information
on
his
allies'
positions.
When
playing
as
a
melee
carry,
targeting
Taric
can
usually
result
in
your
death
if
you
run
into
the
middle
of
his
team
or
chase
him
through
the
jungle
to
kill
him,
as
his
armor
aura
and
his
innate
ability
to
heal
himself
greatly
makes
him
a
difficult
1v1
kill.
Also,
when
fighting
him
1v1,
consider
that
his
abilities
reduce
the
cooldown
on
his
other
abilities.
It
is
possible
for
Taric
to
1v1
indefinitely
as
long
as
he
can
outheal
your
damage
(usually
due
to
having
high
resistances)
and
that
he
has
mana
to
sustain
his
abilities.
Cooldown
reduction
almost
isn't
necessary
due
to
his
new
passive.
