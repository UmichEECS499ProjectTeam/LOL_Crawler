Custom
Games
are
games
for
10%
reduced
experience
which
allow
you
to
play
against
and/or
alongside
players
and/or
bots.

Notes
Leaving
a
custom
game
will
not
count
towards
your
game's
left
counter.
Custom
games
do
not
count
towards
champion
kill
/
death
/
assist
ratings.
Just
because
it
is
a
custom
game
does
not
exclude
players
from
the
summoners
code.
No
EXP/IP
is
rewarded
If
the
number
of
players
on
each
team
is
not
equal.
No
EXP/IP
is
rewarded
if
the
number
of
human
players
is
less
than
half
the
maximum
players
for
the
map.
(Need
3
players
on
Twisted
Treeline,
5
players
on
Howling
Abyss
or
Summoner's
Rift)
If
you
are
summoner
level
15
or
higher,
you
may
earn
EXP/IP
from
up
to
120
minutes
per
a
day
in
custom
games.
Additional
game
time
rewards
no
EXP
or
IP.
(This
timer
is
shared
with
co-op
vs.
AI
games
as
well)
Custom
games
do
not
award
matchmade
IP,
and
from
summoner
level
15
upwards,
award
25%
less
game
time
IP
than
do
normal
games
on
the
same
map.
If
all
the
real
players
in
a
custom
game
quit,
the
custom
game
ends
and
players
can
no
longer
reconnect.
However,
neither
IP
nor
EXP
is
rewarded
to
the
players.
On
certain
days,
when
there
is
high
traffic
on
the
server,
custom
games
would
require
at
least
2
real
players
to
start
the
game.
This
is
done
to
lessen
the
burden
on
the
system
hosting
multiple
single
player
games.
(Since
the
start
of
Season
One
the
minimum
number
of
player
required
can
get
up
to
10,
if
the
server
is
too
overloaded
with
matches)
Bot
Order
and
Laning
in
Custom
Games
Contrary
to
popular
belief,
it
is
possible
to
control
which
bot
goes
to
which
lane
during
the
custom
game
set-up
process.
When
adding
bots
to
your
custom
game,
disregarding
any
humans
players
on
either
team,
the
bots
will
go
to
a
lane
as
follows:
1st
and
4th
bots
go
bottom,
2nd
and
5th
bots
go
top,
and
3rd
bot
goes
mid.
The
bots
will,
however,
consider
where
players
have
gone
once
minions
spawn
and
they
will
fill
in
the
appropriate
lanes
based
on
that.
Custom
Game
Types
Custom
games
are
created
by
the
playerbase,
each
with
their
own
set
of
rules.
Because
they
are
unofficial
variations
of
the
game,
following
the

is
purely
honor
based.

Hardcore
PVP
This
mode
is
rumored
to
be
(as
the
title
states)
a
hardcore
PVP
situation,
in
which
you
farm
no
minions
or
Jungle
mobs,
but
instead
fight
to
the
death.
Protect
the
Soraka
Bot
Game
variant
where
all
normal
game
rules
apply,
but
the
goal
of
the
game
is
to
kill,
(in
any
way),
the
enemy
Soraka
Bot
until
she
has
died
10
times.
No
spells
or
items
are
prohibited,
everything
is
fair
game
in
this
game
variant.
This
game
type
is
also
known
as
"Protect
the
Queen."
Catch
the
Teemo
This
game
mode
has
a
time
limit
of
10
minutes
in
which
the
attacking
team
(the
team
without
the
Teemo)
must
kill
the
Teemo
2
times
while
the
Defending
(the
team
with
the
Teemo)
must
protect
him
for
10
minutes.
While
the
Teemo
cannot
leave
the
jungle,
must
keep
moving
to
stop
his
passive
from
activating,
cannot
run
through
mid
lane,
cannot
run
in
between
the
towers,
and
cannot
run
back
or
recall,
everyone
else
can.
To
Catch
The
Teemo
Catch
the
Yeti
Limit
of
10
kills
against
the
enemy's
Nunu
.
The
objective
of
"Catch
the
Yeti"
is
to
kill
the
other
team's
Nunu
while
also
defending
your
own
Nunu.
The
first
team
to
kill
the
opposing
Nunu
10
times
(or
5
for
a
much
shorter
game)
wins.
There
is
no
experience
gained
from
minions,
including
jungle
creeps.
This
means
that
Nunu
is
unable
to
use
his
Consume,
and
is
therefore
very
limited
in
terms
of
abilities.
Nunu
cannot
return
to
base
without
giving
the
enemy
a
point.(In
short
it's
the
same
rules
as
catch
the
teemo)
LoL
Football
This
game
takes
place
on
The
Proving
Grounds
,
in
Draft
Mode
.
There
are
4
players
on
each
side.
The
attacking
team
must
get
killed
by
the
Nexus
Obelisk
without
it
counting
as
a
kill
for
the
defending
team.
The
score
is
calculated
by
taking
the
total
deaths
for
the
attacking
team
minus
the
kills
for
the
defending
team.
The
half
ends
when
the
defending
team
destroys
the
attacking
team's
Nexus
.
You
then
switch
sides
in
the
next
game.
Whoever
has
the
most
points
wins.
Ultimates
that
can
teleport
across
the
map
are
prohibited,
along
with
Teleport
.
Sunfire
Cape
is
banned.
Find
the
Teemo
This
game
variation
is
either
played
on
Dominion
or
Summoner's
Rift
.
In
contrast
to
Catch
The
Teemo
,
in
this
game
mode
the
Teemo
's
on
each
team
have
a
preset
time
to
hide
anywhere
on
the
map
and
let
their
Innates
activate.
As
soon
as
both
Teemos
are
invisible,
both
teams
have
to
find
and
kill
the
enemy
Teemo
before
the
enemy
team
does.

This

Please
be
patient
as
the
person
who
started
this
article
or
a
recent
editor
is
probably
still
in
the
process
of
committing
changes
to
it.
Unlike
a
stub
,
contributors
have
the
intention
of
filling
out
this
article
soon.
This
game
variation
is
usually
played
on
Dominion
,
but
can
also
be
played
on
Summoner's
Rift
.
Draft
Mode
is
highly
recommended,
although
Blind
Pick
and
Random
Pick
are
both
possible.
The
Time
Limit
can
be
40
or
45
minutes.
The
blue
team
consists
of
5
hiders,
and
the
purple
team
has
2
seekers.
When
the
game
begins,
the
hiders
will
have
until
2
minutes
on
the
game
clock
to
move
to
any
spot
on
the
map
before
the
seekers
may
exit
their
base
and
look
for
them.
Hiders
may
use
only
CC
moves
to
help
them
or
another
hider
escape.
Heals,
shields,
and
certain
other
moves
are
allowed.
Each
hider
has
five
lives.
When
a
hider
dies,
they
lose
a
life.
When
a
hider
loses
all
their
lives,
they
are
OUT
and
may
not
participate
in
the
game
any
longer.
They
may,
however,
run
around
the
outside
of
the
Dominion
map.
Once
a
hider
has
respawned,
they
are
allowed
a
30-second
grace
period
in
which
they
can
enter
the
map
without
hindrance
from
the
seekers.
Hiders
may
NOT
recall,
stay
at
base,
or
walk
back
to
base
at
any
time.
Standing
at
the
entrance
of
the
base,
however,
is
allowed.
Items
are
limited
to
non-slowing
items
and
no
Guardian
Angel.

Ultimate
Bravery
is
a
custom
game
mode
at
League
of
Legends
that
is
played
by
following
a
random
build
of
masteries,
summoner
spells,
items,
non-ult
skills
to
max
first
and
a
champion.
Any
player
should
follow
his
random
build
because
he/she
should.

Rules
Love
Champion,
you
will:
Once
you
have
your
choice
of
champions
and
you
press
the
button
to
start
your
Ultimate
Bravery,
you
can
not
go
back
!You
have
to
choose
the
champion
displayed
on
your
screen,
even
if
an
atomic
bomb
would
explode
near
you.
Activate
your
summoner
spells
,
you
will:
Even
if
you
fall
on
Rally
/
Resurrect,
it
is
your
duty
to
make
good
use
throughout
the
game.
In
addition,
it
is
a
favor
you
did
the
God
of
Courage
:
the
more
your
summoners
are
bad,
the
more
victory
will
be
rewarding.
Max
your
main
spell
,
you
will:
If
you
want
to
prove
that
you
got
balls
(or
ovaries
for
girls),
you
should
put
your
skill
points
in
priority
in
the
spell
that
you
have
been
assigned
(Q,W
or
E).
Dishonor
on
your
whole
progeny
if
by
chance
you
took
the
desire
to
choose
another
spell
while
your
selection
is
available
!
Build
in
the
right
order,
you
will:
Having
boots
in
the
early
game,
it
roxx
!
Doransare
for
weaklings.
You,
you
must
run
fast
to
rush
into
the
crowd
!
Being
first
in
line:
this
is
your
goal.
Then
you
must
purchase
the
items
in
the
order
listed,
always
starting
from
the
leftmost.
If
you
have
a
stack
item
to
last,
so
much
the
better:
you
will
not
surrender
to
20
minutes
either
!
Forget
wards,
you
will:
What
is
the
advantage
of
seeing
the
enemy
arrive
?
I
imagine
that
at
night,
you
do
not
turn
on
the
light
in
your
home
to
see
the
obstacles
...
Then
do
the
same
on
the
field
of
the
League
!
If
ever
a
doubt
you
took
on
the
bush
that
you
are
about
to
cross,
well
go
for
it,
you'll
be
set
!
Prove
your
choices,
you
will:
Since
a
courageous
person
does
not
trust
anyone,
you
must
copy
/
paste
your
"Bravery"
at
the
beginning
of
each
game.
So,
your
teammates
will
verify
that
no
weakness
goes
through
your
head.
Alternative

if
