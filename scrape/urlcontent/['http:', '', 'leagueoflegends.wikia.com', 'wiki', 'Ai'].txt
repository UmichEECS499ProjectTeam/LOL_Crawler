Co-op
vs.
AI
is
a
game
mode
in
League
of
Legends
where
a
team
of
players
are
matched
against
a
team
of
computer-controlled
champions
commonly
known
as
bots
.
The
team
sizes
are
the
same
as
in
normal
player
versus
player
matches,
but
the
variety
of
game
modes
has
been
reduced.

Description
Co-op
is
available
on
The
Crystal
Scar
(
Dominion
mode)
,
Twisted
Treeline
,
or
Summoner's
Rift
(
classic
mode
).
There
are
two
difficulties
to
pick
from,
Beginner
and
Intermediate.
A
player
can
either
play
alone
or
invite
their
friends
to
join
them.
If
the
composed
team
has
less
than
5
players,
the
matchmaker
searches
for
other
players
wanting
to
play
at
the
selected
difficulty.
The
co-op
matchmaker
works
similar
to
normal
games
,
but
considers
the
players
level
instead
of
their
Elo
Rating
.
First
Win
of
the
Day
IP
bonus
is
available
and
Elo
Ratings
are
not
affected.
Co-op
vs.
AI
rewards
are
slightly
higher
than
custom
games
but
lower
than
normal
games
or
ranked
games
.
Here
are
the
current
rules
for
Co-op
vs
AI
rewards:
All
summoners
can
earn
unlimited
rewards
per
day
in
Co-op
vs.
AI.
However,
level
15+
summoners
can
only
earn
75%
of
the
normal
Co-op
vs
AI
rewards
after
180
minutes.
The
following
modifiers
are
applied
based
on
summoner
level
and
bot
difficulty
setting.
These
percentages
represent
how
much
of
the
standard
reward
is
received:
Summoner
level
Difficulty
Beginner
Intermediate
1-9
100%
100%
10-19
85%
100%
20-29
70%
90%
30
55%
80%
There
is
a
pool
of
56
champions
that
the
bots
can
be
picked
from.
They
are
as
follows,
listed
within
categories
according
to
five
major
roles

Fighter

Bot
behavior
Bots
have
different
behavior
and
advantages
depending
on
the
difficulty
selected.
Some
behavior
is
standard,
regardless
of
difficulty
selected.
Most
notably
the
bots
will
not
jungle
or
pursue
creep
buffs,
though
the
bots
on
the
Crystal
Scar
and
Twisted
Treeline
maps
will
actively
acquire
altar
and
pad
buffs
located
around
the
maps.
The
other
universal
behavior
is
a
faster
revive
time
if
killed.
Bots
will
occasionally
chat
at
the
beginning
and
end
of
games.
Beginner
The
bot
pool
has
less
variation,
as
the
game
draws
upon
a
smaller
selection
of
champions.
The
bots
use
less
advanced
tactics
and
do
not
gank
as
effectively.
Bots
do
not
receive
any
rune
or
mastery
bonuses,
or
some
type
of
equivalent.
Bots
do
not
use
any
summoner
spells,
despite
equipping
themselves
with
2.
Intermediate
Bots
do
not
need
line
of
sight
to
target
their
abilities.
For
instance,
if
a
bot
or
nearby
enemy
minion
sees
you
enter
the
bushes
then
the
enemy
bots
are
able
to
directly
target
you
in
that
bush
for
several
seconds
(as
if
it
was
warded).
This
differs
from
human
opponents
who
would
need
to
face
check
the
bush
(if
not
warded)
to
use
direct
target
abilities.
The
bots
will
use
more
advanced
tactics.
This
includes
switching
champions
around
in
lanes,
trying
to
gank
often,
or
more
rarely
trying
to
push
a
lane
with
three
champions
within
the
first
ten
minutes.
The
bots
will
still
gain
items
even
if
they
were
gold
starved
in
a
lane.
This
suggests
that
they
gain
items
based
on
level
or
have
increased
gold
over
time.
Bots
don't
have
runes
or
masteries.
Bots
will
use
alternate
champion
skins,
which
may
cause
confusion.
Bots
will
actively
use
summoner
spells.
History
Co-op
vs.
AI
was
first
announced
on
LeagueofLegends.com
on
January
20th,
2011,
as
a
new
game
mode
intended
to
prove
a
harder
challenge
and
training
method
for
players
rather
than
just
the
bots
available
through
the
custom
game
option.
A
match
showing
a
fight
between
some
of
the
new
bots
versus
mid-level
Riot
Employees
was
announced
on
February
4th
to
take
place
on
February
9th.
This
battle
was
streamed
through
Own3d,
and
resulted
on
a
close
(and
sketchy)
victory
for
the
Bots.
It
was
intended
to
be
released
on
the
week
following
the
V1.0.0.111
Patch,
but
it
was
delayed
because
the
European
servers
were
not
ready
to
take
on
the
increased
stress
that
would
be
caused
by
the
game
mode.
It
was
finally
released
on
a
Thursday,
on
March
10.
It
supported
two
difficulty
settings,
Beginner
and
Intermediate,
and
a
pool
of
12
bots
available
only
on
Summoner's
Rift
.
Rise
of
the
Bots
Update
On
January
24,
2012,
Riot
released
a
news
post
announcing
an
update
to
the
Co-op
vs.
AI
game
mode.
This
update
was
put
in
place
on
February
1,
2012,
with
the
V1.0.0.133
patch.
The
new
features
and
upgrades
included
the
following:
Bots
made
available
in
the
Dominion
game
mode,
which
its
co-op
option
was
unavailable
at
the
initial
launch
until
this
patch.
More
intelligent
bots
with
increased
map
awareness,
capability
to
use
skillshots
as
well
as
more
summoner
spells
and
active
items.
The
flat
IP
penalty
for
Co-op
versus
AI
games
was
removed.
The
rewards
were
also
changed
to
make
the
mode
more
attractive.
Increased
the
roster
of
bots
from
12
to
40.
Also,
more
champions
are
being
added
in
the
subsequent
patches
regularly.
