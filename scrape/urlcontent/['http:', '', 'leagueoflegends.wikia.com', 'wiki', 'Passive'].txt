A
passive
effect
is
an
effect
which
applies
as
a
part
of
a
larger
action,
or
automatically
throughout
the
game.
They
are
added
bonuses,
some
of
which
directly
increase
base
stats
,
while
others
require
a
form
of
action
such
as
activation.
Acquisition
There
are
currently
three
different
ways
to
acquire
passive
effects
in
the
game.
The
first
ones
are
champion
abilities
,
every
innate
ability
has
a
passive
effect
but
some
champions
have
an
additional
ability
which
grants
a
boost
passively,
like
Ashe's
Hawkshot
and
Xin
Zhao's
Battle
Cry
.
The
second
ones
are
items
,
when
purchased
these
items
will
grant
the
wearer
increased
stats
and
effects
as
long
as
it
is
not
sold
or
built
into
another
items
as
part
of
a
recipe.
However
these
passive
effects
are
usually
persistent
throughout
the
building
chain.
For
example
Zeal
.
The
third
one
is
the
global
effect
in
the
Crystal
Scar
map
in
the
Dominion
game-type
and
Proving
Grounds
map
in
ARAM
game-type.
This
passive
effect
applies
to
all
players
from
the
start
to
the
end
of
the
game.
Types
There
are
several
different
types
of
passive
effects,
aside
from
the
usual
defensive,
offensive
or
utility.
These
mainly
are:
Constant
passives
,
these
effects
are
persistent
throughout
the
game
no
matter
what
action
is
taken.
They
include
innate
abilities
,
and
both
Crystal
Scar
and
Proving
Grounds
passive
bonuses.
Restrained
passives
,
these
are
in
effect
until
a
certain
action
is
taken
that
temporarily
disables
them.
For
example
Wuju
Style
and
Raise
Morale
.
Stacking
passives
,
these
passives
have
an
effect
which
increases
each
time
a
certain
action
is
performed.
For
example
Jax's
Relentless
Assault
,
Kayle's
Holy
Fervor
,
and
Guinsoo's
Rageblade
.
Global
passives
,
these
passives
have
an
effect
on
every
member
of
the
team
and
are
restricted
to
only
a
handful
of
champions.
For
example
Zilean's
Heightened
Learning
.
Aura
passives
,
these
passives
have
a
small
area
of
effect
that
affect
allies
and
or
foes.
For
example
Fiddlesticks's
Dread
and
Soraka's
Consecration
.
Buffing
passives
,
these
passives
increase
stats
such
as
attack
damage
from
Zeke's
Herald
and
ability
power
from
Will
of
the
Ancients
.
De-buffing
passives
,
these
passives
decrease
stats
such
as
magic
resist
from
Abyssal
Scepter
and
attack
speed
from
Frozen
Heart
.
