Former
Gatekeeper
of

Rivals
Nasus
On
a
faraway
world,
Renekton
was
born
a
member
of
a
race
of
bestial
guardians
created
to
serve
as
the
rulers
and
protectors
of
their
people.
Alongside
his
brother
Nasus
,
Renekton
oversaw
the
upkeep
of
the
Great
Library,
which
served
as
both
a
vault
of
ancient
knowledge
and
the
repository
of
the
teachings
of
the
Cycle
of
Life
and
Death.
While
the
enlightened
Nasus
taught
those
scholars
who
came
to
study,
Renekton
served
as
the
Great
Library's
gatekeeper.
He
could
sense
the
true
natures
of
those
who
sought
Nasus'
teachings,
and
he
sent
away
those
with
dark
ambitions.
Over
time,
however,
his
repeated
exposure
to
this
evil
infected
his
mind.
He
grew
furious
with
the
malevolence
in
the
hearts
of
men,
and
as
he
descended
deeper
into
madness,
he
discovered
he
could
quell
the
fury
by
cutting
the
evil
from
the
men
who
possessed
it.
Unfortunately,
the
relief
was
as
short-lived
as
the
subjects,
and
the
butcher's
rage
,
as
it
came
to
be
known,
would
resurge
even
stronger.
Consumed
by
his
anger,
Renekton
turned
on
the
one
being
who
could
defeat
him
--
his
own
brother.
Nasus
pleaded
with
Renekton
to
see
reason.
Realizing
that
he
was
beyond
redemption,
the
despondent
Nasus
valiantly
struck
down
his
wayward
sibling.
Defenseless,
Renekton
waited
eagerly
for
death's
release.
It
never
came.
He
was
spared
when
summoners
from
the
League
of
Legends
claimed
his
brother.
Caught
in
the
wake
of
this
powerful
spell,
Renekton
tumbled
for
what
seemed
like
ages
between
realities.
When
he
finally
emerged,
he
fell
deep
into
the
sewers
of
Zaun
.
Insane
with
fury,
Renekton
languished
in
his
newfound
home,
driven
senseless
by
his
rage.
That
is
until,
by
happenstance,
he
caught
a
familiar
scent
in
the
air.
Believing
that
the
familiar
scent
would
guide
him
to
the
solace
that
was
fading
from
his
memory,
he
traced
his
brother
to
the
Institute
of
War
.
“My
brother
has
become
hollow.
Full
of
rage,
but
empty.”
―
Nasus,
the
Curator
of
the
Sands

CLE
OBSERVATION
The
bestial
creature
charges
into
the
hallway,
his
head
turning
erratically
from
side
to
side
as
he
seeks
his
target.
The
scent
that
he
has
been
relentlessly
trailing
all
the
way
from
Zaun
has
brought
him
to
the
Institute
of
War.
The
unmistakable
musk
saturates
the
Great
Hall.
Erupting
with
fury,
Renekton
drops
down
to
all
fours,
sending
his
enormous
weapon
crashing
to
the
marble
floor.
He
darts
around
the
room
to
trace
the
origin
of
the
scent.
There
is
a
frightening
madness
in
his
gaze,
and
his
every
movement
is
explosive.
Suddenly,
he
straightens
up,
snatching
up
his
blade
in
a
single
movement,
and
charges
recklessly
into
double
doors
framed
by
a
stone
archway.
The
creature
does
not
reach
out
to
part
the
doors;
they
simply
burst
open
from
the
sudden
impact
of
his
entire
body.
Renekton
doesn't
lose
his
stride
-
not
with
the
promise
of
his
prey
so
unbearably
close.
The
prey
is
none
other
than
his
brother,
Nasus.
What
the
creature
does
not
know
is
that
the
unrefusable
summons
that
took
away
his
brother
was
actually
meant
to
target
Renekton.
REFLECTION
Renekton
stumbles
as
a
wave
of
vertigo
washes
over
him.
The
floor
drops
out
under
his
feet,
and
after
a
sickening
moment
of
freefall,
he
finds
himself
back
on
solid
ground.
The
creature
rapidly
blinks
his
eyes
to
clear
a
filmy
haze
that
swirls
around
him.
Taking
a
hesitant
step
forward,
he
emerges
out
of
a
pillar
of
light
and
finds
himself
on
a
raised
stone
platform
overlooking
an
unfamiliar
forest.
The
smells
of
trees,
burning
torches,
and
magic
tinge
the
air.
He
surveys
his
surroundings,
clearly
puzzled
by
how
he
came
to
be
there.
The
sounds
of
struggle
can
be
heard
far
off
in
the
distance.
Suddenly,
his
brother's
unmistakable
scent
drifts
near
and
curls
around
his
nostrils.
Renekton
instinctively
launches
himself
forward,
his
legs
pumping
wildly
down
an
open
path
leading
into
the
forest.
His
elongated
jaw
hangs
open,
exposing
rows
of
wicked
looking
teeth
dripping
with
anticipation.
The
blood
boils
in
his
veins,
bulging
through
his
skin
in
spidery
patterns
that
run
up
and
down
his
massive
arms.
The
creature
turns
the
corner
to
find
Nasus
towering
over
a
pool
of
ineffectual
minions.
Clad
in
shining
gold
armor,
his
brother
expertly
spins
a
staff
over
his
head,
unleashing
a
spirit
flame
towards
the
minions.
The
ground
erupts
with
energy,
the
magic
radiating
in
a
brilliant
shimmer
as
it
consumes
the
small
creatures.
But
Renekton
sees
none
of
that.
All
he
sees
is
his
reckoning.
Renekton
springs
at
Nasus,
mowing
down
the
minions
who
have
the
misfortune
of
being
in
his
way.
The
sudden
appearance
of
his
long
lost
brother
barely
registers
in
Nasus’
mind
before
the
enormous
curved
blade
comes
whistling
through
the
air,
aimed
squarely
at
his
neck.
Nasus
narrowly
manages
to
dodge
the
attack,
disappearing
in
a
flash
of
light
and
re-emerging
a
safe
distance
away.
"Brother?!"
Renekton
charges
forward,
slashing
wildly
with
the
giant
blade.
Nasus
deflects
the
blows
with
his
staff,
slowly
being
knocked
back
with
every
attack.
"Brother,
stop!
What
are
you
doing
here?"
A
grin
snakes
down
the
length
of
Renekton's
face.
"Carnage!"
Renekton
crouches
for
a
split
second,
and
then
leaps
upward
with
blinding
speed.
Spinning
in
mid-air,
he
slashes
his
curved
blade
in
a
vicious
arc.
This
time,
the
blade
connects
with
flesh.
Nasus's
body
falls
to
the
ground,
and
Renekton
stands
over
him,
savoring
the
final
moments
before
he
destroys
his
brother.
In
a
beam
of
light,
his
brother's
body
vanishes.
Renekton
frantically
tears
at
the
ground
where
his
brother's
body
had
just
been,
his
claws
ripping
the
dirt
path.
He
twists
around
furiously,
but
the
forest
around
him
is
deserted.
A
guttural
roar
erupts
from
the
depths
of
his
being.
The
creature
catches
his
brother’s
scent
again
and
takes
off
in
a
dead
sprint
down
the
open
path.
In
the
distance,
he
sees
Nasus
appear
on
a
platform
similar
to
the
one
that
had
brought
him
here.
A
growl
rumbles
from
his
throat
as
he
charges
forward.
Three
defenders
appear
suddenly
at
the
base
of
an
intimidating
tower
at
the
top
of
the
steps,
outfitted
with
wicked
weapons
and
grim
expressions.
Renekton
bowls
through
them,
his
blade
deflecting
bullets
fired
at
point
blank
by
a
buxom
redhead.
A
bulky
minotaur
slams
the
ground
and
a
curiously
large
armadillo
drops
down
on
all
fours
to
defend
against
the
attack,
but
they
are
no
match
for
the
crocodile
in
bloodlust.
The
defenders
are
knocked
aside
in
Renekton's
mad
dash
for
Nasus.
The
creature
charges
up
the
steps,
flying
onto
the
platform
with
enormous
momentum.
Nasus
reaches
out
to
hold
up
his
palm,
as
if
to
stop
his
brother,
when
suddenly
a
bright
ray
of
light
shoots
out,
engulfing
him
in
an
agonizing
fire.
Renekton
immediately
succumbs
to
the
darkness.
The
creature
awakens
in
a
dark
room,
sprawled
on
a
frigid
stone
floor.
A
group
of
cloaked
magicians
stand
with
their
hands
outstretched
in
a
circle
around
him.
They
murmur
strange
words
under
their
breath,
ensnaring
him
in
a
glowing
net
of
magic.
When
Renekton's
vision
clears,
he
sees
his
brother
staring
dispassionately
at
him
from
across
the
room.
Renekton
snarls,
throwing
himself
bodily
towards
Nasus,
but
the
magical
chains
that
bind
him
hold
firm.
Nasus
gazes
back
for
a
long
moment,
his
expression
unreadable.
Then
he
turns
and
steps
into
a
lighted
platform.
Before
he
disappears,
Nasus
speaks.
"It
seems
that
the
time
to
settle
our
conflict
is
yet
to
be
determined.
Goodbye,
brother."
Throwing
his
head
back,
Renekton
lets
loose
a
roar
that
shakes
the
foundations
of
the
room.
The
violent
rage
caused
by
being
so
close
to
his
brother
and
utterly
unable
to
destroy
him
consumes
him.
The
summoners
standing
around
the
creature
don't
ask
the
standard
questions.
The
League
finally
has
its
chosen
brother.

Champion
Sneak
Peek
Announcement
made
in
the
sneak
peak
by
ByronicHero:
Lately,
we’ve
seen
quite
a
few
sibling
duos
enter
the
League
of
Legends.
While
Garen
and
Lux
may
have
been
the
first
to
make
membership
in
the
League
a
familial
affair,
since
then
Cassiopeia
and
Katarina
have
been
making
a
point
of
highlighting
the
importance
of
good
genes.
Of
course,
not
all
families
get
along,
and
if
we’re
going
to
broach
the
subject
of
sibling
rivalry
there’s
probably
no
better
place
to
start
than
with
Nasus’
brother
Renekton,
the
Butcher
of
the
Sands.
We’re
personally
not
sure
that
we’ve
ever
seen
a
fraternal
relationship
with
more
animosity
(no
pun
intended).
