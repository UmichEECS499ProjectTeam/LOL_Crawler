as
a
single
target
ability.
Spell
vamp
is
fully
applied.
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
will
apply
a
35%
slow.
The
triggering
attack
will
apply
other
on-hit
effects
and
can
critically
strike
as
normal.
Critical
strikes
will
not
interact
with
Grandmaster's
Might's
bonus
damage.
PENDING
FOR

Grandmaster's
Might's
interaction
with
dodge

.
Spell
shields
will
block
the
ability.
Additional
Information:
Grandmaster's
Might
has
no
cast
time
and
does
not
interrupt
Jax's
previous
orders.
Despite
being
an
on-hit
effect,
Grandmaster's
Might's
damage
will
trigger
spell
effects
as
a
single-target
spell,
including
spell
vamp
,
Rylai's
slow
and
will
cause
Muramana's
bonus
damage
to
trigger
twice
with
one
autoattack.
The
bonus
damage
every
third
attack
will
not
damage
structures.
Hits
against
them
will
increment
the
counter
but
will
not
consume
the
enhanced
autoattack,
resulting
in
Jax
repeatedly
triggering
the
loud
sound
effect.
The
bonus
armor
and
magic
resistance
is
only
calculated
once
when
the
ability
is
cast.
Further
changes
to
Jax's
magic
resistance
and
armor
will
not
cause
the
bonus
stats
to
dynamically
adjust.
