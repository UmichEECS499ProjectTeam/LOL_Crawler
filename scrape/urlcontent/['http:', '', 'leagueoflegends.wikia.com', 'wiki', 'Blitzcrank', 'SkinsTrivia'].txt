Trivia
Blitzcrank
was
designed
by
Ezreal
(person)
.
If
Rocket
Grab
is
cast
and
Blitzcrank
moves,
his
hand
will
disappear
as
it
has
not
been
retracted
yet.
Blitzcrank's
style
of
play
bears
a
resemblance
to
the
DotA
character,
Pudge.
This
is
mostly
due
to
Blitzcrank's
Rocket
Grab
skill
and
Pudge's
Meat
Hook
having
similar
mechanics.
Though
Blitzcrank
uses
his
right
arm
for
Rocket
Grab
,
the
picture
used
for
it
displays
his
left
hand.
In
the
lore
Blitzcrank
runs
a
dating
service
called
"Blitzcrank's
Fleshling
Compatibility
Services."
His
dance
is
a
reference
to
the
Macarena
,
a
popular
Spanish
song.
Blitzcrank's
lore
is
similar
to
that
of
the
Bicentennial
Man,
a
movie
based
on
a
short
story
by
Isaac
Asimov,
where
the
main
character
is
a
sentient
robot
played
by
Robin
Williams.
Blitzcrank's
name
consists
of
'Blitz',
a
German
word
for
lightning,
and
'crank',
an
English
word
denoting
turning
parts
of
machinery,
starting-levers
in
particular.
Quotes
Blitzcrank's
quote,
"
Exterminate
"
is
a
reference
to
the
popular
villains
in
Doctor
Who
,
The
Daleks.
This
may
also
be
a
reference
to
Evil
Robots
in
movies,
who
have
a
tendancy
to
say
"Exterminate".
The
quote:
"
A
rolling
golem
gathers
no
rust
"
is
derived
from
the
adage
"A
rolling
stone
gathers
no
moss".
Blitzcrank's
quote:
"
The
magic
calls
to
me
"
is
almost
exactly
like
a
quote
from
Veigar
:
"
The
magic,
it
calls
to
me!
".
Skins
Rusty
Blitzcrank
is
the
only
non-limited
edition
event
skins
to
be
removed
from
the
store,
ostensibly
because
of
low
quality,
as
it
was
almost
identical
to
his
basic
skin.
Piltover
Customs
Blitzcrank
was
the
first
skin
presented
by
GANK
Industries,
though
that
information
was
classified
until
April
2.
Piltover
Customs
Blitzcrank's
license
plate
reads
"BLITZY1".
The
boxing
gloves
for
Boom
Boom
Blitzcrank
have
the
acronym
"LOL"
on
one
and
the
word
"PWN"
on
the
other.
The
Goalkeeper
Blitzcrank
skin,
along
with
the
soccer
skins
for
other
champions,
appeared
just
before
the
2010
World
Cup
started,
and
were
removed
from
the
store
on
October
31,
2010
The
iBlitzcrank
skin
is
possibly
a
reference
to
the
I,
Robot
movie
featuring
Will
Smith,
but
it
is
more
likely
a
reference
to
the
company
Apple
and
their
brand
of
"iTech"
(iPhone,
iPad,
etc.).
This
is
likely
due
the
League
of
Legends
Mac
client
being
released
at
the
same
time
when
the
iBlitzcrank
skin
became
available.
In
Riot
Blitzcrank's
Skin
Splash
art,
Riot
Graves
can
be
seen
in
the
background
Blitzcrank
shares
the
Riot
skin
with
Graves,
Nasus
and
Singed.
His
back
animation
includes
an
helicopter
getting
out
of
his
hat.
This
is
very
similar
to
the
iconic
Inspector
Gadget's
heli-hat,
who
also
happen
to
be
a
crime-fighting
police
robot.
Relations
Blitzcrank
was
originally
created
by
Viktor
but
the
credit
for
his
work
was
stolen
by
Professor
Stanwick.
He
still,
however,
retains
his
connections
with
Viktor.
They
are
in
good
terms
aswell.
[1]
In
the
Journal
of
Justice
,
it
was
stated
that
Rammus
is
close
friends
with
Blitzcrank
,
having
a
similar
good
nature
to
them.
Blitzcrank
and
Singed
are
on
unfriendly
terms.
