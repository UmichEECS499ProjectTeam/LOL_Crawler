N/A
Tibbers
is
a
shadow
bear,
a
ferocious
denizen
of
the
petrified
forests
in
the
Voodoo
Lands
.
Lore
Just
outside
the
forest,
a
shadow
bear
would
terrorize
the
Gray
Order
colony,
a
group
of
Noxian
outcasts
who
chose
to
reside
in
the
Voodoo
Lands
to
live
in
peace.
He
was
later
tamed
by
Annie
The
Dark
Child
,
turning
him
into
her
pet.
To
this
day
Tibbers
remains
by
her
side,
spellbound
as
a
stuffed
doll
to
be
carried
like
a
child's
toy.
Trivia
Summon:
Tibbers
is
Annie's
ultimate
.
Tibbers
deals
35
(+20%
AP)
magic
damage
per
second
in
an
area
around
him.
Tibbers
can
be
controlled
with
Alt
+
right-click
and
with
the
ultimate's
hotkey.
Tibbers
is
classified
as
a
minion
,
so
it
can
be
targeted
by
Nunu's
Consume
and
Smite
,
and
it
can
be
picked
up
and
thrown
by
Syndra's
Force
of
Will
.
If
Tibbers
damages
an
enemy
champion
under
an
enemy
turret
while
Annie
is
in
range
of
the
turret,
the
turret
will
attack
Annie
instead
of
Tibbers,
as
is
with
all
pets
.
Killing
Tibbers
will
grant
you
50
gold
.
