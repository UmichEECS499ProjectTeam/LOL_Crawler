Lore
Valoran
Mogron
Pass
during
the
Rune
Wars.
Until
only
twenty
years
ago,
Runeterra
was
on
a
collision
course
with
disaster.
As
quickly
as
Runeterra's
denizens
would
band
together
in
ancient
times
as
tribes,
opposing
tribes
would
war
to
settle
their
disputes.
No
matter
the
era,
the
preferred
choice
of
warfare
has
always
been
magical.
Armies
would
be
enhanced
or
decimated
by
spell
and
rune
alike.
Champions
made
the
most
of
magical
items
forged
for
them
as
they
led
or
supported
armies.
Summoners
–
often
the
de
facto
leaders
of
Valoran's
political
forces
–
would
unleash
mighty
magical
powers
directly
against
foes
and
their
holdings
with
little
regard
for
consequence.
With
such
an
abundance
of
raw
magical
power
at
their
disposal,
there
was
little
motivation
for
summoners
to
explore
more
environmentally-friendly
forms
of
warfare.
Within
the
last
two
hundred
years,
however,
the
dangers
of
unchecked
magical
warfare
began
to
expose
the
fragility
of
Runeterra
to
everyone
residing
in
Valoran
.
The
last
two
Rune
Wars
drastically
altered
the
geophysical
landscape
of
Valoran,
even
after
magical
energy
was
focused
on
restoring
it.
Violent
earthquakes
and
horrific
magically-fueled
storms
made
life
on
Valoran
challenging,
even
before
factoring
in
the
horror
of
warfare
on
the
populace.
It
was
theorized
that
another
unchecked
Rune
War
would
tear
the
world
asunder.
The
Institute
of
War
As
a
direct
response
to
the
world's
growing
physical
and
political
instability,
Valoran's
key
magicians
–
including
many
powerful
summoners
–
came
to
the
conclusion
that
conflicts
needed
to
be
resolved
in
a
controllable
and
systemic
way.
They
formed
an
organization
called
the
League
of
Legends
,
whose
purpose
was
to
oversee
the
orderly
resolution
of
political
conflict
in
Valoran.
Housed
in
the
Institute
of
War,
the
League
would
be
given
the
authority
by
Valoran's
political
entities
to
govern
the
outcomes
of
the
organized
conflict
they
would
administer.
