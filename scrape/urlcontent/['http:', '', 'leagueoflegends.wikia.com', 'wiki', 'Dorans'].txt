Effrem
E.
Doran
is
an
unknown
non-playable
character
in
League
of
Legends
,
who
is
best
known
for
his
creation
of
three
starter
items
.
Doran
is
the
creator
of
Wukong's
staff,
which
is
said
to
be
"an
unrivalled
masterpiece."
He
is
also
the
creator
of
the
following
items:
Doran's
Blade
Doran's
Ring
Doran's
Shield
The
Journal
of
Justice:
Volume
1,
Issue
18
sheds
light
to
the
lore
behind
Doran's
story:
“What
is
the
story
of
Doran
and
his
trinkets
that
the
League
so
frequently
uses?
Who
was
Doran?
When
did
he
live?
Why
did
he
create
these
items?
I've
always
been
curious
as
to
the
origins
of
these
items
I
use
so
frequently
in
my
matches.”
–
Summoner
Afrasabi
of
Noxus
The
story
of
Doran
tugs
at
the
heartstrings.
They
say
Effrem
E.
Doran
was
born
with
a
hammer
in
his
hands
and
a
forge
in
his
heart.
Every
object
he
touched,
he
found
ways
to
improve,
and
he
knew
that
he
was
destined
to
be
a
brilliant
artificer.
At
the
age
of
15,
he
was
invited
to
the
League
with
an
offer
to
assume
the
role
of
Master
Artificer,
a
dream
come
true
and
an
unprecedented
honor
for
one
so
young.
However,
fate
had
other
plans.
En
route,
his
carriage
broke
an
axle.
When
he
leaned
down
to
inspect
it,
he
was
kicked
in
the
head
by
his
donkey,
a
stern
blow.
He
stumbled
back
onto
the
wagon,
but
when
he
arrived
at
the
Institute
of
War
he
was
a
different
boy.
The
kick
had
rendered
his
mind
soft,
but
it
hadn’t
robbed
him
of
his
passion.
He
still
wanted
nothing
other
than
to
craft,
but
where
once
he
may
have
created
singular
masterpieces,
he
now
crafted…somewhat
simpler
items,
and
many
of
them.
He
is
a
kind,
goofy,
good-hearted
soul,
and
he
takes
pride
in
the
work
he
does.
His
items
are
daily
selected
by
champions
on
the
Fields
of
Justice,
and
he
has
a
permanent
home
at
the
Institute.
Trivia
Doran
created
Wukong's
staff
after
the
accident,
and
as
such,
he
still
remains
a
master
inventor.
It
is
likely
that
he
has
also
created
the
Prospector
items,
as
they
are
the
Dominion
counterparts
of
his
other
inventions.
