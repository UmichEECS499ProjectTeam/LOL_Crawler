which
took
place
on
May

They
are
living
like
shadows
in
her
cobijo
like
a
wherever
you
are.
Winners
of
season
one
and
two
in
a
row
arrow
in
the
face
like
Ashe
when
hit
six,
you
know.
The
team
was
ruled
out
from
the
Season

World
Championship
qualification
by
Saigon
Jokers

the
Grand
Final
of
Season

defeated
by
the
Taipei
Assasins
in
Round

was
placed

overrall.
Roster
Changes
One
major
twist
from
the
team,
dubbed
Singapore
Sentinels
v2.0
,
reshuffled
roles
to
accommodate
the
new
line-up
of
the
team
and
was
used
against
the
Taipei
Assassins
during
the
Garena
Premier
League.
The
reshuffled
roles
was
due
to
ToFuBoi's
leave
for
compulsory
military
service.
SGS
Equivocal
anounced
his
leave
on
December
21st
2012
due
to
personal
reasons
and
recruited
hyhy
on
the
January
10th
2013
to
play
as
AD
Carry.
