Those

and
will

normal

Note
that
some
champions
are
capable
of
more
than
just
the
role
or
roles
they
are
listed
under.
A
champion's
abilities,
items
they
gain
throughout
the
game,
and
one's
ability
to
fulfill
that
duty
determine
what
role
they
assume
in
gameplay.
As
of
V3.10
,
tags
for
secondary
attributes
are
no
longer
visible
in
the
game
client,
but
have
been
retained
here
for
information
purposes.
Primary
Attributes
Assassin
:
Champions
with
mediocre
auto-attacks
and
defense,
who
specialize
in
killing
their
enemies
quickly.
These
champions
usually
are
physical
attackers
and
are
DPS-based
(Damage
per
second)
or
are
AP
(ability
power)
burst
oriented.
Many
of
them
have
some
form
of
invisibility
or
blinking
ability
which
lets
them
choose
the
right
moment
to
step
in
or
out
of
a
fight.
They
should
focus
on
items
that
will
increase
the
damage
they
put
out
over
a
short
period
of
time.
In
fights,
they
play
a
role
as
sneak
attackers
of
key
targets
(like
the
marksman
or
the
mage),
who
pick
off
weak
enemies
and
carry
champions
at
the
right
time.
They
should
not
be
played
for
frontal
engagements
in
team
fights
since
they
lack
good
defense
compared
to
fighters
and
tanks.
Assassins
focus
on
timing
and
positioning,
rather
than
brute
strength
or
defense,
to
ensure
their
kills.
Assassins
usually
kill
marksmen,
supports,
and
most
mages
with
ease,
but
perform
worse
against
fighters
and
tanks.
Fighter
(also
known
as
Bruiser
or
Off-tank
):
Champions
that
blend
the
attributes
of
a
damager
and
tank,
combining
moderate
to
heavy
survivability
with
a
portion
of
the
damage
of
an
assassin
or
marksman
(essentially
half
tank,
half
DPS).
They
lack
the
front-loaded,
destructive
damage
of
their
pure
DPS
counterparts,
but
usually
have
abilities
which
increase
their
damage
output
or
abilities
with
high
damage
bases,
making
them
deadlier
in
the
early
game.
Fighters
can
build
to
be
extremely
survivable,
but
the
key
distinction
between
tanky
fighters
and
true
tanks
is
that
tanks
are
designed
to
draw
damage
and
disrupt
enemies,
while
fighters
deal
damage.
In
a
team
fight,
fighter
champions
can
surrogate
the
role
of
a
tank
or
assassin,
and
many
have
powerful
fight-initiation
abilities.
With
their
special
blend
of
defense,
damage,
and
mobility,
fighters
can
pierce
through
enemy
lines
to
reach
and
destroy
squishier
targets
while
withstanding
moderate
damage.
Fighters
can
usually
take
1v1
almost
any
other
role,
however
their
weakness
is
that
they
can't
dish
out
damage
as
reliably
as
a
marksman
or
as
quickly
as
a
mage
or
help
as
support;
usually,
their
role
in
late-game
is
more
to
defend
or
back
up
the
primary
damage
dealers
in
a
team
fight.
Most
fighters
fall
off
in
late
game
due
to
their
abilities
having
low
scaling
ratios
(but
very
high
bases).
Mage
:
(also
known
as
APC
:
Ability
Power
Carry
)
Mostly
ranged
champions
with
powerful
magic
damage
skills,
good
crowd
control
or
a
combination
of
both,
but
low
defense
and
weak
auto-attacks.
Some
are
meant
to
deal
a
high
amount
of
damage
in
a
short
period
of
time
(burst
casters/burst
mages)
while
others
usually
deal
damage
over
time;
however,
even
DoT
mages
tend
to
have
at
least
one
nuke.
Most
mages
present
the
user
with
a
flexible,
versatile,
and
powerful
skillset.
Like
marksman
champions,
they
can
bring
their
team
to
victory
due
to
their
ability
power
,
but
burst
based
mages
tend
to
fall
of
a
bit
at
late
game.
They
require
tanky
teammates
for
protection
since
they
lack
high
durability
as
they
are
capable
of
dishing
out
tremendous
damage
to
the
enemy
team
with
their
abilities.
Otherwise,
enemy
teams
can
easily
pick
them
off,
especially
since
few
mages
have
outstanding
mobility.
Mage
champions
easily
kill
marksmen,
other
mages
and
supports
(assasins
too,
but
they
have
to
get
caught
out
of
position
or
by
surprise),
and
a
few
mages
with
supreme
bursts
can
even
kill
fighters
1v1,
however,
the
large
majority
of
mages
can't
hit
hard
enough
to
kill
a
fighter
and
those
who
can
have
to
channel
a
combo(
Malzahar
)
or
take
a
while
to
fully
execute
their
skills
(
Syndra
,
Xerath
)
Some
mages
work
more
like
marksmen,
having
high
sustained
damage
rather
than
the
"burst",
normally
associated
with
mages;
this
trait
allows
them
to
take
on
tanks
and
fighters
more
effectively,
though
mages
with
this
trait
are
less
effective
against
quick
damage
dealers
like
assassins.
Some
mages
have
abilities
with
high
base
damage,
and
if
they
are
doing
well,
they
can
get
somewhat
tankier
or
supportive
without
sacrificing
much
damage.
Range
between
mages
is
very
defining;
low
ranged
mages
have
to
build
tanky
ability
power
items,
otherwise
they
would
die
as
soon
as
they
enter
their
damage
range.
The
short
range
comes
with
rewards
however,
higher-than
usual
damage
(either
sustained
or
up-front
but
extremely
high)
(
Cassiopeia
,
Swain
,
LeBlanc
,
or
Vladimir
),
outstanding
crowd
control
(
Lissandra
)
or
naturally
increased
tankyness
and
survivality
(
Swain
,
or
Vladimir
).
The
long
ranged
ones
on
the
other
hand,
can
freely
build
"glass
cannon"
as
they
have
either
extremely
long
range
(
Xerath
)
or
are
very
hard
to
catch
or
kill
(
Lux
,
or
Nidalee
).
Marksman
:
(also
Known
as
ADC
:
Attack
Damage
Carry
or
just
Carry
)
Champions
with
high
auto-attack
damage,
usually
long
range,
but
low
defense.
Most
marksmen
have
skills,
passive
or
active,
that
scales
with
their
stats,
such
as
an
increase
in
Base
Damage
and
Attack
Speed
or
allowing
them
to
keep
themself
safe,
and
rely
on
their
auto-attack
to
dish
out
damage.
Marksman
champions
are
extremely
effective
late-game
at
"carrying"
the
team
to
victory,
either
by
killing
off
key
players
on
the
enemy
team
or
dealing
large
damage
in
team
fights
because
they
have
tremendous
damage
output,
but
low
defense.
Due
to
this,
they
are
key
champions
and
are
primary
targets
for
enemy
team
.
As
a
result,
they
require
tanky
teammates
like
fighters
and
tanks
for
protection
as
they
lack
survivability.
Some
marksmen
function
more
like
ranged
AD
casters
that
are
more
dependent
on
casting
skills
that
deal
high
amounts
of
burst
damage
than
autoattacking
(
Ezreal
,
Miss
Fortune
,
and
Graves
).
Other
marksmen
are
more
reliant
on
autoattacking
and
more
focused
on
building
attack
speed
,
Critical
chance,
items
that
boosts
their
autoattacks
(i.e.
Blade
of
the
Ruined
King
),
and
life
steal
instead
for
damage
per
second
(
Tristana
,
Vayne
,
and
Kog'Maw
)
Marksmen
can
only
usually
beat
supports
and
tanks
1v1
but
kill
everything
if
they
are
protected.
Due
to
their
low
health
marksmen
are
almost
always
beaten
by
the
high
burst
that
Mages
output.
Due
to
(most)
marksmen
not
being
all
too
reliant
on
abilities,
rather
using
autoattacks
to
deal
damage,
they
are
capable
of
dealing
a
lot
of
damage
over
a
longer
period
of
time
compared
to
mages.
Support
:
Champions
whose
skills
are
meant
to
directly
aid
the
rest
of
the
team.
They
can
either
babysit
a
champion
to
make
laning
easier
for
them
by
providing
healing,
buffing
allies,
applying
debuffs
to
the
enemy
team,
or
a
combination
of
the
above.
The
most
common
ability
for
a
support
champion
is
providing
an
ally
with
a
shield
of
some
kind
or
annoying
the
enemy
with
some
form
of
strong
crowd
control.
One
of
the
main
goals
of
a
support
is
to
let
their
lane
partner
farm
minions
for
gold,
as
supports
can
buy
key
gold+
items
to
get
gold
for
themselves,
as
well
as
controlling
the
map
with
wards,
warding
all
key
areas
of
the
map.
These
champions
usually
rely
on
their
skills
more
than
their
auto-attack.
Supports
can't
really
kill
anything
but
other
supports
on
their
own,
but
their
buffs
and
harsh
CC
makes
them
deadly
when
paired
along
with
any
other
role
but
tanks.
A
few
supports
have
ability
power
ratios
high
enough
to
let
them
become
mages,
and
a
few
mages
have
supportive
abilities/aggressive
crowd
control
which
lets
them
become
supports.
Supports
can
often
use
their
CC
to
interrupt
assassins
and
protect
nearby
mages
and
marksmen.
Tank
:
Champions
with
extremely
high
defense,
health,
and
crowd
control
abilities,
but
low
attack
damage
or
poor
ability
power
scaling.
Tanks
are
usually
champions
that
combine
high
amounts
of
health,
armor,
and
magic
resistance.
If
left
alone,
tanks
are
able
to
absorb
high
amounts
of
damage
or
create
disables
on
their
foes,
which
make
them
great
harassers
as
well.
In
battle,
this
type
of
champion
is
usually
expected
to
start/initiate
(or
at
least
be
in
the
front
of)
the
team
fight
;
soaking
up
damage,
and
helping
focus
certain
enemies
(marksman
and
mage
champions).
Due
to
their
low
damage
output,
they
must
rely
on
their
assassin,
marksman,
fighter,
and
mage
champions
to
finish
the
enemy
off
or
chase
them
down
when
they
initially
weakened
them.
As
a
result,
tanks
are
not
expected
to
gain
high
kills
but
more
assists.
Tank
champions
should
coordinate
team
fights
by
telling
the
team
to
retreat
or
advance
when
necessary
since
they
lead
the
charge.
They
are
also
meant
to
be
a
protector
of
the
team,
and
must
be
willing
to
sacrifice
themselves
for
vulnerable
allies
if
necessary.
Tanks
can
usually
kill
mages,
as
a
mage's
full
burst
will
rarely
take
the
tank
below
50%
health,
and
are
left
open
for
the
tank's
slow,
steady
damage
output;
however,
DoT
mages
might
be
harder
to
deal
with.
Some
tanks
have
very
high
ratios
on
their
abilities
and
if
they
are
doing
well
enough
they
can
leave
a
bit
their
tankiness
to
get
damage.
In
a
manner
similar
to
many
supports,
most
tanks
can
use
CC
to
interrupt
assasins,
but
they
can
also
use
them
to
lock
down
mages
or
marksmen
using
their
defenses
to
be
able
to
safely
position
themselves
within
the
enemy
lines.
Secondary
Attributes
Jungler
:
Champions
that
can
easily
farm
monsters
in
the
jungle
at
an
early
stage
in
the
game
and
can
typically
take
out
minions
waves
quickly.
They
usually
excel
at
taking
down
opponents
when
they
can
catch
them
off
guard
in
lane.
Some
champions
jungle
because
their
lane
phase
isn't
that
strong
(easily
harassed,
high
mana
dependency
early
on)
and
others
are
capable
of
both.
Many
fighters,
assassins
and
tanks
can
take
the
role
of
jungler;
though
it
is
generally
expected
that
the
champion
will
have
some
form
of
self
sustain
.
Melee
:
Champions
that
have
a
melee
basic
attack,
so
they
have
to
be
very
close
to
their
target
in
order
to
do
damage.
They
usually
have
more
health,
armor
and
magic
resistance
than
ranged
champions
as
well
as
heals.
Most
tanks
and
fighters
are
melee
combatants,
although
melee
mages
are
not
uncommon.
Pusher
:
Champions
that
can
quickly
kill
minion
waves
or
destroy
turrets
in
a
short
amount
of
time.
Typically,
pusher
champions
have
pets,
AoE
abilities,
or
a
high
amount
of
attack
speed.
Ranged
:
Champions
whose
basic
attack
can
cause
damage
at
a
distance
(see
range
),
allowing
them
to
avoid
many
harmful
risks
and
increasing
their
flee
capability.
Ranged
Champions
are
divided
into
two
sub-categories:
Mage
and
Marksmen
champions.
Mages
have
a
weak
auto-attack
and
focus
on
high
damage
spells
or
support,
while
marksmen
tend
to
focus
more
on
frequent,
powerful
auto-attacks.
Recommended
:
Champions
whose
skills
don't
involve
any
complicated
mechanics
and
playing
them
effectively
does
not
require
extensive
knowledge
of
the
other
champions.
They
are
all
1350
or
lower,
with
the
exception
of
Sona
,
Rammus
and
Katarina
,
who
cost
3150
.
There
is
usually
at
least
1
recommended
champion
every
free
week.
Stealth
:
Champions
that
possess
at
least
one
ability
that
allows
them
to
become
invisible
to
enemies
(other
than
when
near
turrets
and
vision
wards).
This
attribute
is
mainly
for
assassin
champions.
