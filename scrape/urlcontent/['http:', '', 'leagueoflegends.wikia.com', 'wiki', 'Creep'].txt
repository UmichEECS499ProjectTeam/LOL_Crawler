Redirected
from
Creep
A
group
of
minions.
Minions
are
expendable
allied
units
that
are
generated
automatically
to
charge
into
battle
with
the
purpose
of
attacking
enemy
units
in
the
lanes
they
are
assigned.
The
blue
and
purple
team
minions
spawn
every
30
seconds
from
the
Nexus
in
order
to
support
the
champions
.
Minions
begin
spawning
1
minute
30
seconds
after
the
game
has
begun.
Every
3
minutes
the
minion
waves
will
grow
stronger,
with
every
type
of
minion
gaining
different
stats.
Minions
deal
50%
increased
damage
to
turrets
and
deal
about
15%
reduced
damage
to
enemy
champions.
Note:
Minions
should
not
be
confused
with
monsters
,
which
are
neutral
unless
attacked
and
reside
in
the
jungle.

they

the

Showdown

Lore
Minions
are
constructs
of
the
League,
used
specifically
for
battle
arenas.
They
aren't
sentient.
In
the
earliest
days
of
the
League
–
during
their
extensive
testing
phase
–
there
was
a
rumor
that
they
were
using
sentient
beings
as
minions.
They
even
supposedly
used
necromancy
to
summon
skeletal
minions
to
fight
as
the
minions
of
today
do.
Such
rumors
are
generally
thought
to
be
unsubstantiated.
Types
There
are
five
types
of
minions
that
are
currently
in
the
game.
Melee
Melee
minions
charge
directly
towards
the
closest
enemy.
Caster
Caster
minions
attack
enemies
from
a
range
of
600
with
bolts
of
energy
that
are
the
same
color
as
their
team's.
They
deal
more
damage
than
their
melee
counterparts
but
are
otherwise
inferior.
Siege
Siege
minions
attack
enemies
from
a
range
of
450
with
cannon
balls.
They
receive
30%
less
damage
from
turrets.
Siege
minions
have
most
health
and
deal
most
damage
from
the
regular
wave
minions.
Anti-turret
cannon
A
siege
minion
that
is
promoted
turns
in
to
a
Anti-turret
cannon
(ATC)
thus
gaining
increased
attack
speed
,
armor
,
magic
resistance
,
health
and
its
kills
donate
the
gold
to
its
promoter.
ATC's
are
the
best
and
strongest
among
the
regular
minions.
Super
A
Super
minion
is
spawned
in
each
wave
to
a
lane
in
which
the
enemy
inhibitor
is
destroyed.
They
will
continue
spawning
until
the
inhibitor
respawns,
which
takes
four
minutes.
It
replaces
the
wave's
siege
minion
and,
similarly
to
it,
it
takes
30%
less
damage
from
turrets.
They
deal
more
damage
and
have
more
health
than
any
other
minion,
but
have
the
lowest
armor
and
magic
resistance.
Behavior
Minions
and
turrets
will
only
deviate
from
their
standard
behavior
to
come
to
the
aid
of
an
ally
under
duress.
Whenever
any
unit
is
under
attack,
it
generates
a
‘call
for
help’.
Minions
and
turrets
have
slightly
different
reactions
to
a
call
for
help.
Under
normal
circumstances,
a
minion’s
behavior
is
simple.
Minions
follow
their
attack
route
until
they
reach
an
enemy
to
engage.
Every
few
seconds,
they
will
scan
the
area
around
them
for
the
highest
priority
target.
When
a
minion
receives
a
call
for
help
from
an
ally,
it
will
evaluate
its
current
target
in
relation
to
the
target
designated
by
the
call.
It
will
switch
its
attack
to
the
new
target
if
and
only
if
the
new
target
is
of
a
higher
priority
than
their
current
target.
Minions
prioritize
targets
in
the
following
order:
An
enemy
champion
designated
by
a
call
for
help
from
an
allied
champion.
(Enemy
champion
attacking
an
Allied
champion)
An
enemy
minion
designated
by
a
call
for
help
from
an
allied
champion.
(Enemy
minion
attacking
an
Allied
champion)
An
enemy
minion
designated
by
a
call
for
help
from
an
allied
minion.
(Enemy
minion
attacking
an
Allied
minion)
An
enemy
turret
designated
by
a
call
for
help
from
an
allied
minion.
(Enemy
turret
attacking
an
Allied
minion)
An
enemy
champion
designated
by
a
call
for
help
from
an
allied
minion.
(Enemy
champion
attacking
an
Allied
minion)
The
closest
enemy
minion.
The
closest
enemy
champion.
Because
they
are
continuously
reevaluating
their
target,
minions
will
lose
interest
in
an
enemy
champion
if
that
champion
breaks
off
an
engagement
with
them,
provided
that
there
is
any
other
target
left
for
them
to
choose
within
range.
Minions
will
only
reevaluate
their
target
every
few
seconds.
This
means
that
if
a
champion
initiates
an
attack
against
an
enemy
champion,
the
attacking
champion
will
continue
to
be
viewed
as
the
most
threatening
target
for
a
short
time
after
they
have
broken
off
the
attack.
This
is
true
even
if
one
of
their
allied
champions
has
joined
the
fight,
since
minions
always
prioritize
their
current
target
over
a
new
target
of
equal
priority.
If
a
targeted
champion
leaves
the
minions'
sight,
the
minions
will
automatically
reevaluate
their
target
and
will
carry
on
walking
or
attacking
something
else.
Lane
Management
and
Last
Hitting
Tips
Although
experience
is
given
any
time
a
champion
is
in
a
certain
range
of
a
minion
that
dies,
a
champion
may
only
receive
the
gold
if
that
champion
delivered
the
killing
blow.
Landing
the
final
autoattack
on
minions
is
referred
to
as
last
hitting
in
the
League
of
Legends
community.
It
is
the
best
way
to
pick
up
the
minion's
bounty
without
pushing
the
lane
much.
Constantly
autoattacking
minions
always
pushes
the
lane,
which
leaves
the
champion
more
vulnerable
to
attacks
from
junglers.
Champions
can
also
use
their
abilities
to
last
hit,
however,
having
an
ability
on
cooldown
or
even
having
to
spend
a
resource
(e.g.
Mana)
always
puts
you
into
a
disadvantage.
When
choosing
to
use
an
ability
to
last
hit,
this
should
always
be
taken
into
account.
As
killing
minions
(creep
score
or
CS)
is
generally
the
only
way
to
gain
gold
in
lane
beyond
gold
over
time
(because
kills
and
assists
are
not
guaranteed),
it
is
considered
very
important.
Freezing
a
lane
is
essentially
stopping
the
enemy
minions
from
pushing
the
lane
any
further
than
it
already
is.
It
is
generally
used
in
combination
with
zoning
to
keep
enemy
champions
from
experience
and
minions
and
allow
a
jungler
to
gank.
Keep
in
mind
that
freezing
a
lane
will
leave
a
greater
amount
of
enemy
minions
than
allied
minions
and
can
mean
a
significant
amount
of
extra
damage
in
any
all-ins
or
sustained
trades.
The
first
condition
for
this
tactic
to
work,
the
enemy
minions
must
already
be
pushing.
Generally,
one
can
leave
a
few
extra
enemy
minions
(about
half
a
minion
wave
or
three
is
good,
preferably
ranged
minions).
You
may
have
to
tank
a
few
minion
hits
to
keep
the
lane
from
pushing
in
between
minion
waves.
Notes
Minions
as
they
appeared
during
Beta
.
If
the
champions
do
not
interfere
in
the
battle,
one
team
of
minions
will
eventually
win
the
game.
Which
team
will
win
is
completely
random,
depending
on
which
team
focuses
the
enemy
minions
better.
When
minions
scan
for
a
target,
it
is
possible
for
a
champion
to
pick
up
aggro
multiple
times
from
a
minion.
Minions
can
constantly
pick
up
aggro
from
you
and
can
follow
you
through
the
jungle.
