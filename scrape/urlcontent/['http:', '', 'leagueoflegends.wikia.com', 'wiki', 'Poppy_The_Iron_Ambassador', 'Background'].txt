Occupation
Ambassador,
former

Faction
Bandle
City
,
Demacia
Friends
Galio
While
other
young
yordle
girls
played
skip-step
and
braided
wreathes
out
of
posies,
Poppy
spent
her
youth
earning
calluses
and
grease
stains
in
her
father's
armor
shop.
Blomgrun,
her
father,
was
Bandle
City's
finest
smith.
The
only
thing
he
loved
as
much
as
his
work
was
his
young
daughter,
Poppy
-
named
for
the
sprightly
sounds
of
the
sparks
that
leapt
from
his
ever-burning
forge.
He
swelled
with
pride
the
day
she
was
first
able
to
lift
his
trusty
hammer,
Whomper.
Poppy
immediately
took
to
his
art,
demonstrating
a
natural
gift
for
smithing,
which
Blomgrun
honed
with
devoted
instruction.
One
day,
a
Demacian
general
named
Florin
Berell
commissioned
Blomgrun
to
craft
a
helm,
glorious
beyond
comparison.
Blomgrun
toiled
away
on
this
project,
determined
to
present
Florin
with
his
finest
work.
He
let
Poppy
set
the
center
jewel,
entrusting
her
with
the
most
important
piece.
When
the
pair
finished,
they
departed
for
Demacia
to
deliver
it
in
person.
Word
of
the
general's
order,
however,
was
leaked
to
the
Noxian
High
Command,
and
two
Noxian
assassins
were
dispatched
to
intercept
the
delivery.
Blomgrun
was
able
to
occupy
the
assassins
long
enough
for
Poppy
to
escape
with
the
prized
helm.
She
watched
helplessly
from
the
brush
as
her
father
was
slain.
Instead
of
fleeing
home,
she
carried
the
helm
the
rest
of
the
way
to
Demacia
alone.
She
refused
payment
for
it,
saying
that
no
amount
would
compensate
for
her
father's
life.
Instead,
she
offered
it
as
a
gift,
honoring
her
father's
final
intentions.
Florin
saw
the
grim
determination
behind
the
tears
in
her
eyes,
and
requested
that
the
leadership
of
Bandle
City
appoint
Poppy
as
the
yordle
ambassador
to
Demacia.
Soon
after,
seeking
to
crush
Noxus
with
her
father's
hammer,
Poppy
volunteered
for
the
League
of
Legends
.
"Poppy
may
be
small,
but
Whomper
-
or
her
will
-
is
not."

V1.0.0.116
:
While
other
young
yordles
would
play
skip-step
and
make
wreathes
out
of
braided
posies,
Poppy
was
earning
calluses
and
grease
stains
in
her
father's
armor
shop.
Blomgrun
was
a
well-respected
armorsmith,
and
he
named
his
daughter
for
the
sprightly
sounds
that
accompanied
the
sparks
leaping
from
his
ever-burning
forge.
He
was
filled
with
pride

One
day,
Blomgrun
was
commissioned
to
create
a
glorious
helm
for
a
Demacian
general.
Word
of
the
charge
was
leaked
to
the
Noxian
High
Command,
and
two
of
their
best
spies
ambushed
Blomgrun's
caravan
en
route.
Though
Poppy
escaped
with
the
helm,
she
helplessly
watched
as
her
father
was
slain.
Instead
of
fleeing

she
carried
the
