Inactivity
Due
to
certain
FireFox
update,
my
great-grandpa
laptop
can
no
longer
use
it...
and
opening
any
page
in
my
Safari
gives
it
a
"slow
script"
which
attempts
murder
me
with
lagness.
So...
I
wouldn't
be
as
active
as
I
can.
Whichever
the
case,
I'll
be
in
chat
fairly
often.
Do
something
and
I'll
kick
yo
ass
even
if
it
risk
being
murdered
by
the
lagness.

I
am...
SEA
player,
also
currently
an
editor
working
to
diminish
vandals
on
odd
timing
whenever
I
can.
If
you
are
looking
for
me
from
Garena
LoL
Forum
,
either
check
the
live
chat
for
my
presence,
or
leave
a
message
on
my
talk
page.
IGN

Real
name?
Lorenzo,
and
I'm
a
Singapore/Malaysia
oriented
Chinese.
I
live
in
Singapore,

a
guy
in
his
twenties,
working
as
a
usual
not-highly
paid
dude...
but
I
like
LoL.
That's
it.
:)
Playing
style?
I'm
extremely
offensive
player
if
circumstances
allow
me
to,
especially
when
I'm
playing
the
Qammer
,
be
it
solo
top
or
duo
bot
as
carry.
I
like
being
the
support
role
too,
but
that
is
only
when
I
have
a
trusted
carry
lane-mate.
My
trusted
mates
on
LoL:
Kepily,
lordmayii
,
sainity,
tigger.
Many
more
that
I
did
not
mention
here,
but
I
like
playing
with
some
of
them
too,
provided
they
don't
QQ
bout
every
single
thing
in
the
game.
