Trivia
Swain
was
designed
by
Coronach
.
Swain
was
the
first
champion
to
be
announced
and
then
reworked
before
he
went
live.
As
shown
in
his
Champion
Spotlight
,
Torment's
damage
over
time
was
increased
by
the
amount
of
damage
taken
in
its
duration.
Nevermove
is
a
reference
to
the
narrative
poem
The
Raven
,
by
Edgar
Allan
Poe
.
According
to
Phreak
,
Swain's
Nevermove
ability
was
originally
supposed
to
be
called
Nevermore
and
was
called
Nevermove
as
a
pun.
When
the
ability
was
implemented
in
the
game
the
name
was
not
changed
back.
Swain's
raven
is
named
Beatrice.
[1]
When
Swain
dies,
Beatrice
flies
off
the
screen.
Beatrice
can
be
seen
on
the
Crystal
Scar
.
She
will
land
on
the
barrier
near
the
Boneyard
node
for
a
short
time
and
then
fly
off.
Interestingly,
if
Swain
dies
while
casting
Decrepify
,
there
will
be
two
Beatrices
on
the
battlefield,
one
attached
to
the
laser
and
one
on
his
back
when
he
falls
to
the
ground.
Swain's
Ravenous
Flock
transformation
has
a
similar
appearance
to
Tzeentch's
daemon
servants,
the
Lords
of
Change
,
from
the
Warhammer
franchise.
The
ending
quote
to
Swain's
background
is
based
on
Joseph
Heller's
novel
Catch-22
.
Based
on
the
lore,
Swain
was
unable
to
compete
in
the
Ionia
Versus
Noxus
Grudge
Match
due
to
recently
becoming
a
member
of
the
Noxian
High
Command,
thus
needing
to
take
time
away
from
the
League
to
put
all
his
affairs
in
order.
Swain
is
the
second
champion
to
feature
a
transformation
ability,
the
others
being
Nidalee
,
Shyvana
,
Zyra
,
Jayce
and
Elise
.
The
icon
for
Swain's
Ravenous
Flock
is
similar
to
the
icon
for
Vladimir's
Tides
of
Blood.
Quotes
Swain's
quote,
"The
early
bird
guts
the
worm,"
is
based
off
of
a
famous
idiom,
"The
early
bird
gets
the
worm."
While
Ravenous
Flock
is
active,
Swain
has
three
separate
/jokes
and
an
additional
/taunt,
unlike
other
champions
with
"true
forms".
In
polish
client,
selection
quote
is
"Rozdziobią
was
kruki,
wrony"
(You
gonna
be
pecked
out
by
crows
and
ravens),
which
is
a
reference
to
Stefan
Żeromski's
1895
novel
of
the
same
title.
Skins
The
color
of
Swain's
form
in
Ravenous
Flock
changes
with
different
skins.
Classic
Swain
is
black,
Northern
Front
Swain
turns
white,
and
Bilgewater
Swain
turns
red,
and
Tyrant
Swain
is
blue,
with
clothes
and
a
staff.
In
addition,
Beatrice's
form
is
either
a
snowy
owl
or
a
parrot
in
Swain's
respective
skins.
Northern
Front
Swain
is
a
reference
to
the
Soviet
Northern
Front
,
a
major
military
organization
created
during
the
Second
World
War
.
Bilgewater
Swain
is
likely
a
reference
to
Long
John
Silver
,
the
antagonist
of
the
novel
Treasure
Island
.
Tyrant
Swain
can
be
seen
in
the
left
of
Battle
Bunny
Riven's
Splash
Art.
It
is
also
seen
during
the
coronation
scene.
This
skin
thus
depicts
Swain
after
his
rise
to
Grand
General,
the
highest
position
of
power
in
Noxus.
This
is
also
the
only
skin
in
which
Swain
is
not
dependent
on
his
cane
to
walk;
he
instead
carries
a
staff.
Bilgewater
Swain's
Beatrice
is
a
scarlet
macaw.
In
the
American
splash
art
Beatrice's
flight
feathers
are
blue
and
green,
as
opposed
to
the
real
life
macaw's
blue
and
yellow
feathers,
however,
on
the
Chinese
splash
art
the
colors
are
just
like
the
real
life
parrots.
Bilgewater
Swain
is
seen
with
Beatrice
being
a
macaw,
however,
real
life
pirates
actually
had
Amazon
Parrots
as
pets,
as
opposed
to
the
exotic
Macaw.
Relations
Swain
was
the
Grand
General,
and
now
leader
of
Noxus
,
one
of
Valoran's
most
powerful
city-states.
Swain
was
a
member
of
the
Black
Rose,
a
dark
and
mysterious
group
that
controlled
Noxus
before
the
rise
of
the
military
government.
They
were
thought
to
no
longer
exist.
However,
with
the
reemergence
of
their
leader
Leblanc,
the
Deceiver
,
the
Black
Rose
are
working
towards
getting
the
organization
back
into
power.
Swain
and
Jarvan
IV,
the
Exemplar
of
Demacia
,
have
a
deep,
hate-filled
rivalry.
He
has
attempted
to
kill
Jarvan
IV
on
several
occasions.
After
attending
one
of
Sona's
concerts,
he
stated:
"Her
melody
moves
the
soul,
her
silence
sunders
the
body."
During
the
War
of
Kalamanda
,
Garen
and
his
Dauntless
Vanguard
hindered
the
progress
of
Swain
and
his
army's
advancement
at
every
turn.
Swain
has
formed
an
alliance
with
Darius,
the
Hand
of
Noxus
,
and
they
worked
together
to
unite
the
nation
behind
a
vision
of
true
Noxian
strength.
Swain
possibly
knows
the
reason
for
the
mysterious
disappearance
of
Katarina's
father.
