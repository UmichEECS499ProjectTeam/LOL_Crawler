The
image
of
the
Tribunal
given
when
it
was
first
announced.
The
Tribunal
is
a
system
introduced
in
May
2011
by
Riot
Games
to
help
discipline
players
and
keep
the
community
in
check
with
the
help
of
their
peers.

What
it
does
When
a
summoner
logs
in
to
the
Tribunal,
s/he
is
assigned
a
case
to
review.
Each
case
involves
a
summoner
who
has
been
reported
for
any
number
of
reasons
on
multiple
occasions.
The
summoner
reviewing
the
case
is
given
chat
logs,
game
statistics,
and
report
details
to
help
them
decide
if
the
offending
summoner
should
be
punished
or
pardoned
.
A
summoner
can
also
skip
a
case
if
they
are
unsure
or
uncomfortable
choosing
a
verdict.
The
Tribunal
does
not
judge
afk
/
leaves
however.
These
cases
are
handled
by
the
"LeaverBuster".
Justice
Review
All
the
cases
judged
or
skipped,
the
end
result,
and
how
unanimous
the
decision
was
can
be
viewed
in
the
Justice
Review
.
Additionally,
a
case
can
be
revisited
to
see
the
resulting
punishment
assigned
to
the
offender
(permaban,
time
ban,
warning,
pardon).
The
Justice
Review
also
shows
a
summoner's:
total
number
of
cases
reviewed,
cases
correctly
judged
(vote
agreed
with
the
majority),
longest
correct
judgement
streak,
and
ranking
and
justice
rating
.
Summoners
can
also
see
how
many
toxic
days
they
have
prevented
and
how
many
players
have
been
perma-banned
from
cases
they
voted
on.
Justice
Rating
Summoners
that
vote
on
cases
in
the
tribunal
develop
a
justice
rating
which
is
calculated
using
their
score
and
their
right/wrong
judging
percentage.
A
summoner's
score
is
increased
when
their
vote
agrees
with
the
majority
verdict.
Currently,
there
are
no
rewards
for
obtaining
a
good
justice
rating.
Who
can
participate
Any
summoner
that
is
level
20
(Formerly
30)
who
isn't
currently
banned
can
participate
in
reviewing
Tribunal
cases.
A
summoner
can
review
up
to
20
cases
a
day.
Summoners
receive
a
Justice
Rating
based
on
how
often
their
votes
coincide
with
the
majority
vote
on
cases.
On
the
contrary,
if
a
player
repeatedly
votes
against
the
majority,
they
will
lose
the
access
to
the
Tribunal.
This
system
is
used
to
encourage
players
to
read
thoroughly
their
assigned
cases,
instead
of
blindly
punishing
people.
Punishable
offenses
The
following
actions
are
violations
of
the
Summoner's
Code
and
considered
punishable
offences:
Explicit
use
of
hate
terms,
racial
slurs,
cultural
epithets,
etc.
Players
who
deliberately
and
viciously
insult
other
players.
Repeatedly
negative,
nonconstructive
attitudes.
Players
whose
teasing
crosses
the
line,
and
who
persist
after
being
asked
repeatedly
to
stop.
Deliberately
disruptive
gameplay,
such
as
intentional
feeding
or
otherwise
assisting
the
enemy
team.
Offensive
summoner
names.
Honor
trading.
It
is
important
to
note
that
occasionally
having
bad
games
is
not
considered
a
punishable
offense,
but
it
is
possible
to
receive
suspensions
if
deemed
appropriate
by
a
riot
customer
service
representative
as
stated
in
the
Tribunal
FAQ.
Punishments
When
a
summoner's
case
receives
a
certain
number
of
"punish"
votes
(a
number
not
divulged
by
Riot),
they
receive
a
punishment
intending
to
deter
this
behavior
from
happening
again.
Possible
punishments
include
a
warning,
suspension,
name
change,
or
in
severe
cases,
permanent
banning.
The
Tribunal
automatically
assigns
some
low-level
penalties
to
players,
such
as
e-mail
warnings.
More
severe
cases,
however,
are
reviewed
and
assigned
punishments
manually
by
Player
Support.
Punishment
is
not
influenced
in
any
way
by
the
number
of
votes.
Under
special
circumstances,
Riot
Games
can
even
veto
the
verdict
of
the
Tribunal.

Lyte
and
Pendragon.
On

Riot
released
the
following
Tribunal

Over
50%
of
all

never

of
players
who
receive
enough

to
face
the
tribunal
are
punished

the

total

Over
80,000,000

Tribunal
Mechanics
The
Tribunal
cannot
issue
permanent
bans.
When
a
player
accumulates
enough
temporary
suspensions
(a
minimum
of
five
times,
unless
specially
escalated
by
Player
Behavior
specialists[
[2]
]),
the
system
flags
accounts
for
manual
review
by
Player
Support
teams,
which
reviews
the
player's
behavior
and
determines
if
a
permanent
ban
is
warranted.
[3]
Permanent
bans
are
not
based
on
the
severity
of
the
offenses,
but
rather
on
the
possibility
of
the
players
improving
their
behavior.
[4]
In
the
online
Tribunal
case
review,
a
random
sampling
of
games
in
which
the
subject
player
has
been
reported
is
displayed.
[5]
It
takes
hundreds
of
reports
over
dozens
of
games
for
a
player
to
end
up
in
the
Tribunal.
Not
all
games
are
displayed
for
Tribunal
judges.
[6]
The
average
player
has
20-40
reports
per
2000
games.
[7]
Ratio
of
games
to
reports
is
included
in
the
formula
that
determines
if
a
player
ends
up
in
the
Tribunal.
[8]
If
a
player
is
suspended
by
the
Tribunal,
cases
that
occurred
before
the
suspension
are
no
longer
counted
for
purposes
of
sending
the
player
to
the
Tribunal
again.
[9]
[10]
Players
who
receive
a
warning
from
the
Tribunal
have
their
honor
scores
reset
and
their
honor
badges
removed.
[11]
[12]
There
is
a
method
to
discourage
voters
from
spamming
the
Punish
button.
[13]
Players
who
are
repeatedly
sent
to
the
Tribunal,
but
are
pardoned,
have
their
accounts
flagged
for
manual
review.
Rioters
that
review
cases
have
access
to
more
information
than
Tribunal
judges,
such
as
pre
and
post
game
chat
logs.
[14]
Players
who
have
been
punished
will
have
their
'Ban
level'
go
down
over
time
if
they
do
not
incur
further
infractions.
[15]
Players
who
frequently
and
inaccurately
report
other
players
will
eventually
no
longer
have
their
reports
count
toward
sending
others
to
the
Tribunal.
[16]
Planned
Features
A
number
of
features
have
been
planned
in
the
future
to
enhance
the
Tribunal
system.
Inclusion
of
pre
and
post
game
chat
(such
as
the
champion
select
and
victory/defeat
screens)
Inclusion
of
whether
players
in
the
game
were
a
part
of
a
premade
group
or
not.
At
some
point
in
the
future,
people
may
also
be
given
rewards
depending
on
their
Justice
Rating.
