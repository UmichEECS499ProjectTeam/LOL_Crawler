Contagion
Warning
at
the
Institute
Precautionary
measures
taken
Quinton
Groat
reporting
from
the
Institute
of
War
Akali
,
volunteering
as
a
nurse,
prepares
to
administer
a
mandatory
shot
to
Amumu
.
All
staff,
including
champions
and
summoners
,
were
briefly
evacuated
from
the
Institute
of
War
today
when
trace
amounts
of
a
synthetic
arcane
disease
were
detected
in
the
Luminary
Cloister.
Adjudicators
were
alerted
to
the
danger
of
a
foreign
presence
when
magical
seals
surrounding
the
Cloister
were
tripped
during
off-hours
yesterday
afternoon.
“The
Luminary
Cloister
is
one
of
the
most
hallowed
sections
of
the
Institute.”
Kayle
explained,
“Like
most
sensitive
areas,
its
perimeter
is
enchanted
with
protective
seals
which
ward
against
uninvited
entities.
I
arrived
less
than
a
minute
after
the
initial
alarm
pulse
but
when
I
reached
the
Cloister,
the
room
was
entirely
empty…or
so
it
seemed.”
It
turned
out
the
seals
were
disrupted
when
a
virulent
magical
contagion
crossed
their
threshold.
The
disease
appears
to
have
been
specially
manufactured
to
be
light
enough
to
bypass
most
security
measures,
but
the
seals
this
deep
in
the
Institute
are
forged
with
secrets
of
truly
ancient
sorcery.
In
the
entire
room,
there
was
less
of
the
disease
discovered
than
what
you
might
find
in
the
tip
of
a
quill,
but
by
the
time
additional
support
arrived,
Kayle
was
already
aware
that
something
was
wrong.
“I
was
suddenly
extremely
energetic.
I
was
flapping
my
wings
furiously.
It
felt
imperative
to
move.”
Kayle’s
anatomy
responded
differently
to
the
disease
than
a
Runeterran
’s
would.
Instead
of
attacking
her
organs
on
a
cellular
level,
the
disease
agitated
her
antibodies
into
a
near
frenzy
state.
They
in
turn
surged
throughout
her
body,
hunting
the
invading
strain
and
processing
it
into
digestible
nutrients.
Corfaiel
Dithins,
Professor
of
Microconjury,
isolated
the
contagion
from
samples
taken
from
the
room.
“This
handiwork
is
flawless.
It
takes
quite
a
bit
of
finesse
to
maintain
such
artful
control
of
magic
on
this
minute
scale.
There
are
only
a
handful
of
mages
who
could
manage
something
this
exquisite,
although
I
can’t
imagine
any
one
of
them
perpetrating
such
a
crime.”
While
the
League
continues
its
inquiry
into
the
unusual
outbreak,
mandatory
inoculations
have
been
issued
to
all
citizens
present
or
arriving
at
the
Institute.
Dithins
and
his
colleagues
conjured
a
vaccine
using
Kayle’s
blood
which
doctors
and
volunteers
have
been
using
nonstop
to
immunize
all
personnel.
The
reaction
for
humans
coming
in
contact
with
the
disease
won’t
be
quite
the
same
as
it
was
for
Kayle;
they
should
succumb
to
an
unpleasant
but
bearable
illness
while
their
bodies
battle
off
the
disease.
The
disease
warning
has
been
lifted,
and
League
officials
are
confident
the
situation
has
been
contained.
They
predict
returning
to
“the
usual
routine”
by
late
tomorrow
evening.
Mysterious
Fires
Plague
Demacian
Coast
League
officials
investigating
possibility
of
rogue
magic
use
Henril
Dreving
reporting
from
Andras
A
slew
of
fires
cropped
up
along
the
western
coast
of
Valoran
this
week,
beginning
at
the
small
Demacian
coastal
settlement
of
Andras
and
spreading
south
into
the
forests
of
the
Great
Barrier.
While
Demacian
forces
assist
in
containment
of
these
mysterious
fires,
the
Institute
of
War
has
dispatched
a
group
of
officials
to
oversee
the
proceedings
on
suspicion
of
unauthorized
use
of
magic.
Settlers
of
Andras,
a
quiet
settlement
situated
on
a
small
bluff
overlooking
the
Conqueror’s
Sea,
reportedly
awoke
early
yesterday
morning
to
shouts
and
the
scent
of
smoke.
The
fire
originated
at
Andras’
Council
House
at
the
bluff’s
edge
and
quickly
began
to
spread—luckily,
the
House
was
empty
in
the
dead
of
night
and
no
lives
were
lost.
The
source
of
the
fire
remains
unknown,
though
the
first
villager
on
the
scene
offered
this
report:
“The
flames
came
up
from
down
the
bluff
before
the
Council
House
caught
fire.
When
I
looked
over
the
edge,
there
was
something—or
someone
—down
there,
engulfed
in
flame!
I
hardly
got
a
good
look
at
him
before
he
disappeared
in
a
blaze
down
the
shoreline.”
This
sighting
has
not
been
otherwise
confirmed.
Settlers
who
fought
back
the
fire
also
reported
its
frightening
resistance
to
efforts
to
quell
it.
“The
fire
spread
faster
than
any
natural
fire
I’ve
ever
seen,”
said
one
wary
councilwoman.
“It
wanted
to
consume
everything
in
its
path.
There’s
magic
at
work
here.”
As
the
Institute
of
War
received
reports
of
similar
instances
in
neighboring
coastal
settlements
over
the
following
days,
League
representatives
responded
to
detection
of
a
high
amount
of
magical
energy
in
the
same
region.
League
Representative
Mycroft
Zimmer
and
a
small
group
of
summoners
arrived
in
Andras
and
spread
along
the
other
coastal
settlements
to
provide
a
close
monitoring
of
the
situation
as
it
develops.
“The
Institute
of
War
has
reason
to
believe
that
the
culprit
behind
these
fires
is
utilizing
unauthorized
magic,”
Zimmer
stated.
“While
we
do
not
yet
know
what
we
are
facing,
the
Institute
of
War
does
not
tolerate
reckless
use
of
power.
If
this
is
the
work
of
a
rogue
mage,
the
perpetrator
will
be
dealt
with
appropriately.”
The
fires
follow
a
strange
and
sudden
increase
in
coastal
temperatures
measured
over
the
past
few
days.
While
wildfires
and
odd
weather
aren’t
entirely
unheard
of
in
the
region,
even
along
the
coast,
most
instances
occur
during
the
dry
months
and
remain
isolated
to
the
Great
Barrier
forests.
Not
all
of
the
Institute’s
representatives
share
Zimmer’s
conviction,
however.
“It’s
strange,
but
not
unusual,”
said
Runaan
Eversky,
a
summoner
under
Zimmer’s
watch.
“We
must
be
careful,
but
it
could
be
anything.
We’ve
had
strange
magical
weather
before.
This
is
Runeterra,
after
all.”
The
Horseshoe
Heist
Bandle
City
horses
discovered
short
a
shoe
Quinton
Groat
reporting
from
Bandle
City
Sunday
morning,
Bandle
City
horse
owners
were
alarmed
to
discover
that
several
of
their
horses
were
inexplicably
missing
horseshoes.
Residents
became
aware
of
the
issue
when
Bampo
Tunker,
a
local
stable
owner,
reached
out
to
nearby
farm
owners
for
information
about
the
suspected
theft
or
prank.
Hours
later,
a
joint
investigation
conducted
by
Bandle
City
authorities
and
the
Mothership
Equine
Society
revealed
that
nearly
every
horse
in
the
region
suddenly
lacked
its
left-front
horseshoe.
Locals
are
calling
it
the
“Horseshoe
Heist”.
“It’s
the
darnedest
thing,”
Tunker
commented,
“I
noticed
one
of
my
stock
was
missing
a
shoe
first
thing
in
the
morning.
That
kind
of
thing
happens
all
the
time
so
I
replaced
it
without
a
thought.
I
rode
out
with
Fripple,
one
of
my
hands,
for
our
morning
rounds,
and
Ol’
Breesa
got
spooked
and
threw
me!
First
time
ever!
I
looked
back
to
Fripple
and
his
horse
was
spooked,
and
he
was
layin’
in
the
mud
right
behind
me!”
Experts
are
puzzled,
to
say
the
least.
“This
is
perplexing,”
confessed
Dalilah
Frommin,
spokesyordle
for
the
Equine
Society.
“It
would
take
an
awful
lot
of
effort
to
remove
a
shoe
from
so
many
horses
in
one
night,
let
alone
without
anyone
noticing.
And
why?
Horseshoes
generally
they
aren’t
that
valuable.
And
if
you
were
going
to
steal
them
for
profit…well,
I’d
think
you’d
want
to
take
all
four.”
For
most
horse
owners,
the
oddness
of
the
situation
has
preempted
their
frustrations.
Tunker
chose
to
take
it
as
motivation.
“Well,
at
first
I
was
pretty
riled
up,
but
when
I
thought
about
it,
enough
of
the
herd
was
overdue
for
a
new
set
that
this
might
just
have
been
a
much-needed
kick
in
the
pants.”
Estimated
losses
were
low,
but
Mayor
Dennison
Jadefellow
organized
an
outdoor
charity
banquet
to
raise
funds
for
Horseshoe
Heist
victims.
The
banquet
was
a
smash
success,
as
hundreds
of
Bandle
City
residents,
including
League
champions
Teemo
and
Tristana
,
came
out
to
support
local
horse
owners
and
discuss
the
peculiar
occasion.
Officials
reported
that
they
actually
received
quite
a
bit
more
in
donations
than
was
necessary
to
replace
the
horseshoes,
and
they
are
currently
deliberating
how
to
invest
the
additional
funds.
They
are
also
considering
making
the
“Horseshoe
Banquet”
a
regular
annual
event
as,
in
the
end,
it
has
been
viewed
as
a
great
source
of
amusement.
Jadefellow
commented,
“Whoever
the
mastermind
behind
this
evil
was,
he
has
a
lot
new
fans
in
Bandle
City.”

The
Editor-in-Chief
answers
Valoran’s
most
pressing
questions!
Senior
Summoner
Ralston
Farnsley
commenting
from
the
Institute
of
War
The
recent
addition
of
the
Blind
Monk
to
the
League
is
inspiring.
His
level
of
commitment
and
dedication
to
the
betterment
of
the
world
is
something
we
should
all
aspire
to.
I
salute
him,
and
look
forward
to
seeing
the
impact
he
can
have
as
a
champion
of
the
League
of
Legends.
“I
pen
my
question
to
you
in
response
to
a
recent
letter
in
the
Journal.
In
your
response
to
"Where
can
I
summon
my
champions
from?"
The
Journal
stated:
"...summoning
creatures
or
people
from
other
planets
or
against
their
will
is
expressly
forbidden,
except
in
some
very
special
circumstances
approved
by
the
League."
“So
the
League
has
the
right
to
pull
a
creature
from
its
world
against
its
will?
How
can
we
trust
a
League
that
is
up
for
kidnapping,
special
circumstances
or
not.”
–
Summoner
Mizuki
Your
question
is
well-received.
It
is
the
duty
of
all
citizens
to
ask
questions
like
these
of
their
governments
and
leaders
in
order
to
keep
the
powers
in
check.
I
think
one
of
the
major
reasons
this
is
in
the
forefront
of
some
minds
is
because
of
the
recent
induction
of
Nocturne
to
the
League.
A
confessed
(and
proud)
murderer
of
summoners,
there
was
quite
a
bit
of
controversy
surrounding
what
to
do
with
him
when
he
emerged
and
was
captured
in
our
world.
There
was
a
particularly
fierce
debate
over
whether
he
should
be
exterminated
immediately
for
his
crimes
and
to
prevent
further
threat,
or
whether
he
should
be
kept
alive
and
examined
in
order
to
better
understand
the
dream
plane.
After
great
deliberation,
it
was
decided
that
he
should
pay
for
his
crimes
on
the
Fields
of
Justice
.
The
League
pledged
the
wealth
which
would
normally
be
accorded
to
him
as
a
champion
instead
to
the
families
of
his
victims.
He
will
literally
pay.
At
the
same
time,
he
will
be
neither
executed
nor
made
a
lab
rat.
Regardless
of
which
decision
you
agree
with,
they
did
put
some
consideration
into
the
issue.
I
have
to
admit,
I
agree
with
their
decision.
“I
have
a
question
about
the
remaining
two
survivors
that
made
it
back
with
Jarvan
IV
from
their
great
two
year
journey,
who
are
they?
What
shape
are
they
in
now
after
this
adventure?”
–
lil
westy
The
two
soldiers
who
returned
with
Jarvan
never
uttered
a
word
about
the
journey.
It
is
unknown
how
much
information
has
even
been
disclosed
to
the
Royal
Family,
as
rumor
has
it
that
Jarvan
himself
hasn’t
spoken
of
the
trip
with
even
his
closest
friends.
I
managed
to
discover
that
one
of
the
men
was
granted
“indefinite
leave”
and
currently
resides
at
Demacia’s
Fairweather
Retreat,
a
resort
well-known
for
aiding
soldiers
plagued
by
the
trauma
of
battle.
The
other
soldier
seems
to
have
completely
vanished.
“Question
for
Cassiopeia
:
Since
your
introduction
to
the
League,
you
have,
in
my
opinion,
been
one
of
the
best
and
most
underrated
champions
available
for
summoning.
I
am
confused
as
to
why
you
haven't
had
any
attention
since
your
initiation,
and
what
you
have
been
keeping
yourself
busy
with
since?”
–
Summoner
AngryPeanut
As
someone
who
knew
Cassiopeia
before
and
after
the…incident,
I
have
to
say
it
saddens
me
deeply
(and
unsettles
me
thoroughly)
to
see
her
slithering
down
the
corridors
of
the
Institute.
Don’t
let
it
be
said
that
I
don’t
go
the
extra
mile
for
you,
our
readers.
“Why
haven’t
I
had
attention?!
You
are
more
cruel
than
angry,
Peanut.
In
case
you
haven’t
noticed,
I
am
not
exactly
the
flower
I
once
was.
I
appreciate
your
summons,
and
am
pleased
to
have
served
you
well,
but
my
life
will
forever
more
be
one
of
reclusion.
If
you
suddenly
woke
to
find
yourself
molting,
you
might
understand.
As
for
how
I
“keep
myself
busy,”
I
spend
my
ample
free
time
looking
into
the
sudden
and
mysterious
disappearance
of
a
loved
one,
and
the
promise
of
vengeance
when
I
discover
those
responsible."
