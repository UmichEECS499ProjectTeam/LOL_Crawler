The
triggering

apply
life
steal.
The
bonus
damage
from
Staggering
Blow
will
benefit
from
critical
strikes.
The
bonus
damage
does
not
affect
structures.
PENDING
FOR
TEST
Staggering
Blow's
relationship
with
dodge
,
parry
,
block
and
blind
has
yet
to
be
tested.

Active:
Nautilus
hurls
his
anchor
forward
in
a
line.
If
it
hits
an
enemy
unit,
Nautilus
drags
himself
and
the
unit
together,
dealing
magic
damage
and
briefly
stunning
the
enemy.
If
the
anchor
hits
terrain,

will
drag
himself
forward
and
the
cooldown
is

Ability
Details
Dredge
Line
is
a
colliding
linear
skill
shot
.
Projectile
speed:
2000
Applies
spell
effects
as
a
single
target
ability.
Spell
vamp
is
fully
applied.
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
will
apply
a
35%
slow.
Magic
damage
will
be
mitigated
by
Black
Shield
and
Lifeline
.
Spell
shields
will
block
the
damage
and
pull
but
will
not
prevent
Nautilus
from
pulling
himself
partway
to
the
target.
Additional
Information:
Despite
having
a
cast
time,
Dredge
Line
will
preserve
Nautilus'
previous
movement
orders
if
the
dash
direction
is
roughly
along
the
path
he
is
scheduled
to
take.
This
is
a
convenience
change
meant
to
aid
Nautilus
if
he
is
using
the
ability
for
casual
travel.
Dredge
Line
will
ignore
player-created
terrain
such
as
Cataclysm
-
the
projectile
will
simply
pass
through
these
obstacles
and
will
pull
Nautilus
over
them
if
he
hits
a
valid
target
on
the
other
side.
If
an
enemy
unit
is
killed
with
Dredge
Line,
Nautilus
will
instead
pull
himself
all
the
way
to
their
location.
Titan's
Wrath
Cooldown:
18
Cost:
80
mana
Active:
Nautilus
gains
a
shield
that
absorbs
a
certain
amount
of
damage.
The
shield
dissipates
after
10
seconds
if
not
already
destroyed.
While
the
shield
persists,
Nautilus's
basic
attacks
are
enhanced
to
debuff
all
enemies
within
175
range
of
his
target,
dealing
bonus
magic
damage
over
2
seconds.
Titan's
Wrath
also
resets
Nautilus'
basic
attack
timer
when
first
used.

PENDING
FOR
TEST
Staggering
Blow's
relationship
with
dodge
,
parry
,
block
and
blind
has
yet
to
be
tested.
Magic
damage
will
be
mitigated
by
Black
Shield
and
Lifeline
.
Spell
shields
will
block
one
application
of
the
ability
only.
Further
applications
from
the
same
instance
of
Titan's
Wrath
will
not
be
blocked.
Additional
Information:
Titan's
Wrath
resets
Nautilus'
attack
timer
on
cast.
Titan's
Wrath
has
no
cast
time
and
does
not
interrupt
Nautilus'
previous
orders.
Titan's
Wrath
will
always
deal
half
of
the
stated
damage
of
the
damage
over
time
on-hit,
with
the
rest
of
the
damage
being
applied
over
the
next
second
regardless
of
how
fast
Nautilus
attacks.
When
activated,
Titan's
Wrath
causes
Nautilus
to
replace
his
standard
autoattacks
with
two
new
ones
linked
animation-wise.
Autoattacks
using
these
animations
will
always
apply
the
damage
over
time,
even
if
the
shield
expires
before
the
damage
has
been
applied.

Nautilus
slams
the
ground,
causing
the
earth
to
explode
around
him
in

to
enemies
in
the
area
and
slows
them
for
2
seconds.
This
slow
diminishes
over
time.
An

be
hit
by
more
than
one
explosion,

Details
Depth
Charge
is
a
targeted
area
of
effect
ability
that
sends
a
chasing
projectile
towards
a
target,
dealing
magic
damage
and
knocking
up
and
stunning
them
when

Additional
Information:

Charge's

speeds.
However,
a
target
moving
a
vast
distance
away
such
as
with
Recall
or
Teleport
will
cause
the
spell
to
fail
and
the
projectile
to
vanish.
