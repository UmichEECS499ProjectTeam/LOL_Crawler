Trivia
Vladimir
was
designed
by
Colt
'Ezreal'
Hallam
.
Vladimir
is
voiced
by
Kevin
M.
Connolly
.
One
of
Vladimir's
basic
abilties,
Tides
of
Blood,
is
a
reference
to
a
previous
Multiplayer
Online
Battle
Arena(MOBA)
game
by
the
same
name
that
was
created
as
a
custom
map
on
Warcraft
3.
Vladimir's
name
is
inspired
from
Vlad
the
Impaler
,
the
15th
century
wallachian
Prince
that
later
inspired
Bram
Stoker's
Dracula
.
Vladimir
was
the
second
champion
released
in
Season
One
,
Xin
Zhao
being
the
first.
Vladimir
was
one
of
the
champions
chosen
for
the
Noxian
pool
available
during
the
Ionia
vs.
Noxus
match
.
He
was
one
of
the
selected
champions.
According
to
Vladimir
himself
in
the
Journal
of
Justice
,
he
does
not
directly
drink
blood,
instead
directly
draining
the
life
force
out
of
his
victims.
Vladimir
is
one
of
the
five
champions
who
use
health
as
a
primary
resource
for
casting
spells.
The
other
four
champions
are
Aatrox
,
Dr.
Mundo
,
Mordekaiser
and
Zac
.
Quotes
Many
of
Vladimir's
lines
are
plays
on
popular
lines
meant
to
reflect
his
vampiric
attributes,
such
as
"The
clot
thickens."
instead
of
"The
plot
thickens."
Vladimir's
joke
is
a
pun
on
the
blood
type
B-
and
the
phrase
"be
negative".
Vladimir's
quote
"My
cup
is
half
empty"
may
mean
that
he
is
a
pessimist
.
Blood
Lord
Vladimir's
quote
"Kneel
before
Vlad."
is
a
reference
to
General
Zod
,
a
prominent
villain
from
the
Superman
comics.
Skins
Count
Vladimir
is
in
reference
to
Count
Dracula
from
Bram
Stoker's
Dracula
.
Marquis
Vladimir
is
in
reference
to
Lestat
de
Lioncourt
,
the
vampire
from
Anne
Rice's
The
Vampire
Chronicles
.
Nosferatu
Vladimir
is
in
a
reference
to
the
1922
movie
Nosferatu
,
the
very
first
vampire
motion
picture
ever
made.
Vandal
Vladimir's
Chinese
Splash
Art
shows
both
Brand
and
Gragas
on
the
other
motorcycles
behind
him.
In
the
American
splash
art,
both
Gragas
and
Brand
are
obscured,
keeping
them
previously
anonymous.
