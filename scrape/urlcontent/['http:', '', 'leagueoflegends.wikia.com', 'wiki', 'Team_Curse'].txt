Bio
Curse
Gaming
had
a
little
trouble
finding
its
footing
starting
off
as
a
team
in
League
of
Legends
eSports,
mostly
due
to
difficulty
with
findings
its
lineup.
Former
members
of
unRestricted
in
2011
became
the
starting
roster
of
Curse
Gaming,
which
consisted
of
LiQuiD112
,
DontMashMe
,
Doublelift
,
SYDTKO
,
Pobelter
,
Lapaka
,
Nyjacky
,
and
Jsura
.
Yet
Lakapaka,
Jsura,
DontMashMe,
and
Doublelift,
don't
stay
very
long.
In
October
Crumbzz
joins
the
team,
and
in
December
so
does
Cop
.
January
2012
starts
off
with
Curse
Gaming
getting
its
sponsor,
TeamSpeak.
In
May
SYDTKO
and
Crubzz
leave
with
the
replacement
of
Saintvicious
.
And
next
month
Westrice
comes
on
board
to
replace
Pobelter,
who
at
the
time
was
too
young
to
move
to
a
gaming
house.
Now
with
a,
more
or
less,
solidified
roster
Curse
Gaming
attends
the
IPL
Face
Off:
San
Francisco
Showdown
in
August.
They
get
defeated
by
Team
Solomid
,
but
place
2nd
in
their
first
Major
tournament.
Curse
then
went
on
to
compete
in
the
Season
2
World
Championship
Qualifier
in
Seattle.
Yet
their
hope
to
qualify
in
the
Championship
were
crushed
by
Counter
logic
gaming
in
the
3rd
place
match.
Afterward
Curse
Gaming
underwent
more
roster
alterations
as
they
acquire
their
members
-
Voyboy
and
Rhux
in
November,
but
lose
Westrice
in
December.
In
the
beginning
months
of
2013
Hai
,
SwainGretzky
and
OneBadBrad
also
join
Curse
Gaming
as
subs.
