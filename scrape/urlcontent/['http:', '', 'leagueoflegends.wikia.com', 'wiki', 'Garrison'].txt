Example
Garrison
is
a
summoner
spell
in
League
of
Legends
exclusively
available
to
the
Dominion
game
mode.
It
has
two
opposite
effects,
depends
on
the
casting
target.
Strategy
Save
Garrison
for
the
partially
neutralized
allied
capture
point
rather
than
a
"healthy"
one
to
take
advantage
of
its
regeneration
function.
Garrison
can't
be
cast
on
neutral
turrets
Garrison
will
interrupt
all
enemy
champion
from
capturing
a
point
,
with
it's
long
range
,
it's
useful
to
get
just
the
time
to
save
the
point.
When
using
Garrison
on
the
enemy
capture
point,
all
players
should
focus
on
defeating
the
enemy
champion.
Because
if
the
player
starts
neutralizing
the
capture
point,
it
will
stop
attacking,
defeating
the
purpose
to
activate
the
spell.
Casting
Garrison
on
the
capture
point
that
is
already
under
the
effect
of
another
one's
Garrison
(regardless
of
which
side)
will
overwrite
the
previous
one.
Try
to
avoid
casting
it
by
more
than
one
ally
before
its
effect
fades.
The
negative
effect
of
Garrison
on
enemy
capture
point
is
aesthetically
indicated
by
a
stream
of
pink
halos
descending
on
top
of
the
center
of
the
capture
point.
Garrison
on
allied
capture
point
is
ineffective
when
you
are
severely
outnumbered.
Because
the
opponents
can
have
one
champion
to
start
neutralizing
(disarming
the
turret
function
in
the
same
time)
while
the
others
to
attack
the
lone
defending
champion.
In
such
condition,
it
is
preferably
to
cast
some
safe
harassment
and
retreat
immediately
instead
of
defending
and
wasting
the
Garrison
on
it.
Trivia
Although
Garrison
substituted
Fortify
in
the
Dominion
mode
(prior
to
the
latter's
removal)
and
shares
a
similar
icon
design,
it
does
not
have
a
global
range
and
can
only
affect
one,
rather
than
all
structures
in
the
battlefield.
