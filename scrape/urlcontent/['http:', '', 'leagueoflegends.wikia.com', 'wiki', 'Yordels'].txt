Lore
Bandle
City
resides
in
Yordle
Land
and
is
the
home
city
of
the
yordle
race.
The
vast
majority
of
the
yordle
society
dwells
in
the
southeastern
part
of
Valoran,
behind
the
safety
of
the
Sablestone
Mountain
range.
Centuries
before,
the
yordles
were
a
nomadic
race,
traveling
around
the
continent
for
many
years.
They
eventually
settled
themselves
within
the
Ruddynip
Valley
where
modern
day
Bandle
City
is
now
located.
While
their
society
may
seem
like
a
simple
rural
community,
the
city
itself
holds
a
great
deal
of
intrigue
and
mystery.
Yordles
As
with
humans,
yordles
are
bipedal
sentient
beings.
They
also
have
male
and
female
genders.
Yordles
are
decidedly
shorter
than
humans;
both
male
and
female
yordles
rarely
exceed
1
meter
tall,
with
most
averaging
around
0.8
meters.
Their
skin
texture
ranges
from
being
completely
smooth,
to
very
lightly
covered
in
fur,
to
ultimately
being
significantly
furry.
Their
skin
tone
runs
a
much
broader
spectrum
of
colors
than
their
human
counterparts;
while
there
is
no
direct
scientific
explanation
for
this,
some
consider
this
to
be
a
sign
of
the
yordles’
attunement
to
Runeterra’s
magical
nature;
it
may
be
note
worthy
to
state
female
Yordles
tend
to
have
smooth
skin
(commonly
blue),
while
their
male
counterparts
tend
to
be
furry.
They
generally
have
inferior
vision
in
the
normal
spectrum
of
light
than
humans.
Yordles
nevertheless
have
much
better
hearing
and
are
able
to
see
into
the
infrared
spectrum
of
light,
whereas
humans
cannot.
Furthermore,
they
are
commonly
characterized
by
their
dependence
on
language,
as
well
as
their
creation
and
utilization
of
complex
tools.
The
yordle
race
may
possibly
have
genetic
ties
to
the
sea
dwelling
race
in
which
Fizz,
the
Tidal
Trickster
,
is
derived
from,
though
scientific
evidence
of
a
common
ancestor
has
yet
to
be
found.
According
to
a
recognition
scan
made
by
Vel'koz,
The
Eye
of
the
Void
,
a
yordle's
physiology
appears
to
be
"99%
fur,
1%
glee."
Culture
Yordles
require
far
more
social
interaction
with
their
own
kind
than
humans
do.
They
generally
are
a
peaceful
and
amicable
race,
often
marked
with
streaks
of
joviality
and
light
prankishness;
their
moral
compass
is
most
often
pointed
toward
goodness
and
benevolence.
Their
desire
for
social
interaction
drives
them
toward
this
ethos,
as
the
mental
health
of
a
yordle
is
very
much
dependent
on
the
positive
company
he
or
she
keeps.
This
does
not
mean,
however,
that
they
are
incapable
of
cruelty
and
evil.
In
fact,
a
yordle
who
is
kept
in
isolation
for
too
long
–
especially
from
contact
with
other
yordles
–
runs
the
risk
of
becoming
withdrawn
and
sullen.
Some
who
already
are
centered
more
toward
malevolence
will
become
exceedingly
so
in
due
course.
These
yordles
will
often
twist
their
desire
for
social
interaction
into
a
desire
to
seek
out
others
to
inflict
pain
and
suffering
upon
them,
one
extreme
example
being
Veigar,
the
Tiny
Master
of
Evil
.
Government
Bandle
City
has
a
very
community-based
government
with
various
officials
overseeing
their
own
specific
areas.
The
city-state's
current
leader
is
Mayor
Dennison
Jadefellow.
Military
What
yordles
lack
in
stature,
they
make
up
for
with
their
armaments
and
their
industriousness.
The
city's
weapons
brigade
–
the
Megling
Commandos
–
are
something
of
a
legend
in
Bandle
City.
They
have
a
history
that
spans
centuries,
and
they
remain
the
oldest
yordle
military
unit
still
in
service.
They
are
renowned
for
their
courage
and
bravery,
as
well
as
their
deadliness
and
ruthlessness,
earning
them
a
reputation
as
the
most
respected
and
feared
of
all
warriors
from
the
city-state.
Legends
of
Megling,
the
valiant
founder
of
the
commandos,
are,
to
this
day,
whispered
throughout
Valoran.
It
was
these
legends
that
drew
Tristana,
the
Megling
Gunner
,
to
join
the
yordle
military
as
a
part
of
the
Megling
Commandos.
Within
the
city's
intelligence
team
–
the
Scouts
of
the
Mothership
–
the
yordle
Teemo,
the
Swift
Scout
,
is
regarded
to
be
the
group's
top
recon
specialist.
However,
to
those
who
know
of
his
true
exploits,
it
is
clear
that
Teemo
is
actually
something
else
–
the
most
unwaveringly
unrepentant
assassin
of
Bandle
City.
Whilst
he
enjoys
the
typical
level
of
community
and
companionship
inherent
to
all
yordles,
Teemo's
feelings
for
his
people
are
so
immoderately
strong
that
he
ofttimes
ventures
out
to
seek
out
the
foes
of
his
city
on
his
own.
When
he
finds
them,
and,
oh,
does
he
find
them,
Teemo
extinguishes
their
lives
with
a
rare
and
particularly
toxic
ajunta
poison
he
gathers
personally
from
the
nearby
jungles
of
Kumungu.
It
is
said
that
by
those
close
to
him
that
something
switches
off
in
Teemo
when
he
sets
to
work
laying
his
snares
and
traps,
so
that
fleeting
thoughts
of
the
lives
he
ends
do
not
burden
him.
The
aerial
squadron
–
the
Screaming
Yipsnakes
–
utilized
the
Reconnaissance
Operations
Front-Line
Copter,
an
air
assault
vehicle
which
has
now
come
to
replace
the
Light
Operations
Lander
as
the
backbone
of
the
Bandle
City
Expeditionary
Force.
Corki,
the
Daring
Bombardier
,
was
by
far
the
most
renowned
of
this
highly
active
group.
He
and
his
squadron
soared
over
the
skies
of
Valoran,
surveying
the
landscape
and
conducting
breathtaking
aerial
acrobatics
for
the
mesmerized
onlookers
below.
In
times
of
conflict,
the
squadron
led
daring
missions
which
would
loft
them
deep
behind
enemy
lines,
to
both
crystallize
their
intelligence
of
enemy
formations
and
deliver
needed
messages
through
hot
zones.
Relations
with
Demacia
Bandle
City
shares
a
relatively
good
relationship
with
the
city-state
of
Demacia
.
Acting
as
an
envoy
between
the
two
city-states
is
Poppy,
the
Iron
Ambassador
.
Relations
with
Bilgewater
Ties
between
Bandle
City
and
Bilgewater
have
always
been
a
little
tense,
mainly
due
to
the
occasional
pirate
assaults
on
yordle
vessels.
Relations
with
Piltover
Though
Piltover
is
a
Demacian
ally,
it's
worth
noting
the
special
connection
between
Bandle
City
and
Piltover.
Many
of
the
most
ingenious
minds
of
Bandle
city
go
to
attend
the
University
in
the
heart
of
Piltover
from
mechanical
masterminds
to
tinkering
exellency;
the
most
obvious
display
of
Yordle
power
in
Piltover
University
is
Heimerdinger,
the
Revered
Inventor
.
Piltover
has
gotten
the
attention
of
many
yordles
and
taken
attention
to
many
also
such
as
Rumble,
the
Mechanized
Menace
and
Ziggs,
the
Hexplosive
Expert
.
Military
weaponization
for
Bandle
City
is
largely
produced
in
Piltover;
examples
would
be
the
Yipsnakes
aircraft
and
the
cities
defensive
outpost
walls
and
turrets.
Relations
with
Ionia
Bandle
City
and
Ionia
appear
to
have
a
neutral
relationship,
as
there
is
very
little
association
between
the
two
city-states.
However,
the
possible
exception
to
this
neutrality
is
Kennen,
the
Heart
of
the
Tempest
.
Born
from
Bandle
City,
Kennen
possessed
boundless
energy
that
found
no
limits
and
was
matched
only
by
his
unnerving
speed.
His
astonishing
gifts
remained
unnoticed
until
he
ran
straight
up
the
great
outer
wall
of
the
Placidium
in
Ionia.
When
word
of
this
feat
reached
the
Kinkou
Order
,
Kennen
was
quickly
and
quietly
brought
for
an
audience.
He
found
that
the
role
of
the
Heart
of
the
Tempest
suited
him,
frenetically
delivering
both
the
word
and
the
punishments
of
the
Kinkou
across
the
realm.
While
Kennen's
position
in
the
Order
prevents
him
from
favoring
one
side
over
another,
he
appears
to
have
a
deep
affection
for
Ionia,
and
would
often
cheer
for
the
city-state
while
in
battle.
History
Yordle
Girl
Went
Missing
A
little
purple,
yordle
girl,
named
Lulu
,
went
missing
on
one
afternoon.
She
was
last
seen
in
the
town
square
where
some
of
the
other
yordle
children
said
that
the
girl
was
talking
to
a
large
firefly
that
was
stuck
inside
a
bird
house.
The
girl
pulled
it
out,
followed
it
and,
suddenly,
disappeared
into
thin
air.
People
say
that
the
children
must
have
faulty
vision,
but
with
the
recent
effects
of
the
Rune
Wars,
there's
no
telling
if
what
the
children
say
is
true
or
perhaps
something
more.
The
Bandle
City
Mothership
Above
the
city
center
sits
a
hulking,
unfinished
rocket
called
the
Mothership.
There
are
no
records
which
say
where
it
came
from,
though
oral
histories
declare
that
it
was
there
before
the
first
yordles
came
to
settle
the
Ruddynip
Valley.
The
ship
is
a
cultural
icon
for
yordles
across
Runeterra
and
their
society
is
unified
around
the
concept
of
"getting
it
ready,"
or
restoring
the
broken-down
structure
as
a
symbol
of
cooperation.
Unfortunately,
actual
cooperation
ends
with
several
unfinished
projects
littering
the
site,
and
ongoing
debate
over
what
should
be
done
next.
The
Iron
Ambassador
to
Demacia
Years
ago
the
famous
yordle
blacksmith
Blomgrun
was
commissioned
to
create
a
glorious
helm
for
a
Demacian
general.
Word
of
this
charge
was
leaked
to
the
Noxian
High
Command,
and
two
of
their
best
spies
ambushed
Blomgrun's
caravan
en
route
to
Demacia.
Blomgrun's
daughter,
who
was
traveling
with
him
at
the
time,
was
able
to
escape
with
the
helm.
She
watched
helplessly
as
her
father
was
slain
before
her
eyes.
Instead
of
fleeing
home,
she
carried
the
helm
to
Demacia
alone.
When
the
Demacian
general
saw
the
grim
determination
behind
the
tears
in
her
eyes,
the
general
requested
that
the
leadership
of
Bandle
City
make
her
the
yordle
ambassador
to
Demacia.
The
yordle
leaders
agreed
with
the
request,
appointing
Blomgrun's
daughter,
Poppy
,
the
liaison
between
Bandle
City
and
Demacia.
A
Cupcake
from
the
Mothership
One
day
a
local
tinker
named
Beardly
Kittle
discovered
a
fossilized
cupcake
that
had
been
expelled
out
from
the
Mothership.
During
this
time
witnesses
claimed
to
see
lights
flashing
across
the
ship
for
a
few
seconds.
Yordle
scientists
continue
to
investigate,
though
they
found
it
unlikely
that
the
Mothership
will
be
turning
on
again
anytime
soon.
Nevertheless,
the
discovery
has
awakened
unified
celebration
in
Bandle
City,
with
Mayor
Dennison
Jadefellow
declaring
a
city-state
holiday.
Poppy's
Anniversary
Day
Ruined
The
pirate
Tiresias
Ellington
and
his
crew
boarded
a
Bandle
City
ship
headed
to
Demacia
and
sacked
the
vessel
of
its
goods.
Though
Tristana
and
Teemo's
special
forces
were
able
to
apprehend
the
pirates,
they
could
not
salvage
the
cargo.
This
particular
shipment
was
on
its
way
to
a
celebration,
a
commemoration
to
Poppy's
appointment
to
service
as
envoy
between
Demacia
and
the
yordles.
Bandle
City
appealed
to
the
League
to
solicit
reparations
from
Bilgewater
for
the
loss
of
the
goods,
along
with
spoiling
their
anniversary
plans.
Bilgewater’s
stance
was
that
they
were
not
responsible
for
the
actions
of
a
few
independent
sailors.
Attempted
Abduction
of
the
Mothership
Teemo
takes
aim
as
the
Tiny
Master
of
Evil
attempts
a
daring
escape.
It
was
discovered
that
the
mastermind
behind
the
Horseshoe
Heist
and
Balloon
Burglary
was
none
other
than
Veigar,
the
Tiny
Master
of
Evil
.
He
planned
to
use
these
items
in
a
grand
attempt
to
abduct
Bandle
City’s
Mothership.
The
horseshoes’
shape
allowed
them
to
slip
perfectly
under
the
curved
metal
of
the
Mothership’s
nose
cone
and
his
enchanted
balloons
threatened
to
lift
the
Mothership
from
the
ground.
Veigar's
plan
was
foiled,
however,
when
a
flock
of
sharp-winged
thresher
geese
approached
from
the
west.
The
flock
of
predatory
birds
passed
above
the
Mothership
and
sliced
though
all
but
one
of
Veigar’s
enchanted
balloons,
deflating
them
immediately.
Faced
with
an
impending
and
accidental
defeat,
Veigar
tugged
the
final
balloon
free
of
its
horseshoe
and
began
to
rise
into
the
sky.
The
League
Champion
Teemo,
having
just
arrived
at
the
Mothership,
took
aim
and
burst
Veigar’s
last
balloon
with
a
single
dart.
The
Tiny
Master
of
Evil
plummeted
into
the
tree
line
just
outside
the
city.
Bandle
City
officials
were
unable
to
locate
the
Tiny
Master
of
Evil
following
his
escape
from
the
battle,
noting
that
it
is
likely
he
escaped
through
magical
means.
The
Mothership
miraculously
suffered
no
apparent
damage
from
the
incident.
Many
onlookers,
however,
commented
that
the
Mothership
appeared
to
have
shifted
slightly
to
the
left.
The
Lost
Girl
Returns
Lulu
playing
hide-and-seek
The
young,
purple,
yordle
girl,
Lulu
,
that
was
reportedly
missing
centuries
ago,
miraculously
reappeared,
and
although
she
did
grow,
she
was
much
younger
and
healthier
than
anticipated.
During
her
absence,
she
acquired
some
new
magical
talent
and
a
new
friend,
Pix
,
possibly
the
large
firefly
that
the
yordles
had
told
about.
Lulu
sought
to
reconnect
to
the
residents
of
Bandle
City,
but
her
attempt
had
unfortunate
results.
She
led
all
the
children
off
to
play
hide
and
seek,
temporarily
changing
them
into
flowers
and
animals
to
spice
up
the
game,
but
their
parents
didn’t
appreciate
her
efforts.
The
yordles
insisted
that
she
leave
their
lands
immediately
and
she
willingly
did
so.
She
later
went
to
the
League
of
Legends
to
see
if
she
could
reconnect
with
the
rest
of
Valoran
through
it.
