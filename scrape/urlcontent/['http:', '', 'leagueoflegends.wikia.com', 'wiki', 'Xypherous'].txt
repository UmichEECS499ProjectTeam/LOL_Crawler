Kuo's
foray
into
design
began
at
an
early
age,
where
he
forged
humble
ASCII
creations
from
archaic
systems
known
now
only
to
myth
and
legend.
Eventually,
he
pursued
more
noble
goals
such
as
the
craft
of
working
on
mods
that
never
see
the
light
of
day
though
he
assures
us
they
were
amazing.
Following
this,
he
pursued
computer
science
degree
at
UCLA,
doing
both
his
undergraduate
and
graduate
degrees
there.
His
gaming
background
mostly
includes
twitch
action,
single
player
immersion
games
as
well
as
the
fine
art
of
filling
bars
by
clicking
the
same
button
repeatedly.
Special
Ability

Logic
:
Once
a
day
when

effects
of
