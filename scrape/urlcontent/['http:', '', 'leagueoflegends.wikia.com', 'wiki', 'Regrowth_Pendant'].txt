Strategy
When
used
with
champions
with
a
passive
giving
health
regeneration,
like
Garen
,
or
Volibear
,
Regrowth
Pendant
could
allow
them
to
lane
for
an
extremely
long
time.
This
was
a
very
useful
item
as
it
allowed
your
champion
to
stay
in
lane
for
longer
periods
of
time.
Many
players
built
it
into
a
Philosopher's
Stone
for
its
superior
effects
for
a
relatively
low
cost
(365g).
Trivia
It
appears
to
be
a
metal
pendant
holding
an
emerald.
Emeralds
are
often
associated
with
healing
powers.
