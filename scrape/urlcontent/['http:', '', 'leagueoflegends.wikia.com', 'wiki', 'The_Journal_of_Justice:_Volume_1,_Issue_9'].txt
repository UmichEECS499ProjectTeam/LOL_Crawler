Clearing
Obstacles
for
a
Rematch
Noxus
responds
to
the
monk’s
plight
Quinton
Groat
reporting
from
Noxus
The
tragic
news
of
the
Shojin
monk
,
who
suffers
even
now,
has
shocked
Runeterrans
everywhere.
Flowers
and
well-wishes
have
arrived
at
the
Shojin
Monastery
in
droves.
Public
vigils
have
been
held
in
every
city-state,
and
hundreds
of
letters
have
been
sent
to
the
Institute
of
War
,
pleading
for
intervention
on
behalf
of
the
monk.
This
event
is
heartbreaking,
but
the
amount
of
public
response
generated
for
one
man
is
inspiring.
Today,
in
the
midst
of
all
these
stirred
emotions,
the
Noxian
High
Command
made
a
stunning
announcement.
Chancellor
Malek
Hawkmoon,
the
officer
of
the
Noxian
High
Command
charged
with
overseeing
the
Noxian
presence
in
Ionia
,
gave
this
statement
after
returning
from
an
emergency
conference
in
Noxus.
"After
conferring
with
my
honored
colleagues
in
the
High
Command,
we
have
decided
to
take
this
grievous
situation
into
our
own
hands
and
bring
the
people
of
Valoran
some
peace.
Before
I
go
into
further
detail,
I
would
like
to
address
some
of
the
statements
which
have
been
made
surrounding
our
presence
in
Ionia."
"It
has
been
said
that
Noxus
is
a
heartless,
imperialistic
war
machine.
It
has
been
implied
that
ours
is
the
seat
of
evil.
I
would
like
to
assure
you,
we
have
families,
homes,
and
children
just
like
anyone
else,
and
our
soldiers
in
Ionia
miss
theirs
dearly.
Our
undertaking
there
has
been
in
the
service
of
the
Ionians.
In
the
wake
of
the
war,
these
southern
provinces
were
left
in
debris
and
disarray.
We
have
spent
our
own
precious
resources
rebuilding
what
was
lost
and
the
'riches
we
now
plunder'
are
far
from
compensation
for
what
we
have
invested
in
these
efforts."
"Noxus
is
indeed
a
war
machine,
for
this
we
are
proud,
not
ashamed.
Our
sons
put
their
lives
at
stake
in
the
pursuit
of
excellence.
We
respect
those
who
meet
us
on
the
battlefield
too
much
to
treat
them
like
children
or
invalids.
If
you
oppose
Noxian
forces,
you
are
considered
an
equal
opponent,
and
granted
no
quarter,
as
such
is
the
highest
insult
amongst
true
warriors.
It
is
a
disgrace
to
cross
blades
with
an
enemy
and
then
cry
oppression
when
you
are
bested.
Ionia
was
given
the
option
to
surrender
without
violence,
as
are
all
nations
which
the
noble
Noxian
forces
visit.
They
declined,
and
they
lost.
I
wonder
if
the
public
would
react
the
same
way
if
Noxus
requested
repayment
for
the
sons
it
lost
in
the
Ionian
incursion."
"Now,
as
I
said,
Noxus
has
decided
to
do
what
is
in
its
power
to
bring
peace
to
Valoran,
though
we
have
received
nothing
but
threats
and
slander
since
the
monk’s
protest
began.
Noxian
blood
is
infused
with
the
scent
of
the
battlefield,
and
Noxians
do
not
hide
behind
politics.
Make
no
mistake,
challenging
the
edicts
of
the
League
of
Legends
is
not
only
unlawful,
but
undermining
to
a
system
which
has
saved
Runeterra
from
ruin.
However,
it
is
our
right
to
grant
Ionia
its
rematch
before
the
proper
term
has
elapsed,
and
we
have
heard
their
plea.
If
Ionia
desires
to
meet
Noxus
on
the
Fields
of
Justice
to
determine
the
fate
of
the
southern
provinces,
then
we
accept
the
terms
and
encourage
them
to
send
their
very
best."
The
Ionian
Elders
called
an
assembly
immediately
following
Hawkmoon's
speech,
and
they
promised
that
an
official
response
was
soon
to
follow.
The
Master
of
Metal
Mordekaiser
and
Zaun's
Techma-Tune
scene
Jace
P.
Prest
reporting
from
Zaun
Sona
and
Mordekaiser
storm
Zaun
with
their
wildly
popular
band,
Pentakill
Down
in
the
slums
of
Zaun
,
where
the
gutters
glow
green
with
techmaturgical
runoff,
one
can
find
all
manner
of
unsavory
characters:
the
disreputable,
the
disadvantaged,
and
the
disillusioned.
These
are
the
homes
of
back-alley
sorcerers
and
shimmer
addicts,
all
those
whom
critics
say
are
the
byproducts
of
Zaun's
rapid
and
reckless
research
initiatives.
Yet,
despite
(or
perhaps,
because
of)
the
many
negative
images
associated
with
the
Zaunite
slums,
thrill
seekers
frequently
venture
down
to
these
dark
alleys.
They
come
in
larger
numbers
every
week,
and
all
come
for
one
reason:
the
undeniable
allure
of
Zaun's
underground
techmaturgical
music
scene.
With
instruments
powered
by
techmaturgical
amplification,
"Techma-Tune"
musicians
and
their
strange,
wailing
sound
have
been
gaining
ground
in
Zaunian
taverns
for
years.
Those
hip
to
the
scene
gather
in
droves
to
listen
to
the
stylings
of
bands
such
as
"The
Hexbenders",
"
Yordle
Mothership",
or
"Tainted
Nexus
".
For
the
price
of
a
cheap
(and
questionably
concocted)
beverage,
any
traveler
can
shove
for
shoulder-room
to
see
these
talented
groups
perform.
Though
the
Techma-Tune
movement
has
long
been
an
unknown
scene
outside
of
Zaun,
a
new
star
recently
pushed
interest
in
this
genre
of
music
beyond
Zaun's
borders
and
into
the
hearts
and
minds
of
countless
Valorans.
For
the
past
few
months,
Mordekaiser,
the
Master
of
Metal
and
champion
of
the
League,
has
been
storming
the
stages
of
Zaun
with
devastating
effect
as
lead
guitarist
of
the
band
"Pentakill".
His
dark,
pounding
rhythms
resonate
deeply
with
his
followers.
One
fan
says,
"His
strings
speak
to
the
torment
of
my
existence."
Another
gushes,
"I
know
that
deep
beneath
that
armor
beats
a
broken
heart
like
mine.
I
love
you,
Mordekaiser!"
We
had
the
privilege
of
speaking
briefly
with
the
League
fighter
and
night
rocker:
JP:
Mordekaiser,
you're
an
enigma
both
in
and
out
of
the
arena.
What
draws
you
away
from
the
Field
of
Justice
to
pursue
this
surprising
side-project?
M:
My
fans.
I
am
drawn
to
their
disease.
JP:
You
mean
their
feverish
love
of
this
Techma-Tune
music?
M:
No.
Pentakill's
popularity
exploded
recently
when
Mordekaiser
appeared
on
stage
with
an
unlikely
co-star:
Sona,
the
League's
darling
diva
!
The
masterful
mistress
of
strings
has
been
regularly
rocking
at
Mordekaiser's
side
in
true
Techma-Tune
style,
clad
in
silver
chains
and
black
finery.
The
two
have
been
busy
releasing
more
captivating
singles
than
ever
before,
with
Sona's
otherworldly
serenades
adding
a
somber
and
captivating
undertone
to
Mordekaiser's
gritty,
powerful
chords.
Though
Sona
was
(understandably)
unavailable
for
comment,
Mordekaiser
has
confirmed
his
desire
to
expand
the
ensemble
further
into
a
full
band:
"I
would
welcome
those
who
would
bring
my
music
further
power.
We
are
known
as
Pentakill,
and
we
shall
rock
as
no
other.
Join
us,
if
you
are
so
bold."
Hear
Pentakill
perform
their
new
hit,
"Mask
of
Madness"
at
Trogsworth's
Tavern
in
the
heart
of
Zaun’s
trade
district
any
night
this
week.
Be
warned
–
it's
standing
room
only
and
the
crowd
can
get
a
little
raucous.
Also,
if
you
yourself
are
a
talented
techma-musician,
gather
your
courage
and
approach
the
stage
afterwards
for
a
personal
audition!
The
Unstoppable
Hurricane
Friends
and
foes
alike
celebrate
the
Might
of
Demacia
Aria
Breker
commenting
from
Demacia
The
pursuit
of
justice
is
often
a
thankless
job.
When
our
soldiers
are
tirelessly
toiling
on
the
front
lines,
their
benevolence
is
often
met
with
hostility,
even
from
those
who
they
are
trying
to
protect
and
defend.
However,
there
are
often
happier
and
unintended
side
effects
for
those
who
fight
under
Demacia
's
banner.
Garen
,
one
of
Demacia's
League
champions,
now
finds
himself
at
the
center
of
attention
from
citizens
and
summoners
alike
due
to
his
domination
on
the
Fields
of
Justice.
His
battle
prowess
has
brought
widespread
fame
to
both
himself
and
our
grand
city-state.
Eyes
have
turned
to
Garen
as
a
leader,
carrying
his
teams
to
victory
in
the
name
of
Demacia.
Recent
broadcast
matches
featuring
the
Might
of
Demacia
have
drawn
extraordinary
amounts
of
excitement.
Spectators
are
often
found
reveling
in
the
streets
of
almost
every
city-state
after
a
match,
ecstatically
hailing
Garen's
performance
on
the
battlefield.
Fans
describe
Garen
as
"tireless",
"invincible",
and
"...almost
as
if
he
never
needs
to
cool
down".
They
delight
in
the
fact
that
he
is
able
to
silence
enemies
with
the
mighty
swing
of
his
blade,
seemingly
unconstrained
by
the
limitations
that
other
champions
seem
to
face.
The
artistic
have
taken
to
expressing
their
admiration
for
Garen's
skill
by
deluging
the
local
markets
with
paintings
and
songs
reflecting
Demacian
pride.
Children
run
through
the
streets
of
city-states
across
Valoran,
yelling
"DEMACIA!"
much
to
the
chagrin
of
parents
trying
to
instill
their
offspring
with
pride
for
their
own
city-states.
Garen
has
made
quite
an
impression
on
non-supporters
as
well.
Even
those
who
support
other
champions
in
the
League
grudgingly
acknowledge
his
unmistakable
battle
presence.
Opponents
have
been
overheard
calling
him
an
"unstoppable
hurricane".
Others
swear
that
they
can
almost
see
Garen's
mighty
sword
striking
down
from
above
when
he
claims
a
foe.
Not
all
opinions
are
positive,
however,
with
dissenters
complaining
about
Garen
being
judgmental
on
the
battlefield;
painfully
so.
Some
claim
that
he
seems
overpowered,
as
though
Garen's
fighting
ability
and
battle-tested
skills
were
anything
but
well-earned
from
experience.
Demacian
military
officials
have
taken
note
of
Garen's
exceptional
performance.
Already
the
leader
of
the
Dauntless
Vanguard,
Garen
was
called
upon
to
bring
his
expertise
to
overhaul
Demacia's
military
training.
His
training
program,
called
"Battle
Regimen
for
Ultimate
Soldier
Heroism",
has
since
been
introduced
to
the
entire
Demacian
army.
It
is
a
well-crafted
conditioning
program
wherein
soldiers
learn
a
variety
of
tactics
and
strategies
employed
by
Garen
on
the
Fields
of
Justice,
including
perseverance,
courage,
and
how
to
strike
decisively
against
our
foes.
Armed
with
the
"Battle
Regimen
for
Ultimate
Soldier
Heroism"
fighting
strategy,
the
enemies
of
justice
have
much
to
fear.
When
the
Demacian
army
descends
upon
challengers,
our
enemies
will
not
stand
a
chance
against
the
whirlwind
of
might.

Who
Didn't
See
This
Coming?
Just
a
few
days
ago,
Calliope
Productions
(located
in
Demacia)
announced
its
latest
musical,
The
Sound
of
Magic
.
Now,
normally
this
reporter
could
not
care
less
about
musicals,
so
why
the
sudden
interest
in
this
one?
Because
this
one
is
helmed
by
the
Gemknight
himself!
The
Sound
of
Magic
isn't
just
a
musical
–
it's
a
symphonic
bonanza.
This
reporter
was
fortunate
enough
(depending
upon
your
point
of
view)
to
have
been
allowed
into
one
of
the
rehearsals.
The
songs
are
epic,
pretty
much
everyone
is
dancing,
and
the
costumes
are,
well,
outrageous.
I've
never
seen
so
much
frilly
business
in
my
entire
life,
and
the
colors
make
it
look
like
a
flower
bed
threw
up.
Taric
is
the
lead
designer
in
all
of
this,
and
it
shows.
The
Gemknight
actually
deigned
to
give
me
a
few
choice
words:
"I'm
excited
about
this
opportunity.
Musical
theater
has
always,
in
some
way,
been
in
my
blood.
This
production
is
top
notch
and
I
am
honored
to
be
center
stage.
It's
wonderful
that
I
get
to
show
my
fans
a
different
side
of
me."
It
certainly
is
going
to
be
a
stark
contrast
to
butt-kicking
for
a
living,
that's
for
sure.
Hopefully,
the
prime
performances
won't
interfere
with
Taric's
duties
to
the
League
of
Legends.
If
not,
maybe
he
can
bring
some
singing
and
dancing
to
his
battles
–
maybe
even
in
one
of
those
frilly
costumes...
as
long
as
they
don't
clash
with
his
hammer!
Little
Poppy's
Big
Vacation
As
both
Bandle
City's
ambassador
to
Demacia
and
as
a
champion
in
the
League
of
Legends,
Poppy
certainly
has
a
lot
of
responsibility.
She
also
has
fame
and
power,
which
give
her
command
over
resources
that
would
make
this
reporter
blush...
and
she's
been
busted
for
abusing
it!
How,
you
might
ask?
How
could
such
a
beloved
Champion,
such
a
sweet
little
yordle,
be
guilty
of
abusing
anything?
By
using
those
resources
to
travel
to
Seafoam,
the
exclusive
resort
on
the
western
coast,
vacation
spot
for
the
wealthy
of
Demacia.
This
reporter
received
a
tip
from
an
anonymous
source
which
revealed
the
following
information.
According
to
her
position,
Poppy
is
given
a
certain
amount
of
money
a
year
to
travel
as
an
ambassador.
This
amount
is
significant,
but
not
enough
for
a
luxury
vacation
–
but
this
is
exactly
where
the
money
came
from.
The
yordle
Champion
racked
up
room
service
bills,
spa
days,
shopping
sprees
on
the
renowned
Grayhill
Road,
and
a
stay
in
the
penthouse
suite
of
a
five-star
resort
hotel.
The
estimated
cost
of
this
single
vacation
is
far
in
excess
of
the
annual
income
of
most
Valorian
citizens.
Naturally,
neither
Poppy
nor
any
of
her
staff
was
available
for
comment.
Do
I
believe
Poppy
has
a
tough
job?
Yes.
Do
I
believe
she
deserves
time
off
to
enjoy
her
life?
Absolutely.
Do
I
believe
that
she
should
be
allowed
to
take
over-the-top
expensive
vacations
on
the
Demacian
tax-payers
money?
No
way.
So
what
can
we
do
to
hold
officials
like
Poppy
accountable
during
moments
of
financial
mismanagement
like
this?
It
is
the
responsibility
of
you,
the
reader,
to
write
to
the
Demacian
government,
and
let
your
opinions
be
known!
On
the
other
hand,
the
question
many
readers
will
want
an
answer
to:
does
Poppy
take
Whomper
to
the
beach?
This
reporter
thinks
yes.
Dear
Mr.
Steed
Once
again,
I
dig
into
my
mailbag
to
see
what
sort
of
fascinating
letters
you,
the
readers,
have
sent
me.
This
week's
question
is
interesting.
"Dear
Mr.
Steed
–
Has
Rammus
ever
tried
to
encourage
other
armadillos
to
go
into
the
Kumungu
Jungle
in
hopes
they
might
also
change?"
--
Salindor
the
Summoner
Consider
that
you're
the
only
sentient
armadillo
on
Valoran,
and
you're
a
guy.
What
do
you
think
would
eventually
something
that
you'd
want
in
your
life?
That's
right
–
a
female
counterpart.
Rammus
has
been
around
the
League
for
a
while
now.
When
asked,
Rammus
had
this
to
say:
"Shut
up."
Sources
close
to
Rammus
say
that
he
is
unabashed
in
finding
young
female
armadillos
and
trying
to
get
them
to
go
to
the
Plague
Lands.
He's
offered
protection
and
everything.
There
are
some
who
have
gone
with
him,
but
the
rare
magic
that
created
Rammus
in
the
first
place
isn't
likely
to
come
out
and
play
just
because
someone
asks.
It
hasn't
stopped
him
from
trying,
and
he
has
no
lack
of
volunteers,
as
it
appears
that
he
is
a
bit
of
sex
symbol
to
the
armadillo
community
(which
looks
really
weird
now
that
I've
actually
written
that
out).
Thanks
for
writing
in,
Salindor!
If
you've
got
something
to
say
to
Ram
Steed,
mail
me
personally
here
at
the
Journal.
Some
infernal
techmaturgical
machine
will
get
your
message
and
pass
it
on
to
me.
The
Mailbag
of
Justice
Reader
mail
from
all
across
Valoran
–
answered!
Senior
Summoner
Ralston
Farnsley
commenting
from
the
Institute
of
War
These
are
eventful
times
–
the
monk's
protest
has
stunned
Ionians
and
incited
the
passions
of
citizens
all
over
Valoran.
We
at
the
Journal
of
Justice
have
many
feelings
about
these
events,
and
although
we
cannot
control
their
outcomes,
I
can
promise
you
that
we
will
continue
providing
you
with
the
most
late-breaking
news
(every
two
weeks)!
"Honestly
I
must
know,
why
does
everyone
even
acknowledge
the
League
when
they
are
all
going
to
be
wiped
out
by
the
Void
?
Our
prophet
Malzahar
has
already
assured
us
that
the
Void
is
coming
and
there
is
nothing
we
can
do
to
stop
it.
I
only
hope
that
my
dedication
to
the
Void
is
taken
notice
and
Malzahar
will
help
save
me
from
the
impending
doom."
--
profpwn
We
recognize
that
there
is
a
growing
faction
of
Runeterrans
who
either
worry
about
or
welcome
the
Void,
particularly
as
Malzahar
has
gained
popularity
in
the
League.
You
are
free
to
believe
what
you
please,
profpwn,
but
there
have
been
incidents
in
the
past
where
Void
cultists
have
turned
to
violence,
either
against
themselves
or
others.
I
want
you
to
understand
that
this
sort
of
behavior
only
hurts
you
and
those
around
you.
If
there
is
any
truth
to
what
Malzahar
is
saying,
I
would
rather
use
my
magic
to
protect
Runeterra
and
its
citizens,
and
I'd
really
like
to
have
you
on
my
side!
"Several
individuals
have
sought
my
explanation
as
to
why
certain
champions,
on
a
nigh
weekly
basis,
seem
more
willing
to
serve
more
summoners,
requiring
little
to
no
influence
within
the
League
to
gain
access
to
their
powers.
Would
you
mind
providing
the
good
people
of
Valoran
a
general
explanation?"
--
Adjudicator
Fayd
This
is
a
good
point
to
bring
up,
Adjudicator,
thank
you
for
your
assistance
educating
the
younger
summoners.
The
League
of
Legends
serves
many
purposes.
First
and
foremost,
it
acts
as
a
mediator
for
the
city-states
so
that
conflicts
can
be
resolved
without
causing
harm
to
the
world.
However,
the
League
is
also
a
medium
through
which
people
all
over
Runeterra
can
find
common
ground.
People
from
all
corners
of
the
world
attune
their
crystal
screens
to
broadcasts
of
battles
on
the
Fields
of
Justice.
All
champions
admitted
to
the
League
must
make
themselves
available
from
time
to
time
–
both
for
the
younger
summoners
to
refine
their
arts
and
also
so
that
there
are
always
battles
to
watch.
"The
protests
of
the
Ionian
monk
have
drawn
a
great
deal
of
attention
recently,
turning
the
eyes
of
thousands
to
the
island
city-state.
As
with
many
others,
I
extend
my
sympathies
to
the
Ionians,
but
I
am
curious
as
to
what
actions
the
league
is
considering
about
the
issue."
--
Cykrus,
Demacian
Summoner
Many
people
share
your
concerns,
Cykrus.
I
cannot
speak
in
an
official
capacity
for
the
League,
but
I
know
that
this
issue
is
being
taken
very
seriously.
The
fact
that
Ionians
felt
the
need
to
protest
so
deeply
moves
the
heart,
but
I
think
it’s
important
to
remember
that
both
parties
agreed
to
the
terms
of
the
Trial
for
the
Isle
well
beforehand.
At
the
same
time,
the
Shojin
monks
have
long
been
a
beacon
of
wisdom
for
people
all
over
Runeterra.
The
loss
of
even
one
is
a
tragedy
for
thousands.
Unfortunately,
I
think
the
best
we
can
do
is
to
remain
calm
and
hope
for
a
fair
resolution
before
his
magic
runs
out.
