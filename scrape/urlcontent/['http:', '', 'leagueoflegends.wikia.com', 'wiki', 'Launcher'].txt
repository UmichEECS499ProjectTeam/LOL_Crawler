Functionality
The
launcher
is
a
platform
for
PVP.net
to
launch
from.
It
checks
to
see
the
status
of
the
League
of
Legends
servers,
the
launcher
makes
sure
the
League
of
Legends
and
PVP.net
files
are
up-to-date
and
it
also
provides
links
to
recent
announcements
from
LeagueofLegends.com
.
A
new
launcher
was
officially
released
on
May
3rd
2011,
after
some
months
in
beta
testing,
to
solve
some
of
the
issues
users
were
having
with
patching.
It
is
in
fact
able
to
fix
data
corruption,
and
is
overall
far
more
reliable,
with
more
descriptive
messages
in
case
of
error.
The
new
launcher
also
stores
information
about
older
releases,
so
that
it
can
launch
previous
versions
of
the
game.
This
feature
is
required
to
have
a
replay
system
that
doesn't
break
with
new
content
releases.

and
Language

The
new

preference,
in
the
following

You
need
an
account
for
every
region.
Its
not
possible
to
log
in
with
your
EU-West
account
to
the
EU
Nordic
&
East
servers,
same
for
all
other
regions.
Players
can
only
transfer
to
other
regions
if
they
pay
Riot
Points
for
it.
The
price
is
different
for
every
region.
Remember
that
if
you
transfer,
you
will
lose
your
account
on
that
region,
and
it
will
be
go
to
that
other
region.
Attempting
to
log
onto
an
account
in
the
incorrect
region
will
result
in
the
launcher
closing
and
the
next
time
you
launch
the
game,
the
region
will
change
to
the
one
intended
for
the
account.
Server
Status
Online:
League
of
Legends
servers
are
currently
online.
Log
in
and
play
any
time!.
Unavailable:
League
of
Legends
servers
are
currently
offline
for
maintenance
or
are
experiencing
technical
difficulties.
Busy:
League
of
Legends
servers
are
currently
set
to
busy
to
help
us
maintain
the
stability
of
the
service.
.
It
was
used
in
the
past
for
traffic
shaping
on
patch
days,
to
only
let
a
limited
(but
increasing)
number
of
users
connect
to
the
servers.
Traffic
shaping
is
now
handled
by
the
FIFO
styled
Login
Queue
,
but
the
Busy
status
can
still
be
set
in
cases
of
server
issues,
where
the
servers
are
online
but
users
are
still
not
allowed
to
log
in.
Blocked:
The
launcher
is
not
able
to
contact
the
League
of
Legends
servers,
due
to
a
firewall
of
some
sort
interfering
with
the
client.
