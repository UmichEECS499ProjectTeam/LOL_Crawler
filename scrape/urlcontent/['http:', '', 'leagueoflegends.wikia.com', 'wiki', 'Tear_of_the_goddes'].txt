Background
Few
are
fortunate
enough
to
come
across
the
tears
of
the
very
goddess
who
created
our
world...
but
those
who
are
lucky
enough
to
acquire
a
Tear
of
the
Goddess
may
take
pleasure
in
a
significant
boost
of
mana
points
and
mana
points
regeneration.
Notes
After
upgraded
into
Manamune
or
Archangel's
Staff
,
the
item
retains
the
mana
gained
from
its
passive.
Selling
Tear
of
the
Goddess
and
its
upgrades
removes
the
bonus
mana.
There
is
a
small
window
of
time
during
which
Tear
of
the
Goddess
or
related
items
can
be
re-bought
while
still
retaining
the
bonus
mana
stacks.
In
addition,
while
any
Tear
of
the
Goddess
or
related
item
is
held,
the
bonus
mana
stacks
are
retained,
even
if
the
original
item
used
to
gain
the
stacks
is
sold.
Assuming
a
charge
is
gained
every
4
seconds,
the
750-mana
unique
passive
takes
11
minutes
and
7
seconds
to
max.
The
bonus
mana
does
not
stack
with
Archangel's
Staff
,
Manamune
,
or
another
Tear
of
the
Goddess
.
The
bonus
mana
does
stack
with
Seraph's
Embrace
and
Muramana
.
This
is
due
to
the
fully
formed
Seraph's
Embrace
and
Muramana
not
having
the
Mana
Charge
passive.
The
tear
starts
at
0
however,
and
must
be
charged
again.
Useful
in
mana
stacking
strategies
such
as
Muramana
Ryze
.
Manaless
champions
may
charge
the
Tear
of
the
Goddess
,
Manamune
and
Archangel's
Staff
to
get
Muramana
and
Seraph's
Embrace
.
However,
they
won't
get
any
bonuses
of
Muramana
's
Awe
and
toggle,
as
well
as
Seraph's
Embrace
's
Insight
and
Mana
Shield
.
Strategy
Tear
of
the
Goddess
is
an
ideal
item
for
champions
with
low
cooldown
abilities
such
as
Ryze
,
Karthus
,
Ezreal
,
Kog'Maw
,
Urgot
or
Nidalee
(abilities
in
Aspect
of
the
Cougar
do
not
cost
mana).
It
is
a
good
item
for
champions
with
abilities
that
have
an
upkeep
cost
like
Swain
,
Anivia
,
Singed
,
etc.
Fiddlesticks
and
Ryze
are
the
only
champions
in
the
game
who
are
unable
to
charge
Tear
of
the
Goddess
without
an
enemy
target
(factoring
only
basic
abilities).
The
passive
cannot
be
charged
with
transform
ultimates
that
cost
no
mana
such
as
Jayce's
Transform:
Mercury
Cannon
/
Hammer
,
Elise's
Spider
Form
/
Human
Form
and
Nidalee's
Aspect
of
the
Cougar
.
Tear
of
the
Goddess
combines
excellently
with
champions
with
spammable
abilities
or
abilities
with
low
costs
that
constantly
consume
mana
(e.g.
Soraka's
Starcall
,
Singed's
Poison
Trail
,
or
Karthus's
Lay
Waste
),
ideally
bringing
a
fully
filled
Tear
of
the
Goddess
at
the
20
minute
mark.
