Steve
“Guinsoo”
Feak
is
one
of
the
original
creators
of
DotA-Allstars,
which
is
a
mod
of
Warcraft
3
played
by
over
10
million
people
worldwide.
Despite
this,
Steve
is
a
modest
man
from
humble
beginnings.
He
was
born
under
a
haystack
in
Wisconsin
and
enjoys
spending
time
with
his
girlfriend,
eating
good
old
American
food,
and
playing
with
his
cat.
He
is
also
a
diehard
Brewers,
Packers,
and
Bucks
fan.
As
a
gamer,
Steve
has
a
special
place
in
his
heart
for
World
of
Warcraft,
Counter-Strike,
Diablo
2,
DotA,
and
old-school
RPGs.
Special
Ability
Clairvoyance
:
Guinsoo
solves
a
Rubik’s
cube
with
a
few
deft
flicks
of
the
wrists
and
enters
a
deep
calm
visualizing
a
new
character
being
played
in-game.
Using
this
vision,
Guinsoo
pieces
together
spell
building
blocks
and
design
ideas
to
bring
the
character
to
life.
DotA:
Allstars
Main
article:
Defense
of
the
Ancients:
Allstars
Feak
was
the
previous
designer
of
the
popular
Warcraft
III:
the
Frozen
Throne
custom
map,
DotA:
Allstars.
Using
the
original
DotA
created
by
Eul
(the
original
Defense
of
the
Ancients
map
for
Warcraft
III:
Reign
Of
Chaos
as
a
base,
Feak
made
DotA:
Allstars
by
adding
his
own
mix
of
content.
Among
the
DotA
variants
created
in
the
wake
of
Eul's
map,
Allstars
become
the
most
popular
version
of
the
map.
Feak
said
when
he
began
developing
Allstars
he
had
no
idea
how
popular
the
game
would
eventually
become;
the
emerging
success
of
the
game
type
inspired
him
to
design
a
new
title
around
what
he
considered
an
emerging
game
genre.
Feak
added
a
recipe
system
for
items
so
that
player's
equipment
would
scale
as
they
grew
more
powerful,
as
well
as
a
powerful
boss
character
called
Roshan
(named
after
his
bowling
ball)
who
required
an
entire
team
to
defeat.
Feak
used
a
Battle.net
chat
channel
as
a
place
for
DotA
players
to
congregate,
but
DotA:
Allstars
had
no
official
site
for
discussions
and
hosting.
The
leaders
of
the
DotA:
Allstars
CLAN,
TDA,
proposed
that
a
dedicated
web
site
be
created
to
replace
the
various
online
alternatives
that
were
infrequently
updated
or
improperly
maintained.
Towards
the
end
of
his
association
with
the
map,
Feak
primarily
worked
on
optimizing
the
map,
then
he
left
development
with
version
6.01,
passing
it
to
the
current
developer,
Icefrog.
