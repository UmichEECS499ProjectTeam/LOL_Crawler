Angered
Monk
Sets
Self
on
Fire
Ionian
protests
become
extreme
Nick
Vand
reporting
from
Ionia
The
protesting
Shojin
Monk
did
not
cry
out
or
break
his
meditative
pose
except
once
to
stop
onlookers
from
trying
to
put
the
fire
out.
Today,
Ionia
's
famous
Lotus
Gardens
were
not
the
site
of
their
usual
beauty.
Monks
from
the
Shojin
Monastery
assembled
in
protest
of
the
Noxian
occupation
of
the
Navori
Province,
which
is
located
in
southern
Ionia.
One
of
the
monks
first
gave
an
inspiring
speech
against
what
many
see
as
Noxus'
needless
occupation.
He
then
covered
himself
with
lamp
oil,
crouched
in
a
meditative
pose,
and
lit
himself
on
fire.
Fortunately,
this
act
does
not
need
to
be
one
of
suicide.
The
Shojin
monks
have
long
practiced
healing
martial
arts.
However,
the
burning
monk
will
survive
only
in
a
suspended
state
of
agony
for
many
days.
When
the
last
leaf
falls
from
the
lovingly
sculpted
bonsai
placed
next
to
him,
his
time
will
run
out.
It
is
unknown
what
the
monks
will
do
when
that
leaf
falls,
if
action
isn’t
taken.
Hundreds
of
miles
away,
Soraka,
the
Starchild
of
Ionia
,
wept
openly
when
she
heard
this
news.
Yesterday,
she
had
this
to
say:
"It
is
a
sad
day
when
the
peaceful
monks
of
the
Shojin
Monastery
must
resort
to
such
extreme
measures.
Ionia
is
a
land
of
enlightenment.
When
the
only
way
to
find
help
for
one's
cause
is
so
horrible,
the
situation
is
more
than
grim.
Hopefully,
the
rest
of
Runeterra
will
finally
take
notice
of
the
cruelty
inflicted
upon
my
people
by
the
Noxian
government."
League
Champion
Katarina
,
speaking
on
behalf
of
her
father
and
the
rest
of
the
Noxian
High
Command,
responded
with
the
following:
"Our
presence
in
Ionia
is
for
the
good
of
the
people.
Their
economic
state
is
not
ready
to
deal
with
the
rest
of
Valoran
.
Their
practices
are
out-dated.
Theirs
is
the
domain
of
sad
old
men
who
believe
the
world
should
not
progress
past
them.
This
incident
is
a
tragedy,
but
it
is
not
a
statement
on
behalf
of
the
Ionian
people.
It
is
a
statement
by
those
who
are
unwilling
to
embrace
the
future."
Public
outcry
regarding
this
event
is
tremendous.
Citizens
from
Bandle
City
to
the
Freljord
,
from
Demacia
to
the
Great
Barrier,
have
expressed
their
outrage.
Images
have
spread
throughout
the
civilized
world,
shown
on
every
Crystal
Screen
and
Spinning
Wire
connected
to
a
network.
Perhaps
the
most
amazing
part
of
this
horrifying
display
is
the
priest's
incredible
willpower.
Even
as
he
sits
burning,
he
does
not
cry
out.
He
is
letting
his
quiet
agony
speak
for
itself.
Some
members
of
a
growing
crowd
of
onlookers
even
tried
to
put
him
out.
In
response,
he
broke
his
meditation
only
long
enough
to
stop
them
with
a
firm
gesture.
This
is
a
powerful
statement
against
what
many
feel
is
the
oppression
of
the
Ionian
peoples.
The
images
are
haunting
and
the
message
is
clear.
However,
the
question
at
hand
is
clear:
what
will
the
League
of
Legends
do
about
what
many
feel
is
the
legacy
of
an
unsanctioned
and
inhuman
war?
The
Noxus-Ionia
Conflict
Looking
Back
on
the
Bloody
Invasion
Nick
Vand
reporting
from
Ionia
It
began
only
a
few
years
after
the
League
of
Legends
was
formed.
Ionia,
a
peaceful
isle
in
the
Guardian's
Sea,
initially
refused
to
join.
The
people
there
chose
to
pursue
enlightenment
instead
of
war.
The
destructive
conflicts
between
Noxus
and
Demacia
were
the
primary
reason
that
the
League
was
formed.
The
two
powers
agreed
to
no
longer
wage
war
against
each
other.
Noxus,
not
content
to
sit
aside
quietly,
turned
its
expansionistic
eye
towards
those
who
remained
outside
of
the
League's
jurisdiction.
Their
sights
settled
on
Ionia.
The
Noxian
High
Command
saw
Ionia
as
a
weak
target.
To
them,
it
was
a
land
of
softer
things,
ill-prepared
to
defend
itself
against
invaders.
Noxian
spies
began
to
trade
aggressively
with
Ionia,
traveling
to
the
island
to
study
its
weaknesses
and
identify
critical
targets.
When
the
plan
was
formed,
the
forces
of
Noxus
invaded.
The
southern
provinces
of
Ionia
were
the
most
open
to
trade.
This
also
made
them
among
the
wealthiest.
It
was
here
that
the
Noxian
forces
landed
under
the
cover
of
night.
Groups
of
Noxian
agents
had
gone
ahead,
their
spies
confounding
and
sabotaging
potential
defenses.
After
being
met
with
little
resistance,
Noxus’
forces
formed
their
first
beachheads
and
began
their
invasion
in
earnest.
The
invasion
continued,
heavily
in
the
favor
of
Noxian
forces.
However,
Ionia
did
not
surrender.
In
response
to
a
growing
Ionian
resistance,
Noxus
brought
in
mercenaries
from
Zaun
.
If
the
Noxians
were
bad,
the
Zaunites
were
worse.
The
mad
scientists
brought
with
them
inhuman
tactics,
unleashing
their
cruel
creations
on
the
people.
This
terror
was
what
finally
unleashed
the
anger
of
the
Ionians.
Bringing
all
its
might
and
martial
traditions
to
bear,
Ionia
fought
back
fiercely.
Ionian
warriors
eventually
brought
the
invaders
to
a
stalemate,
forcing
them
back
to
their
power
bases
on
the
island.
Despite
their
losses,
the
forces
of
Noxus
remained
in
control
of
three
of
the
wealthiest
southern
provinces
–
Galrin,
Navori,
and
Shon-Xan.
Ionian
diplomats
then
sought
to
put
political
pressure
on
Noxus
in
an
attempt
to
drive
them
out.
However,
the
Noxian
High
Command
claimed
that
they
were
there
for
the
good
of
the
people.
They
said
that
Ionia
had
failed
to
join
the
modern
age,
and
that
Noxus
had
sympathizers
who
supported
the
occupation.
Seven
years
after
the
invasion
began,
the
remaining
Ionian
Families,
brought
together
by
the
Duchess
Karma,
decided
that
there
was
only
one
recourse
left.
They
petitioned
to
join
the
League
of
Legends,
so
that
they
could
have
a
match
to
drive
Noxus
out
once
and
for
all.
However,
they
made
their
belief
that
Ionia
was
being
forced
to
join
the
League
in
order
to
ensure
its
future
security
known
to
the
world.
Their
membership
was
granted
and
the
match
was
set.
The
“Trial
for
the
Isle”
was
perhaps
one
of
the
most
famous
matches
of
all
time.
Unfortunately
for
those
who
were
wronged,
Ionia
failed,
albeit
amidst
questionable
circumstances.
Some
insist
that
Noxus’
victory
came
as
the
result
of
pre-match
tampering.
To
this
day,
Noxian
forces
still
occupy
southern
Ionia.
Native
Ionians
are
treated
as
second-class
citizens
by
the
ruling
Noxian
elite.
Soldiers,
political
dissidents,
and
anyone
else
who
threatens
the
Noxians
have
been
interred
in
labor
camps.
Forces
continue
to
plunder
the
wealth
and
natural
resources
of
the
island,
sending
the
spoils
back
to
Noxus.
There
is
much
external
political
pressure,
particularly
on
the
part
of
Demacia,
for
the
invaders
to
leave.
The
Noxian
High
Command
claims
that
they
will
leave
once
Ionia
has
been
modernized
enough
to
economically
compete
in
the
world
and
protect
itself
from
foreign
threats.
However,
the
situation
remains
as
it
has,
as
the
outcome
was
decided
legally
in
the
League
of
Legends.
There
are
still
eight
years
remaining
before
southern
Ionia
can
challenge
Noxus
once
again
for
their
independence.
However,
recent
protests
in
Ionia,
such
as
the
monk
self-immolation,
are
on
the
rise,
and
they
challenge
the
League’s
authority.
Ionians
claim
that
fifteen
years
was
far
too
long
a
stay
to
grant
to
the
invaders.
They
say
that
Noxus
took
advantage
of
the
newly-formed
League.
Despite
Noxian
protests
that
such
challenges
border
on
illegality,
Ionia
has
gained
much
support
in
the
court
of
public
opinion.
Going
Where
He
Pleases,
Part
Two
An
interview
with
Dr.
Mundo,
the
Madman
of
Zaun
Tom
Tarumca
reporting
from
Zaun
It
is
an
overcast
morning
in
Zaun,
as
are
most
mornings
in
the
urban
heart
of
the
city-state.
Once
again,
pollution
blocks
the
full
glory
of
the
morning
sun
and
drains
the
sky
of
its
pastels.
Visitors
have
coined
a
name
for
this
shade
of
sky:
Zaun
Gray.
It
is
an
unnatural
experience
to
an
outsider,
let
alone
color.
It
takes
a
little
getting
used
to;
looking
at
the
Zaun
sky
might
be
akin
to
seeing
the
beginnings
of
a
cosmic
disturbance.
I’m
meeting
Dr.
Mundo
in
a
private
room
of
the
Whispered
Rumor,
a
café
that
also
serves
as
one
of
Zaun’s
most
popular
watering
holes.
His
arrival
comes
with
a
significant
amount
of
fanfare.
He
is
virtually
royalty
here
in
Zaun,
and
with
that
comes
the
trappings
of
fame
–
assistants,
security,
and
various
hangers-on.
It
seems
slightly
out
of
place,
considering
Dr.
Mundo’s
notoriety
before
his
joining
the
League.
I
can’t
help
but
wonder
how
many
personal
valets
and
assistants
have
gone
missing
when
Dr.
Mundo’s
experimentations
got
the
best
of
him.
With
this
in
mind,
I
am
quick
to
get
the
interview
started.
TT:
Thank
you
for
agreeing
to
this
interview,
Dr.
Mundo.
Our
readership
certainly
wants
to
get
to
know
you
better.
DM:
Mundo
pleased
his
work
heard
of
outside
Zaun.
New
patients
always
welcome.
TT:
Duly
noted.
Your
notoriety,
your
fame
from
being
in
the
League...
how
has
it
affected
your
daily
life?
DM:
Life
not
changed
for
Mundo.
Mundo
fights
for
Zaun
and
for
Noxus
friends.
Mundo
fights
for
summoners.
Mundo
also
find
time
for
medical
research.
TT:
So
you’re
still
practicing?
DM:
More
experiments
now
that
Mundo
in
League,
but
now
mostly
funded
by
Zaun.
TT:
You
were
nearly
suspended
from
the
League
for
not
disclosing
your
use
of
adrenaline
shots.
Do
you
regret
your
decision?
DM:
Mundo
think
that
silly.
Here,
try.
At
this
point
in
the
interview,
we
took
a
four
hour
pause.
TT:
You've
been
described
as
a
bit
of
a
hermit.
How
have
you
been
able
to
deal
with
your
newfound
popularity?
DM:
Mundo
always
ladies’
man.
Now
Mundo
more
ladies’
man.
TT:
Does
that
mean
that
there's
a
Mrs.
Mundo
in
the
future?
DM:
Mundo
use
masochism
for
battle
arena,
not
for
marriage.
(pause)
Mundo
joke.
Mundo
waiting
for
special
someone.
TT:
You've
amassed
a
cult
following
here
in
Zaun.
Romantic
interests
aside,
how
do
you
feel
about
your
fans?
DM:
Mundo
great
role
model
for
kids.
TT:
It's
been
noted
by
many
that
Zaun
has
gained
a
more
favorable
political
perception
since
your
introduction
to
the
League.
Was
this
your
goal?
DM:
Mundo
keep
focused
on
battle
arena.
Mundo
keeps
eyes
on
prize.
TT:
Do
you
feel
like
the
champions
in
the
League
have
almost
too
much
power
when
it
comes
to
deciding
some
very
serious
political
matters?
DM:
Champions
only
there
to
fight.
Mundo
always
fight
his
best.
TT:
How
do
you
cope
with
the
responsibility
of
being
a
champion?
DM:
People
can
trust
Mundo.
Mundo
brains
of
operation.
TT:
So
you
think
of
yourself
as
a
leader
when
you’re
in
a
Field
of
Justice
?
DM:
Yes.
Chairman
Dunderson
call
Mundo
leader
because
Mundo
wins.
Zaun
successful
because
of
Mundo.
Mundo
brings
wins
to
Zaun.
TT:
What
does
Mundo
do
when
he's
not
cleaving
people
on
the
Fields
of
Justice?
DM:
Mundo
have
many
interests.
Mundo
recently
open
shop.
TT:
That's
right!
I
hear
you
now
own
a
business,
how
is
corporate
life?
DM:
Corporate
businessman
one
of
the
many
skins
Mundo
wear.
Mundo
also
bodybuilder.
TT:
To
wrap
things
up
here,
do
you
have
a
rival?
A
nemesis?
Who
is
the
greatest
threat
to
Mundomania?
DM:
(laughs)
Mundomania!
Mundo
using
that.
Lawyers
will
work
out
details.
(pause)
No
one
threat
to
Mundo.
Mundo
king
of
battle
arena.
TT:
So
no
other
champion
is
standing
in
your
way?
DM:
(long
pause)
Mundo
think
Anivia
is
weird.
Crazy
ice
bird
throw
up
frozen
wall
one
too
many
times.
Mundo
tired
of
smashing
face
into
wall.

Glass!
A
sampling
of
Bilgewater's
more
prominent
brands
of
rum
Cpt.
Morgan
Rackham
commenting
from
Bilgewater
With
the
guvners
in
the
League
making
sure
the
big
names
in
Valoran
play
nice,
trade
is
up
and
the
desire
for
worldly
imports
is
higher
than
ever.
Now,
I'm
just
a
simple
sailor,
so
I'm
not
about
to
start
giving
you
fashion
advice.
As
my
port
of
call
is
Bilgewater
,
however,
I
do
have
a
thing
or
two
to
share
with
you
on
the
subject
of
rum.
Whether
you're
ready
to
toss
back
a
bit
of
the
cure
for
what
ails
you,
or
you're
just
out
to
stock
the
barrels
to
keep
your
crew
in
grog
for
the
season,
I'm
here
to
help
find
just
the
bottle
you're
looking
for.
Rapture
Rum
If
you've
got
a
bit
of
jink
to
spare
and
don't
mind
paying
for
a
bit
of
celebrity,
you
can
head
on
over
to
Fortune's
Favor
on
Fleet
Street
for
a
bit
of
Miss
Fortune
's
private
stock.
Rapture
is
clear
as
diamonds,
with
a
pleasantly
clean
aroma
of
cut
cane.
To
shake
things
up,
Miss
Fortune
adds
a
hint
of
pepper
and
hot
cinnamon
to
keep
you
warm
on
deck
during
stormy
days
at
sea.
To
be
enjoyed
with
your
favorite
tropical
fruit,
Miss
Fortune's
Rapture
Rum
is
every
bit
as
much
the
exotic
beauty
that
she
is!
Gangplank's
Black
Pearl
Rum
Let
me
ask
you
a
question,
sailor.
Have
you
ever
chewed
rum?
No?!
Well
then
you've
probably
never
run
afoul
of
Gangplank
and
his
fabled
Black
Pearl.
Aged
in
charred
oak
casks
and
infused
with
some
of
the
richest
spices
that
Valoran
has
to
offer,
this
rum
comes
out
blacker
than
pitch
and
about
as
thick.
Gangplank's
Black
Pearl
is
a
draught
for
the
true
rum
enthusiast,
only.
The
rest
of
you
blokes
are
just
going
to
wind
up
feeling
barmy
and
running
for
the
deck
rails.
So
be
careful!
I've
seen
a
bit
of
the
black
stuff
lay
out
even
the
roughest
blighter
with
nary
a
hint
of
warning.
Myron's
Dark
Rum
This
rum
is
the
trademark
drink
of
Myron's
Murderhole,
one
of
the
most
famous
and
historic
bars
in
all
of
Bilgewater.
Dark
in
color
with
the
aroma
of
woody
molasses,
this
infamous
spirit
is
a
veritable
staple
of
Bilgewater
sailors
on
the
high
seas.
Richer
than
its
lighter
relatives,
this
dark
beauty
finishes
with
an
uncanny
sweetness
that's
just
perfect
for
taking
the
edge
off.
Enjoy
with
hot
water,
or
even
straight
from
the
bottle.
Either
way,
Myron's
Dark
will
keep
you
warmer
than
a
pea
coat
on
a
blustery
day.

Rum
This
rum
is
characteristically
served
at
Plankwalkin'
Pete's,
a
newfangled
bar
run
dockside
by
a
barmy
lad
with
a
peg

Light
amber
in
color,
Mount
Atin
will
assail
your
senses
with
the
aroma
of
sweet
grass,
molasses,
nutmeg,
and
just
a
hint
of
citrus.
A
bit
dry
on
its
own,
your
typical
dose
comes
served
with
tonic
and
a

so
after
a
glass
or
two
you're
well
on
your
way
to
warding
off
both
scurvy
and
malaria.
The

Valoran

Senior
Summoner
Ralston
Farnsley
commenting
from
the
Institute
of
War
In
opening
the
latest
batch
of
mail
from
the
mighty
Mailbag
of
Justice,
it
is
clear
that
the
recent
political
saga
involving
Freljord
is
fresh
on
many
of
your
minds.
We
at
the
Journal
also
share
your
concerns.
A
new
city-state,
fully
recognized
by
the
League!
These
are
interesting
times
we
live
in,
friends.
Today’s
Mailbag
addresses
those
concerns,
front
and
center.
"We
all
know
that
Ashe
didn't
choose
Tryndamere
out
of
love,
but
how
goes
the
other
way
around?
Does
Tryndamere
feel
anything
for
the
Frost
Archer?
But
the
bigger
question,
if
they
are
King
and
Queen,
should
we
expect
a
Prince
anytime
soon?
It
may
not
be
the
best
time
(with
Noxus
and
the
third
sister
being
so
hostile),
but
the
royal
line
is
thin.
Despite
what
will
happen,
I
wish
the
best
of
luck
to
the
newfound
city-state!"
--
Aurutha,
the
Silent
Watcher
A
number
of
marriages
that
have
occurred
in
the
monarchies
of
Valoran
(constitutional
or
otherwise)
have
been
arranged
out
of
convenience
rather
than
love.
When
Jarvan
III
of
Demacia
was
married
to
the
then
Lady
Catherine
Spiritmight
over
twenty-five
years
ago,
the
marriage
was
intended
to
first
and
foremost
bring
unity
to
two
of
the
most
powerful
political
forces
in
Demacia
–
the
Lightshields
and
the
Spiritmights.
Having
said
that,
it
should
be
no
surprise
that
Ashe
and
Tryndamere’s
marriage
is
one
based
on
the
mutual
respect
and
security
of
their
people.
Both
of
them
have
publicly
expressed
as
much.
Having
said
that,
who
is
to
say
where
this
marriage
may
take
the
King
and
Queen
of
Freljord?
There’s
little
doubt
in
my
mind
that
Ashe
and
Tryndamere
will
want
to
cement
the
legacy
of
their
actions
by
producing
an
heir.
This
is
especially
so
with
Princess
Sejani
actively
working
against
the
new
Freljord
royalty.
"I
am
a
bit
confused
about
the
role
of
a
summoner
in
the
League's
matches.
I
have
heard
from
several
sources
that
the
summoner
actually
has
full
control
of
their
champion
during
battle,
and
that
the
champions
simply
serve
as
ragdolls
for
the
magicians
to
manipulate.
Now,
here
in
Piltover
we
are
all
big
fans
of
Ezreal
,
or
"The
Prodigal
Explorer
"
as
many
of
us
call
him.
However,
the
thought
that
our
skillful
champion
may
not
actually
be
doing
any
of
the
fighting
himself
has
upset
a
great
deal
of
us.
Can
you
shed
some
light
on
these
concerning
rumors?"
--
Boush
Summoning
is
the
most
challenging
of
all
magical
disciplines.
There
is
far
more
to
it
than
simply
relocating
a
being
from
one
location
to
another.
A
summoner
mentally
and
physically
links
with
their
summoned
being
(champions,
as
we
call
them),
allowing
for
a
fluid
symbiosis.
A
champion
is
not
a
puppet
of
the
summoner;
instead,
the
champion
is
the
executor
of
the
will
of
the
summoner.
A
champion
is
in
full
control
of
themselves,
but
they
are
fully
aware
of
the
importance
and
the
necessity
of
the
summoner’s
will.
A
champion’s
duty
is
to
execute
the
will
of
a
summoner
with
the
utmost
precision
and
execution.
Bear
this
in
mind,
Boush:
a
champion
is
never
forced
to
be
a
part
of
a
battle
arena
where
their
loyalties
and
beliefs
are
not
considered.
During
matches
where
city-states
are
resolving
disputes,
a
champion
will
never
act
against
their
own
interests.
Garen
,
for
example,
would
never
charge
out
of
the
brush
at
a
fellow
Demacian
if
the
match
were
about
resolving
a
dispute
involving
Demacia.
"The
Ninth
Priest’s
question
intrigued
me.
If
the
Winter’s
Claw
tribe
were
to
join
Noxus,
would
not
Queen
Ashe
and
King
Tryndamere
go
to
Demacia
for
support?
If
this
were
to
happen,
would
the
league
be
capable
of
preventing
an
all
out
war?"
--
The
Lover
of
Pi
Oh,
but
were
it
that
easy
for
Freljord.
Demacia
and
the
people
that
now
make
up
Freljord
have
a
history
of
conflict,
albeit
nowhere
near
as
grievous
as
the
conflict
between
Noxus
and
Freljord.
Both
Ashe
and
Tryndamere
have
been
highly
critical
of
Demacia’s
neutrality
during
Noxus’
barbarian
pacification
campaigns.
In
fact,
Demacia
has
been
quite
protective
of
its
territory,
turning
away
refugees
during
the
campaign’s
more
bloody
episodes.
Likewise,
Demacia’s
northern
homesteads
have
more
than
once
been
a
target
of
barbarian
raiding
parties.
Both
city-states
have
a
lot
of
diplomatic
work
ahead
of
them
before
they
can
bridge
a
gap
that
spans
decades
of
distrust.
As
for
preventing
an
all
out
war,
the
League
will
take
whatever
actions
necessary
to
protect
its
client
city-states
from
all
threats
–
even
if
those
threats
are
from
the
city-states
themselves.

Madness,
people,
madness!
Only
yours
truly,
dedicated
reporter
Ram
Steed,
has
the
sheer
audacity
to
tell
you
how
it
is.
I
can't
even
tell
you
how
long
it's
been
since
my
last
report
–
time
is
a
blur!
What
I
can
promise
you
is
that
I
have
been
pounding

more

–

from

Sivir's
Vacation
Sure
she's
deadly.
She
wouldn't
still
have
the
title
“the
Battle
Mistress”
if
she
wasn't.
Sure
she's
survived
multiple
attempts
on
her
life
at
the
behest
of
the
Noxian
High
Command.
Sure
she's
hotter
than
a
summer
day
–
that
red
and
gold
outfit
certainly
provides
her
with
plenty
of
space
to
move.
Nevertheless,
our
lady
Sivir
may
have
come
up
against
a
force
she
won't
be
able
to
overcome!
For
those
whose
memory
is
less
than
stellar,
Sivir
was
arrested
last
October
after
going
for
an
alcohol-induced
joyride
in
a
hex-tech
conveyance,
terrorizing
her
two
passengers
and
a
host
of
pedestrians.
She
was
arrested
by
Demacian
authorities
shortly
afterwards,
if
you
remember
the
hype,
and
she
stood
trial
just
the
other
day.
Judge
Haley
Suede
took
pity
on
Sivir's
"I'm
just
a
lonely
girl
with
personal
problems"
defense
and
sentenced
the
Champion
to
90
days
in
a
Demacian
penitentiary,
with
time
spent
in
the
Fields
of
Justice
not
counting
towards
her
sentence.
Listen,
I
love
our
Champions
–
they
pay
my
bills
–
but
one
thing
I
can't
stand
is
the
way
they're
given
special
dispensation
by
the
courts.
If
I'd
done
the
same
thing,
I
would
be
in
jail
for
the
next
18
months,
and
not
in
a
cushy
part
of
the
prison.
Oh
well.
Position
has
its
privilege,
but
we'll
have
to
see
how
a
jail
term
interferes
with
her
duties
to
the
League
of
Legends.
More
on
this
as
it
develops.
Pads:
Missing
the
Mark
(Or
Was
the
Mark)
Last
week,
Zaun-based
entertainment
company
Northern
Exposure
launched
its
new
special
entitled
"Pads".
It
is
part
of
the
new
wave
of
crystal-recorded
shows,
which
use
the
newest
exciting
techmaturgy
for
personal
entertainment.
Pads
takes
viewers
into
the
homes
of
the
League's
favorite
Champions,
so
that
fans
can
see
how
they
live.
Personally,
this
reporter
feels
that
our
friends
at
Northern
Exposure
missed
the
mark
for
their
reality
show.
At
least
a
half-dozen
better
concepts
already
come
to
mind,
but
I
digress.
The
most
interesting
part
of
this
tale
is
the
subject
they
chose
for
their
first
show:
the
notorious
Dr.
Mundo.
Now,
what
would
possess
a
reasonable
individual
to
choose
the
Madman
of
Zaun
as
a
good
subject
to
record?
I'm
sure
there
was
a
little
hometown
pride
going
on
there
and,
honestly,
who
doesn't
want
to
see
that
guy's
lab?
The
Mundo
episode
was
produced
and
distributed
according
to
plan,
but
this
reporter
knows
a
few
things
that
he
must
expose!
The
episode
was
heavily
edited
and
censored.
Apparently
the
Noxian
government
wouldn't
let
it
air
as
they
originally
captured
it.
You
can
guess
why.
Several
members
of
the
crew
went
“missing”
during
the
production
and
have
yet
to
be
found.
Their
families
have
been
given
settlements
by
the
Noxian
government,
and
investigations
into
their
whereabouts
have
ceased.
If
Northern
Lights
keeps
making
these
kinds
of
decisions,
Pads
will
be
a
short-lived
show,
as
will
the
company
itself.
Dear
Mr.
Steed
I
suppose
it's
no
surprise
that
I
get
a
lot
of
mail
from
people.
It
just
hasn't
felt
right
keeping
it
to
myself,
so
I've
decided
to
expand
my
column
to
share
with
you
some
of
the
good,
the
bad,
and
the
ugly
that
both
fans
and
haters
have
taken
the
time
to
write
to
me.
Here's
this
issue's
letter:
"Dear
Mr.
Steed
–
The
reason
I
write
is
regarding
the
articles
concerning
the
private
life
and
bedroom
activities
of
Janna
.
While
humorous
to
some,
the
effects
of
healthy
bedroom
activities
might
actually
be
rather
beneficial.
I
have
recently
done
research
on
the
topic,
sparked
by
a
letter
from
a
fellow
summoner
speculating
on
the
matter.
The
research
included
no
less
than
three
champions
of
the
League
who
have
requested
to
remain
anonymous,
but
the
immediate
result
states
that
such
activities
can
actually
provide
a
short
term
boost
to
magical
capabilities.
I
intend
to
send
a
journal
containing
some
of
my
conclusions
and
results
in
more
detail
to
the
relevant
League
officials,
regarding
Janna's
current
situation."
–
Munchlord,
Zaunite
Summoner
and
Independent
Researcher
First
off,
I'm
glad
you
found
my
work
concerning
this
matter
a
source
of
enjoyment
for
you.
It's
always
nice
when
readers
hide
their
compliments
amongst
their
justifications.
Second
off,
Munchlord,
how
long
have
you
been
on
Janna's
public
relations
payroll?
Seriously.
Bedroom
activities
leading
to
boosts
in
magical
abilities?
Like
Janna's
getting
down
to
be
a
better
Champion
for
the
people?
Nice
try,
my
friend,
but
this
smacks
of
some
serious
propaganda.
For
you
folks
at
home,
this
is
the
kind
of
hype
you
can
expect
to
see
whenever
a
Champion
gets
themselves
into
the
kind
of
embarrassing
trouble
that
Janna's
most
recently
found
herself
in.
There
are
always
“experts”
who
will
come
to
the
rescue,
so
that
what
might
otherwise
be
identified
as
questionable
behavior
can
be
dismissed
without
further
thought.
You
be
the
judge.
Regardless,
thanks
to
Munchlord
for
writing
in!
If
you've
got
something
to
say
to
Ram
Steed,
mail
me
personally
at
the
Journal.
Some
infernal
techmaturgical
machine
will
get
your
message
and
pass
it
on
to
me.
