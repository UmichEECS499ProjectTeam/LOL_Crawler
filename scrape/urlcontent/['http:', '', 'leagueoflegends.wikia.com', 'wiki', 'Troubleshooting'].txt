"Please
help
improve

I
dumped

in
the
hope
that

The
only
thing
I
ask
is
that
this

maintained
somewhere.
The
original

and
you
should
also
check
out
Riot's

which
I
hope
this

Lastly
this

was
written
in
first/second

so...
changing
it
to

would
be

Most
likely
cause
2:
An
app
called
airfoil
conflicting
with
FMOD
somehow.
Solution:
Uninstalling
Airfoil
can
resolve
the
issue.
Note:
Air
Foil
sometimes
performs
fine
and
sometimes
doesn't
cause
problems.
"Backstory
on
this:
When
looking
through
some
of
the
logs
I
noted
that
AirfoilInct3.dll
(from
the
Air
foil
product)
was
causing
problems
for
some
users.
We
tried
reproducing
this
in
the
office
by
installing
the
product,
but
we
were
unsuccessful.
One
very
helpful
user
left
his
email
so
I
was
able
to
contact
him.
He
experimented
with
disabling
and
uninstalling
the
product.
Uninstalling
can
be
done
without
a
restart
and
it
is
possible
to
re-install
the
product
afterwards.
We
will
keep
looking
for
a
more
permanent
fix
for
this."
(hohums)
Moral:
Please
leave
your
summoner
name
and
email
address
in
the
bugsplat
so
that
Hohums
can
get
in
touch
with
you
if
necessary.
A
Player
jumps
around
or
goes
very
fast
(i.e.
a
timing
issue)
Most
likely
cause:
AMD
CPU
bug.
Solution:
Latest
motherboard/cpu
drivers
can
fix
this
or
"AMD
Dual
Core
Optimizer"
or
setting
the
affinity
of
the
game
to
use
1
cpu.
To
set
the
affinity:
Open
Task
Manager
(accessed
by
using
ctrl+shift+escape
or
ctrl+alt+delete
in
Windows)
Right
click
on
the
League
of
Legends
process
(not
the
launcher)
while
the
game
is
running
Click
"set
affinity"
and
select
only
one
cpu.
You'll
need
to
do
that
every
time.
Game
doesn't
start,
every
time
(not
once
in
a
few
games)
Most
likely
cause:
The
graphics
card
does
not
support
shader
2.0.
Explanation:
Geforce
5
is
the
lowest
Nvidia
card
League
of
Legends
supports
which
has
shader
2.0.
For
ATi
(AMD)
graphics
cards,
League
of
Legends
supports
any
in
the
series
9500+
or
any
Xxxx
after
and
including
the
X300.
However,
performance
wise
these
cards
are
at
the
low
end
(9500
/
x800
is
the
recommended
minimum).
Game
runs
slow,
slow
input
for
menus,
scrolling
etc...
Most
likely
cause
1:
Integrated
graphics
card.
Explanation:
These
cards
may
support
shader
2.0,
but
are
normally
cut
down
versions
of
their
dedicated
counterparts.
They
also
share
memory
with
the
system.
Riot
can
identify
these
cards
by
looking
in
either
the
r3dlog
or
dxdiag
for
the
video
card.
To
identify
your
video
card:
Go
to
start
menu
click
Run...,
type
in
dxdiag
hit
Enter.
Hit
Yes
if
you're
presented
with
a
choice
dialog
box.
When
the
window
comes
up,
go
to
the
Display
Tab
and
look
under
Device
field
for
the
information.
Use
google
or
manufacturer
website
to
identify
whether
the
card
is
integrated
or
not.
If
you
can't
identify
if
your
card
is
integrated
or
dedicated
by
searching
google,
send
in
r3dlog
and
dxdiag
files
to
the
Riot
Help
&
Support
forum
so
the
community
can
identify
it
for
you.
Riot
plans
to
do
more
work
on
optimizing
integrated
graphics
cards
and
cpu,
however,
if
you
want
the
game
to
run
better,
newer
video
cards
that
will
support
LOL
can
be
bought
for
about
$50;
although
some
laptops
can't
be
upgraded.
Likely
cause
2:
You
may
have
a
virus
scanner
or
software
firewall
such
as
Mcafee
or
Norton
slowing
down
your
machine.
Explanation:
Some
virus
scanners
mess
with
the
network
even
when
turned
off
and
also
slow
down
memory
access.
Riot
has
reports
that
indicate
upgrading
the
virus
scanner
to
the
latest
version
available
from
the
website
solves
this
problem
(Mcafee
in
particular).
Other
than
that
the
only
available
solution
is
to
turn
antivirus
off,
removing
it
from
the
Task
Manager
when
running
the
game.
Also,
there
may
be
other
particular
software
in
the
background
that
can
take
up
cpu
time.
It
is
suggested
closing
everything
you
can
and
also
updating
to
the
latest
drivers
and
windows
updates.
See
Game
Booster
for
possible
solutions.
Likely
cause
3:
Your
power
scheme
may
be
set
to
energy-saving
mode.
Explanation:
This
mode
allows
the
windows
to
slow
down
the
CPU
when
it
is
not
necessary
to
use
all
the
power
of
the
processor.
At
times,
however,
this
energy-saving
mode,
which
shouldn't
kick
in
during
the
gameplay,
forces
the
CPU
to
slow
down.
This
problem
seems
to
be
occurring
more
frequently
with
later
OS
with
advanced
power
options.
Solution:
change
the
power
scheme
before
you
join
the
queue
Win
XP:
Control
Panel->Power
Options->Change
the
Power
Scheme
to
"Always
On"->Press
OK
at
the
bottom.
Win
7/Vista:
Control
Panel->Look
at
the
top
of
the
Control
Panel
window
and
click
the
drop-down
arrow
next
to
the
"Control
Panel"
button->Click
'Show
All
Items'->Power
Options->Click
"Performance"
power
scheme.
Join
the
queue.
Also,
there
may
be
other
particular
software
in
the
background
that
can
take
up
cpu
time.
It
is
suggested
closing
everything
you
can
and
also
updating
to
the
latest
drivers
and
windows
updates.
See
Game
Booster
for
possible

Resolution
-
This
is
your
most
important
weapon
with

The
lower
the
resolution
the
better
the
game
will
run.
(unfortunately
Riot
doesn't
allow
much
choice
here)
Shut
down
as
many
processes
as
possible
that
you
do
not
need
(game
booster
can
do
this).
Run
a
anti-virus/spyware
(spybot
is
a
good
app).
Defrag
your
hard
drive.
Defragging
it
on
bootup
works
best
(
http://samanathon.com/registry-hack-how-to-defragment-your-hard-drive-on-boot/
).
After
defrag
set
your
virtual
memory
to
3GBs
(or
at
least
2GB).
That
way
it
will
not
automatically
resize
and
fragment
when
it
runs
out.
Update
to
the
latest
drivers
for
everything
on
your
system.
Driver
Detective
can
detect
what
drivers
you
have
out
of
date,
but
its
not
free
to
download
them.
You
can
find
them
yourself.
Also
update
to
the
latest
Windows
Updates.
Overclocking
your
CPU/memory
and
graphics
card
can
help
although
overclocking
it
too
much
can
cause
instability
due
to
overheating.
You'd
want
to
research
your
hardware
to
see
what
is
possible
and
then
experiment.
Keep
in
mind,
you
can
damage
your
hardware
components
when
you
try
overclocking,
therefore,
do
so
at
your
own
risk.
(Wikia
and
Riot
do
not
take
any
responsibility
for
any
damage
incurred
to
the
hardware
if
the
user
attempts
overclocking).
Check
out
how
your
video
card
ranks
on
this
page:
Video
Card
Ranks
.
If
you're
on
the
low
end
list,
you're
probably
going
to
need
to
run
on
lowest
settings
/
resolution
to
get
decent
performance.
They
also
provide
two
free
benchmarking
tools
which
may
allow
you
to
figure
out
what
is
slow
on
your
system:
BurnIn
Test
.
Lastly
theres
a
program
called
Game
Booster
which
shuts
down
everything,
but
the
game
and
can
make
the
game
run
at
higher
fps.

game.
Windows
comes
with
a
firewall
however
the
launcher
registers
itself
during
patching
to
let
it
know
that
LOL
is
a
good
app.
However
some
firewalls
(most
often
these
come
with
virus
scanners)
will
not
let
LOL
connect
unless
you
explicitly
add
lol.launcher.exe
and
Game\League
of
Legends.exe
to
it.
Also
it
can
be
important
to
isolate
the
problem.
If
you're
running
though
a
router
try
plugging
directly
into
the
modem.
Sometimes
rebooting
the
modem
and/or
router
can
actually
help
speed
up
connections
particularly
if
it
hasn't
been
rebooted
for
a
while.
(Unplug
the
router/modem
for
about
10
seconds
and
plug
it
back
in)

and
can't
connect
even
when
your
friends
are,
I
got
an
email
from
a
riot
employee,
and
basically
the
fix
goes
as
follows:
Resync
your
clock
with
an
internet
time
server,
and
make
sure
it
successfully
re-syncs
or
pick
one
that
does
if
it
doesn't,
right-click
on
your
clock,
adjust
date/time,
move
to
the
internet
time
tab
-
change
settings
-
resync
to
your
current
clock,
pick
a
new
server
if
that
one
doesn't
do
it
correctly.
Properly

make
sure
its
updated
to
IE

)

Uncheck
"Check

If
you
have
a
more
updated
version
of
Internet
Explorer
you
may
have
to
uncheck
these
settings
instead:
"Check
for
server

"Check
for
publisher's

revocation"
"Warn
about

Deactivate
Peer
to

in
the
LoL
Client.
You
can
do
this
by
clicking
the
Gear
Icon
in
the
top
right
of
the
LoL
Patcher.
Now
Deselect
"Allow
Peer

Uninstall

Add/Remove

Control

Black
screen
after
changing
the
resolution,
can't
change
it
back
Solution:
You
can
try
to
manually
edit
the
settings
file
to
get
the
game
back
to
original
resolution
it
was
working
at.
To
do
so:
Navigate
to
League
of
Legends->Game->DATA->CFG->defaults
(by
default
C:\League
of
Legends\game\DATA\CFG\defaults\Game.cfg)
Open
Game.CFG
with
a
text
editor
like
Notepad.
First
few
lines
will
state
the
resolution
in
Height
and
Width,
change
the
numbers
to
proper
resolution
and
save
the
file.
What
are
the
ports?
Since
we
are
not
P2P
the
ports
are
opened
on
the
servers'
end,
so
most
of
the
time
the
ports
on
your
typical
router
won't
need
to
be
opened
with
the
default
setup.
However,
sometimes
these
will
be
blocked
as
well
(mostly
at
universities
and
businesses,
that
want
to
block
certain
activities).
The
incoming
ports
are:
Ports
TCP
2099
and
5299
Ports
UDP
5000-5200
The
other
option
is
to
use
a
tunneling
app
that
bounces
off
another
machine
(perhaps
your
home
machine)
into
a
port
that
is
supported.
This
may
increase
lag.

the

but

all...
Can
LOL
run
on
Linux?
Yes
it
can
on
WINE.
While
there
are
a
couple
of
issues
on
WINE
it
is
playable.
