PVP.net
V1.25.93
Improved
Leaver
Buster
-
PVP.net
will
now
automatically
ban
leavers.
This
works
similar
to
a
'driving
points"
system
for
driver's
licenses.
You
gain
‘leave
points’
by
leaving
games,
and
if
you
have
enough
leave
points,
you
will
be
suspended
or
banned.
You
lose
‘leave
points’
by
having
good
behavior
–
by
completing
your
games,
and
not
leaving
over
a
long
period
of
time.
Mastery
saving
has
been
improved:
Respeccing
your
masteries
no
longer
saves
an
empty
mastery
page
to
the
server.
This
means
you’ll
never
accidentally
enter
the
game
with
no
masteries.
You
can
now
remove
saved
mastery
points
individually
without
having
to
return
all
your
points.
When
you
have
unsaved
changes
in
your
rune
page
or
mastery
page,
you
will
now
be
prompted
to
save
when
navigating
away.
Lowered
the
volume
level
of
audio
in
PVP.net
at
all
slider
positions.
You
may
want
to
adjust
the
audio
levels
in
PVP.net
as
a
result.
Fixed
a
bug
where
viewing
another
users
Champions
would
display
your
own
Champions
instead.
This
option
is
now
greyed
out
when
viewing
another
users
profile.
Fixed
a
bug
where
the
"Play
Again"
button
would
not
work
at
the
End
of
Game
screen
for
arranged
teams.
Fixed
a
bug
where
you
could
not
select
the
"Random"
marker
in
Champion
Selection.
Fixed
a
bug
where
PVP.net
would
crash
at
certain
resolutions.
