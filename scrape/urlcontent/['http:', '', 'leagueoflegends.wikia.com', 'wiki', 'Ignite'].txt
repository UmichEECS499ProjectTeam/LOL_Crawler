Strategy
Ignite
affords
players
an
offensive
utility
and
damage
spell
that
scales
with
level.
Throughout
Season
2
and
Season
3,
it
was
a
popular
spell
among
summoners
for
its
focused
and
aggressive
nature,
and
in
Season
4
it
has
risen
as
a
popular
spell
for
supports
to
provide
additional
kill
potential.
A
well-placed
healing
reduction
debuff
from
Ignite
can
severely
limit
the
effectiveness
of
enemy
healing
items,
as
well
as
healing
abilities
from
champions
like
Soraka
,
Vladimir
,
and
Warwick
.
This
also
applies
to
life
steal
and
spell
vamp
effects
from
items
and
abilities
such
as
The
Bloodthirster
and
Morgana's
Soul
Siphon
.
Furthermore,
Ignite's
true
damage
pierces
fully
through
armor
and
magic
resist
,
and
is
not
mitigated
by
damage
reduction.
This
makes
Ignite
an
effective
counter
to
mitigation-based
items
and
abilities
like
the
defensive
stats
from
Guardian
Angel
and
Garen's
Courage
.
Notes
Cleanse
removes
the
damage
over
time
component
of
Ignite
,
but
not
the
healing
reduction.
The
healing
debuff
from
Ignite
does
not
reduce
the
amount
of
temporary
health
gained
from
shields
like
Barrier
and
Janna's
Eye
of
the
Storm
or
maximum
health
boosts
such
as
Elixir
of
Fortitude
and
Lulu's
Wild
Growth
.
Multiple
uses
of
Ignite
on
the
same
target
will
not
stack.
A
second
application
of
Ignite
on
the
target
will
refresh
the
duration
of
its
effect,
but
will
not
provide
any
added
damage
or
healing
reduction.
The
healing
debuff
from
Ignite
does
not
stack
with
any
other
abilities
that
apply
a
healing
debuff,
such
as
Miss
Fortune's
Impure
Shots
.
Casting
ignite
does
not
interrupt
channeling
spells,
e.g.
Malzahar's
Nether
Grasp
When
channeling
a
spell
and
you
want
to
Ignite
make
sure
the
target
is
within
Ignite
range.
If
you
cast
Ignite
while
channeling
a
spell
like
Malzahar's
Nether
Grasp
while
the
target
is
out
of
range
of
your
Ignite
your
champion
will
break
his/her
spell
channel
and
move
towards
the
enemy
champion
to
cast
Ignite
.
Ignite
ing
a
recalling
Enemy
won't
stop
his
Recall,
although
he
gets
damaged.
as
of
5/6/2013.
Trivia
The
icon
for
Ignite
shows
a
great
resemblance
to
Annie's
Pyromania
since
they
are
both
icons
of
a
hand
holding
a
flame.
