Crystalline
Flask
is
a
consumable
item
in
League
of
Legends
.
[1]
Notes
The
active
cannot
be
used
simultaneously
with
Health
Potion
and
Mana
Potion
.
The
sell
value
of
this
item
is
40%
of
the
total
cost.
Compared
to
potions
each
charge
is
worth
49
gold
(28
for
health
and
21
for
mana)
or
53.
9
gold
(30.
8
for
health
and
23.
1
for
mana)
when
using
the
Alchemist
mastery.
Assuming
you
eventually
sell
it,
Crystalline
Flask
breaks
even
with
regular
potions
once
a
champion
consumes
4.
22
charges.
When
only
considering
health,
it
pays
off
at
7.
375
charges.
When
only
considering
mana
it
takes
9.
86
charges.
When
using
the
Alchemist
mastery
the
flask
pays
of
at
3.
84
charges
considering
both
health
and
mana,
or
at
6.
72
charges
considering
only
health.
Finally
considering
only
mana
the
flask
pays
of
at
8.
96
charges.
Health
regeneration
speed
is
the
same
as
a
potion
(10
health/s),
while
mana
regeneration
speed
is
a
bit
lower
(5
MP/s
vs.
6.
7
MP/s).
Although
many
people
might
not
compare
this
item
to
a
combination
of
Faerie
Charm
and
Rejuvenation
Bead
,
it
would
take
five
minutes
(180/.6)
to
get
the
same
mana
regen,
and
six
minutes
to
get
the
same
health
regen
(360/1),
per
set
of
3
charges.
Furthermore,
unlike
Faerie
Charm
and
Rejuvenation
Bead,
which
are
absolutely
useless
while
you
have
full
or
no
health/mana,
you
can
choose
to
use
charges
as
long
as
you
have
them.
Trivia
Crystalline
Flask
closely
resembles
DotA's
Bottle
.
You
are
unable
to
use
flask
charges
at
the
spawning
pool
when
you
are
at
full
health.
If
you
return
to
the
spawning
pool
with
stacks
still
ticking
they
are
removed
upon
entering.
