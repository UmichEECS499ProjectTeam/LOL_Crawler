Starting
gold
Gold
is
the
in-game
currency
of
League
of
Legends
.
It
is
used
to
buy
items
in
the
shop
that
provide
champions
with
bonus
stats
and
abilities,
which
in
turn
is
one
of
the
main
ways
for
champions
to
increase
their
power
over
the
course
of
a
game.
At
the
beginning
of
the
game,
champions
are
given
starting
gold
based
on
the
map
being
played
on,
and
can
receive
more
gold
through
various
means.
Actively,
champions
acquire
gold
through
last
hitting
minions
and
monsters
,
destroying
enemy
turrets
,
and
killing
enemy
champions
(or
assisting
in
kills).
Champions
also
passively
generate
gold,
which
can
be
increased
by
runes
,
masteries
,
and
items.
Passive
gold
gain
does
not
activate
until
minions
spawn.

Starting
Gold
Champions
start
with
475
gold
on
Summoner's
Rift
,
825
on
Twisted
Treeline
,
and
1375
on
Crystal
Scar
and
Howling
Abyss
.
The
Wealth
mastery
increases
starting
gold
by
40,
allowing
more
potential
combinations
of
items
or
an
additional
Health
or
Mana
Potion
.
Passive
Gold
Gain
Gold
earned
automatically,
without
requiring
direct
action
from
the
player,
is
considered
passive
gold
gain.
It
is
typically
quantified
in
terms
of
the
amount
of
gold
gained
over
10
seconds
("gold
per
10"
for
short).
Passive
gold
gain
can
be
increased
by
runes,
masteries,
and
gold-generating
items.
Base
Gold
Generation
Every
champion
passively
generates
gold
at
a
rate
that
varies
from
map
to
map.
This
gold
gain
does
not
begin
until
minions
spawn
(or
on
Crystal
Scar,
at
1:30).
Summoner's
Rift
:
19
gold
per
10
seconds.
Twisted
Treeline
:
16
gold
per
10
seconds.
Howling
Abyss
:
44
gold
per
10
seconds.
Crystal
Scar
:
56
gold
per
10
seconds.
Items
Avarice
Blade
generates
3
gold
per
10
seconds.
Note
that
this
is
the
only
gold-generating
item
without
the
Gold
Income
passive
,
meaning
it
can
be
purchased
alongside
any
other
gold-generating
item.
Gold

Items

gold
every
10
seconds.

Active
Gold
Gain
Gold
that
is
earned
through
direct
action
from
the
player
is
considered
active
gold
gain.
It
can
be
increased
by
runes,
masteries,
and
items.
Killing
Minions,
Monsters,
and
Pets
Gold
can
be
earned
by
dealing
the
killing
blow
("last
hit")
to
enemy
minions
and
neutral
monsters.
The
gold
earned
from
minion
kills
is
dependent
on
the
game
time.
As
the
game
progresses,
each
minion
is
worth
more.
The
gold
earned
from
neutral
monsters
also
increases
over
time,
depending
on
when
the
monsters
were
spawned.
In
addition,
the
largest
monster
in
a
minor
camp
will
slowly
increase
its
gold
value
to
a
modest
cap
after
approximately
two
minutes.
Pets
and
summons
such
as
Annie's
Tibbers
,
Malzahar's
Voidling
,
Shaco's
Jack
In
The
Box
,
and
Zyra's
Thorn
Spitter
grant
gold
to
the
champion
who
kills
them.
Certain
epic
monsters
give
gold
globally,
providing
gold
for
the
entire
team.
The
champion
who
lands
the
killing
blow
receives
an
additional
25
gold.
Champion
Kills
and
Assists
Gold
can
be
earned
by
killing
enemy
champions.
The
gold
gain
associated
with
a
champion
kill
is
determined
by
how
many
kills
the
slain
champion
has
recently
accumulated
(champions
that
have
killed
many
enemies
without
dying
are
worth
more
gold).
When
a
champion
is
killed,
the
bounty
ranges
from
15
to
500
gold
[1]
.
The
last
hitter
always
receives
100%
of
the
value
of
the
bounty.
An
extra
50%
of
the
value
of
the
bounty
is
put
into
a
gold
pool.
This
pool
is
split
equally
among
all
champions
who
assisted
in
the
kill
in
the
past
10
seconds
(either
by
damaging
or
debuffing
the
slain
champion,
or
by
healing
or
buffing
the
killing
champion).
If
there
are
no
assists,
this
pool
is
lost.
An
extra
100
gold
is
earned
for
getting
First
Blood,
the
first
kill
in
a
game.
Destroying
Structures
Whenever
an
enemy
turret
is
destroyed,
every
team
member
receives
between
100
and
175
gold.
Members
who
contributed
to
the
turret
kill
split
an
additional
0
to
150
gold.
Destroying
an
inhibitor
or
nexus
grants
the
player
50
gold,
but
the
latter
is
irrelevant
as
it
also
causes
the
game
to
end.
Destroying
Wards
Destroying
a
Sight
Ward
or
a
Vision
Ward
will
grant
the
player
15
gold.
An
additional
15
gold
is
granted
to
the
champion
who
provided
true
sight
to
reveal
the
ward,
if
necessary.
This
means
that
revealing
and
destroying
a
ward
grants
a
player
30
gold
in
total.
Items
Avarice
Blade
grants
2
bonus
gold
