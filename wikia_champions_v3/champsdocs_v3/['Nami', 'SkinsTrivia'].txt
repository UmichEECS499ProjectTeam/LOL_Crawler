Trivia
Nami
was
designed
by
Classick
.
[1]
Nami
was
originally
going
to
be
named
after
Classick
as
"Romlariel",
but
this
was
decided
against.
[2]
The
name
"
Nami
"
(波)
has
several
different
meanings
in
Japanese,
but
is
commonly
translated
as
"wave,"
as
in
ocean
waves.
The
name
"Nami"
is
also
a
component
for
the
term
"
tsunami
"
(津波)
which
was
borrowed
from
Japanese
vocabulary.
Nami's
concept
and
"people"
(The
Marai)
are
inspired
by
the
mermaid,
a
mythical
creature,
typically
related
to
the
sea.
The
tiny
sharks
in
Nami's
joke
are
visually
similar
to
the
Pressman
Toy
Corporation
board
game
Let's
Go
Fishin'
.
Nami's
lore
draws
some
parallels
with
the
Dinotopia
series,
where
the
safety
of
a
fictional
utopia
was
owed
to
the
power
of
"sunstones".
As
part
of
the
story,
the
last
of
the
sunstones
were
dying
and
the
only
known
remaining
supply
resided
beneath
the
ocean.
Nami's
ability,
Ebb
and
Flow
,
is
a
reference
to
the
movement
of
water,
often
in
relation
to
natural
tides.
Nami's
passive
ability,
Surging
Tides
,
was
originally
named
"Celerity".
[3]
Nami's
first
ability,
Aqua
Prison
,
was
originally
named
"Hydro
Blast".
[3]
Nami's
second
ability,
Ebb
and
Flow
,
was
originally
named
"Surging
Tides",
which
is
now
the
name
of
her
passive,
Surging
Tides
.
[3]
Nami's
third
ability,
Tidecaller's
Blessing
,
was
originally
named
"Aqueous
Empowerment".
[3]
If
you
search
the
item
shop
for
'hat'
while
playing
Nami,
you
will
find
Boots
of
Speed
.
This
is
a
reference
to
The
Little
Mermaid
.
Skins
Nami's
eyes
were
originally
red
in
her
classic
art
but
was
later
changed
to
orange-yellow.
On
Nami's
in-game
model,
her
eyes
are
still
pinkish
red.
Nami's
helmet
in
her
classic
art
is
black,
but
in
game
her
helmet
is
distinctly
purple.
Koi
Nami
based
on
the
Japanese
koi
(鯉)
of
the
same
name.
When
Koi
Nami
does
her
joke,
three
koi
are
called
out
during
the
animation
instead
of
three
tiny
sharks.
Koi
Nami
has
koi
fish
animations
applied
to
all
of
her
skills
except
Aqua
Prison
.
Koi
also
means
'love'
in
Japanese
if
written
as
恋.
This
may
refer
to
her
nature
as
a
support
or
her
love
for
her
people.
Quotes
Nami's
quotes,
"Let
the
seas
reclaim
them,"
and
"We
are
all
tied
to
the
ocean,"
are
references
to
the
theory
that
all
life
came
from
the
ocean.
The
"Eww,
whale
breath,"
quote
is
a
reference
to
Ambergris
,
a
component
of
perfume
which
is
a
substance
produced
in
the
digestive
system
of
sperm
whales
.
In
short,
the
smell
of
perfume
is
the
smell
of
whale's
puke
to
her.
Nami
shares
a
quote
with
Gragas
:
"Have
a
drink"
Relations
The
Ghost
Viking's
quote
to
Nami
;
"Sorry,
fresh
out
of
moonstones."
might
mean
that
the
moonstones
came
from
the
Howling
Abyss,
and
that
the
moonstone
bearer
had
taken
the
last
one
already.
He
could
also
just
be
taunting
her
and
her
people's
hardships
in
delivering
said
moonstone
to
its
intended
target.
