Background

&
Trivia
Skill
usage
While
some
might
have
played
manaless
champions
before,
Renekton's
Fury
resource
(shared
with
Tryndamere
and
Shyvana
)
can
catch
many
players
who
are
unfamiliar
with
Renekton
off-guard.
While
he
needs
fury
to
enhance
his
abilities,
he
does
not
need
it
to
cast
them.
Try
to
use
this
to
your
advantage.
Cull
the
Meek
heals
more
when
an
enemy
champion
is
hit;
try
to
use
this
to
your
advantage.
Empowered
Cull
the
Meek
grants
excellent
lane
sustain
thanks
to
its
increased
damage
and
healing
cap.
Take
advantage
of
this
by
building
fury,
then
hitting
as
many
enemy
minions
as
once
to
greatly
increase
your
health
gain.
Keep
in
mind
that
the
normal
version
of
Cull
the
Meek
grants
fury
while
the
empowered
version
does
not.
Ruthless
Predator
resets
the
attack
timer
after
usage,
resulting
in
a
possible
fourth
attack.
Keep
in
mind
that
Renekton
is
not
able
to
move
while
hitting
with
Ruthless
Predator
.
Slice
and
Dice
has
a
number
of
great
uses
thanks
to
its
mobility.
When
you
need
to
make
a
quick
escape,
use
Slice
and
Dice
into
a
minion
wave
or
champion.
This
will
trigger
the
secondary
effect,
allowing
you
to
use
it
again
and
clear
distance
very
quickly.
When
moving
through
the
jungle,
you
can
use
Slice
and
Dice
to
go
through
some
walls.
Ideally,
try
to
Slice
through
walls
where
you
will
hit
a
monster
camp
on
the
other
side,
allowing
you
to
cast
Dice
for
increased
chasing
or
escaping
effectiveness.
Slice
and
Dice
can
be
used
to
harass
enemies
who
have
their
abilities
on
cooldown
.
Slice
in,
land
a
few
hits,
and
Dice
back
out
of
range
in
time
before
the
enemy
champion
has
time
to
react
properly.
Remember
that
the
second,
not
the
first,
dash
of
Slice
and
Dice
with
loaded
Fury
will
activate
the
bonus.
Slice
and
Dice
in
combination
with
Ruthless
Predator
is
good
for
attacking
ranged
champions,
since
Slice
and
Dice
gets
you
close
while
Ruthless
Predator
stuns
the
target.
Once
again,
make
sure
you
slice
through
minions
or
champions
so
you
can
dice
the
rest
of
the
way
if
needed.
Slice
and
Dice
provides
excellent
mobility
for
dodging
skill
shots
in
lane.
When
you
see
an
enemy
lining
one
up
Slice
through
nearby
minions
out
of
the
way,
and
then
activate
Dice
to
further
re-position
yourself.
Although
they
aren't
on-next-attack
abilities,
Cull
the
Meek
and
Slice
and
Dice
also
reset
Renekton's
autoattack
timer.
Try
to
weave
all
his
abilities
in
between
autoattacks
to
increase
your
DPS
substantially.
These
autoattacks
also
generate
fury,
so
do
not
neglect
them!
Dominus
increases
the
range
of
Cull
the
Meek
â€“
use
this
to
your
advantage
in
team
fights.
Dominus
allows
Renekton
to
easily
win
duels
thanks
to
its
mix
of
instant
health
gain,
damage,
and
Fury
gain,
allowing
him
to
make
sudden
comebacks.
If
both
you
and
your
opponent
are
low
on
health
and
Dominus
is
available
try
to
lure
them
in
and
use
it
to
get
an
easily
kill.
Renekton
can
jungle
with
Reign
of
Anger
and
Cull
the
Meek
.
Deciding
how
to
use
Renekton's
fury
bonus
on
abilities
is
very
important.
The
added
heal
from
Cull
the
Meek
can
help
you
sustain
better
in
lane
or
in
the
jungle.
A
increased
stun
from
Ruthless
Predator
will
lock
down
an
enemy
longer
when
pursuing
or
escaping.
The
armor
reduction
from
Slice
and
Dice
is
increases
physical
damage
dealt
by
yourself
and
the
rest
of
your
team.
By
activating
Ruthless
Predator
during
a
dash
from
Slice
and
Dice's
and
selecting
a
champion
as
your
next
basic
attack,
you
can
dash
into
an
enemy
and
stun
them
immediately.
Build
usage
Renekton
is
a
tanky
attack
damage
caster,
relying
on
health
and
resistances
to
sustain
himself
in
teamfights
and
cooldown
reduction
to
maintain
his
fury.
Damage
Hexdrinker
and
Maw
of
Malmortius
are
strong
items
on
Renekton
,
providing
additional
damage
and
durability
against
magic
damage
.
Maw
of
Malmortius
scales
very
well
with
Renekton
's
passive,
Reign
of
Anger
,
due
to
increased
fury
generation
while
also
having
an
additional
20+
AD
when
below
50%
life
,
increasing
all
damage
output
significantly.
The
combination
of
The
Black
Cleaver
and
Ruthless
Predator
,
which
triggers
on-hit
effects
,
can
give
the
target
3
stacks
of
the
armor
reduction
debuff
almost
instantly.
Using
this
at
the
beginning
of
a
fight
can
decide
its
outcome.
Last
Whisper
can
be
more
effective
if
his
enemies
have
built
a
significant
amount
of
armor
.
It
works
well
regardless
of
whether
Renekton
uses
the
fury
empowered
Slice
and
Dice
.
If
you
are
having
problems
sustaining
yourself
with
Cull
the
Meek
alone,
The
Bloodthirster
/
Blade
of
the
Ruined
King
synergize
well
as
their
effects
proc
on
all
three
hits
of
Ruthless
Predator
.
Ravenous
Hydra
can
be
an
acceptable
alternative
to
The
Bloodthirster
.
The
area
of
effect
adds
to
the
other
AoEs
that
Renekton
already
has
and
the
active
can
be
used
to
cancel
the
animation
of
Ruthless
Predator
which
tends
to
undesirably
hold
Renekton
in
place.
Boots
Mercury's
Treads
are
the
standard
boots
for
Renekton
,
as
he
is
required
to
be
in
the
middle
of
skirmishes
and
thus
will
be
often
afflicted
with
crowd
control
.
Ninja
Tabi
are
good
if
laning
against
physical
damage
champions,
such
as
Riven
or
Garen
.
Ionian
Boots
of
Lucidity
grants
cooldown
reduction
,
which
is
a
valuable
stat
on
Renekton.
However,
this
item
is
only
recommended
if
Renekton
is
snowballing
or
the
team
is
tanky
enough
and
needs
more
damage.
Health
Randuin's
Omen
is
a
good
defensive
item,
offering
armor
,
health
and
a
movement
speed
slow.
Sunfire
Cape
is
a
very
useful
item
on
Renekton
as
it
synergizes
well
with
his
ultimate,
adding
even
more
AoE
magic
damage
.
It
is
also
easier
for
Renekton
to
get
into
the
middle
of
the
enemy
champions
due
to
his
Slice
and
Dice
.
Phage
gives
Renekton
some
much
needed
health
,
as
he
is
pretty
squishy
without
items
early
and
mid
game.
Frozen
Mallet
is
a
very
good
item
for
Renekton
as
its
movement
speed
slow
allows
him
to
stay
in
range
and
constantly
use
his
abilities.
Cooldown
Reduction
Spirit
Visage
can
be
a
very
good
item
when
using
Cull
the
Meek
,
since
it
boosts
all
healing
effects
by
20%
and
giving
Renekton
some
needed
cooldown
reduction
.
Zephyr
is
a
good
item
for
Renekton
as
it
provides
AD
,
attack
speed
,
movement
speed
and
most
importantly
provides
Tenacity
which
allows
him
to
use
boots
other
than
Mercury's
Treads
even
when
playing
against
champions
with
a
lot
of
crowd
control
.
The
Black
Cleaver
is
a
great
item
for
Renekton.
It
gives
attack
damage
,
cooldown
reduction
,
armor
penetration
and
a
stacking
armor
reduction
passive.
Therefore,
The
Brutalizer
is
an
essential
core
item
on
many
Renekton
players,
granting
early
AD
and
CDR.

Countering
Renekton
has
an
extremely
strong
laning
phase
and
very
high
early
game
damage
because
of
the
high
base
damage
his
abilities
have,
especially
their
Fury
Empowered
versions.
On
the
other
hand,
despite
his
strong
early
game
power,
Renekton
is
highly
vulnerable
on
being
poked
down
early
and
his
main
gap
closer,
Slice
and
Dice
is
relatively
short.
Ranged
champions
with
good
kiting
mechanics
such
as
Teemo
.
Kennen
,
Jayce
,
Ryze
,
Nidalee
,
Kayle
,
and
Lulu
can
crowd
control
Renekton
and/or
safely
create
distance
between
Renekton
and
kite
safely.
Keep
in
note
that
Renekton
does
not
use
mana
as
a
resource,
has
a
built
in
heal
with
empowered
Cull
the
Meek
,
and
can
build
common
lifesteal
items
such
as
Ravenous
Hydra
to
stay
in
lane
longer.
Build
accordingly
to
counter
him.
Watch
his
Fury
bar.
Renekton
will
usually
be
passive
until
he
gains
fury,
then
attack
you
with
Slice
and
Dice
,
hit
you
with
a
Fury
empowered
Cull
the
Meek
or
Ruthless
Predator
and
back
off
with
Slice
and
Dice's
secondary
dash.
Position
yourself
in
the
brush
and
make
yourself
hard
to
reach
for
Renekton
,
force
him
to
get
out
of
position.
Never
get
careless
against
Renekton
:
He
has
a
powerful
combination
of
a
stun
,
mobility
and
sustain.
Due
to
Renekton
's
"AD
caster"
playstyle,
he's
extremely
weakened
and
disrupted
by
silences
,
but
not
blinds
.
Keep
this
in
mind
when
playing
against
him.
One
of
Renekton
's
biggest
weaknesses
is
powerful
burst
nukers.
Excluding
Slice
and
Dice's
mobility,
he's
essentially
a
melee
character
that's
easy
to
be
bursted
down
from
a
range
and
kited
with
crowd
control
.
Renekton
has
a
naturally
high
health
pool,
further
complimented
by
Dominus
,
which
leaves
him
vulnerable
to
items
and
abilities
that
deal
percent
health
damage
like
Deathfire
Grasp
unless
he
has
built
resistances.
Usually
Renekton's
Slice
and
Dice
can
be
used
once,
but
if
it
hits
an
enemy,
he
gains
the
ability
to
use
it
twice.
This
will
allow
Renekton
to
cover
over
800
units
of
distance.
If
the
situation
allows
it,
don't
let
him
hit
an
enemy
with
Slice
and
Dice
,
which
can
be
difficult
as
he
can
use
the
ability
on
minions
.
At
level
6,
Renekton
gains
the
access
to
use
Dominus
.
It
can
make
turret
diving
him
a
very
difficult
task
because
he
will
quickly
be
able
to
receive
a
large
bonus
of
health
,
which
is
also
essentially
a
heal
that
cannot
be
reduced
by
Ignite
.
It
will
also
grant
him
access
to
a
lot
of
bonus
Fury
which
can
net
him
a
powerful
heal
from
Cull
the
Meek
or
an
extra
long
stun
from
Ruthless
Predator
.
Dominus
is
an
extremely
powerful
ability,
especially
in
the
early
to
mid
stages
of
the
game.
The
extra
health
makes
a
Renekton
in
this
form
more
durable
than
most
champions.
The
additional
fury
and
AoE
damage
can
enable
Renekton
to
dish
out
deceptive
and
overwhelming
amounts
of
damage,
essentially
being
able
to
kill
two
champions
by
himself
easily.
Approach
a
level
6
Renekton
with
care.
Be
sure
to
build
armor
when
playing
against
Renekton
.
He
deals
high
bursts
of
physical
damage
.
Renekton
might
choose
to
build
more
towards
damage
or
tanking.
Pay
attention
to
this:
If
you
force
him
to
build
tanky
he
will
greatly
fall
off
late
game
because
of
the
nature
of
his
kit.
If
he
builds
towards
damage,
prioritize
him
accordingly
in
teamfights
and
be
sure
to
lock
him
down
with
crowd
control
.
He
has
extremely
high
ability
ratios
but
low
survivability
outside
of
health,
sustain,
and
Dominus
.
While
tanky
DPS
Renekton
greatly
loses
power
late
game,
he's
very
difficult
to
deal
with
early
to
mid
game.
You
should
try
to
isolate
him
out
of
teamfights
and
always
know
his
location.
