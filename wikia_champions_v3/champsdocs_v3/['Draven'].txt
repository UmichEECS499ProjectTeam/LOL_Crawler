Ability
Details
Spinning
Axe
is
an
on-hit
effect.
The
triggering
attack
will
apply
other
on-hit
effects
and
can
critically
strike
as
normal.
As
with
most
on-hit
physical
damage,
the
bonus
damage
from
Spinning
Axe
will
apply
life
steal
.
Critical
strikes
will
not
interact
with
Spinning
Axe's
bonus
damage.
Attacks
against
structures
will
refresh
the
timer
on
active
Spinning
Axes,
but
will
not
deal
bonus
damage
or
cause
the
axe
to
bounce.
The
bonus
damage
will
be
negated
if
the
auto
attack
is
dodged
,
blocked
,
parried
,
or
if
the
attack
misses
.
However,
the
axe
will
still
bounce
off.
Additional
Information:
Spinning
Axe's
landing
location
is
determined
by
Draven's
direction
of
movement
at
the
time
of
Spinning
Axe's
impact
on
the
target.
If
Draven
is
not
moving
at
this
time,
the
Spinning
Axe
will
bounce
back
towards
his
current
location,
either
landing
directly
on
him
or
to
his
sides.
On
the
other
hand
if
Draven
is
moving,
the
Spinning
Axe
will
bounce
ahead
of
him,
either
directly
in
his
path
or
slightly
off
to
the
sides.
Spinning
Axe
will
place
a
visual
cue
on
the
ground
where
it
will
land.
This
visual
cue
is
visible
to
both
player
teams,
although
Draven
himself
will
see
a
more
prominent
marker
(a
golden
sigil).
If
there
is
another
Draven
on
the
enemy
team,
he
will
be
able
to
catch
your
axes
and
you
will
be
able
to
catch
his.
Catching
the
enemy's
Spinning
Axes
will
have
the
same
effect
as
if
you
caught
one
of
your
own.
While
Draven
can
only
carry
two
axes
at
once,
it
is
possible
to
have
a
three
axes
running
at
the
same
time
by
keeping
at
least
one
Spinning
Axe
in
the
air
at
all
times,
a.k.a.
juggling.

Information:
Airborne
crowd
control
effects,
such
as
knock-aside,
will
interrupt
dash
abilities
without
allowing
them
to
complete
their
path.
This
is
unlike
other
forms
of
crowd
control,
which
will
merely
affect
the
target
when
they
arrive.

hurls
two
massive
axes
in
a
given
direction,
dealing
physical
damage
to
every
enemy
struck.
Upon
reaching
the
edge
of
the
map,
striking
an
enemy
champion
or
upon
the
reactivation
of
Whirling
Death,
the
axes
will
slowly
come
to
a
stop
before
changing
direction
and
returning
to
Draven,
dealing
the
same
damage
to
every
enemy
struck
on
the
way
back.
Whirling
Death
deals
8%
less
damage
for
each
unit
hit,
down
to
a
minimum
of
40%.
The
damage
reduction
resets
when
the
axes
reverse
direction.

Ability
Details
Whirling
Death
is
a
global
linear,
pass-through
skill
shot
that
returns
to
Draven
upon
reaching
the
edge
of
the
map
or
colliding
with
an
enemy
champion.
Applies
spell
effects
as
an
area
of
effect
ability.
Spell
vamp
is
reduced
to
one-third
effectiveness.
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
will
apply
a
15%
slow.
Spell
shields
will
block
one
instance
of
the
damage.
Additional
Information:
Whirling
Death
grants
sight
along
its
path.
"Changing
direction"
does
not
occur
instantly.
Rather,
the
axes
will
decelerate
and
come
to
complete
stop
before
turning
around.
With
careful
timing,
it
is
possible
to
reactivate
the
ability
and
cause
an
enemy
to
take
two
instances
of
damage
instantly.
Upon
changing
direction,
Whirling
Death's
damage
will
reset
to
the
full
amount.
This
is
unlike
a
similar
ability,
Boomerang
Blade
,
which
continues
to
diminish
throughout.
If
Draven
dies
before
the
axe
changes
direction,
it
will
fizzle
upon
reaching
the
edge
of
the
map
or
striking
an
enemy
champion.
If
the
axe
is
already
in
the
process
of
decelerating,
it
will
still
fizzle
upon
coming
to
a
complete
stop.
