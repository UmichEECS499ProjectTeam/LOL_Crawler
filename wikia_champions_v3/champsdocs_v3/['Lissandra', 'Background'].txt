Lore
Lissandra's
magic
twists
the
pure
power
of
ice
into
something
dark
and
terrible.
With
the
force
of
her
black
ice,
she
does
more
than
freeze
–
she
impales
and
crushes
those
who
oppose
her.
To
the
terrified
denizens
of
the
north,
she
is
known
only
as
"The
Ice
Witch".
The
truth
is
much
more
sinister:
Lissandra
is
a
corrupter
of
nature
who
plots
to
unleash
an
ice
age
on
the
world.
Centuries
ago,
Lissandra
betrayed
her
tribe
to
evil
creatures,
known
as
the
Frozen
Watchers,
in
return
for
power.
That
was
the
last
day
that
warm
blood
ran
through
her
veins.
With
her
corrupted
tribesmen
and
the
strength
of
the
Watchers,
she
swept
across
the
land
like
a
terrible
blizzard.
As
her
empire
spread,
the
world
grew
colder
and
ice
choked
the
land.
When
the
Watchers
were
defeated
by
ancient
heroes,
Lissandra
did
not
lose
faith
and
swore
to
prepare
the
world
for
their
return.
Lissandra
worked
to
purge
all
knowledge
of
the
Watchers
from
the
world.
Using
magic
to
take
human
form,
she
masqueraded
as
numerous
seers
and
elders.
Over
the
course
of
generations,
she
rewrote
the
stories
of
the
Freljord
,
and
so
the
history
of
its
people
changed.
Today
the
fragmented
retellings
of
the
Watchers
are
seen
as
children's
tales.
But
this
deception
wasn't
enough
–
Lissandra
also
needed
an
army.
She
set
her
sights
on
the
noble
Frostguard
tribe.
Lissandra
knew
corrupting
the
Frostguard
would
take
centuries,
and
so
she
launched
her
greatest
deception.
She
murdered
and
stole
the
identity
of
the
Frostguard
leader.
Then
she
slowly
began
to
warp
the
tribe's
proud
traditions.
When
her
human
form
grew
old,
she
faked
her
own
death
and
then
murdered
her
successor
to
steal
her
identity.
With
each
generation,
the
Frostguard
grew
more
insular,
cruel
and
twisted.
Today,
the
world
still
sees
them
as
a
noble
and
peaceful
tribe
that
guards
against
evil
creatures
like
the
Ice
Witch.
In
truth,
they
now
serve
the
witch
and
long
for
the
glorious
return
of
the
Watchers.
Lissandra
knows
that
on
that
day
nations
will
fall
and
the
world
will
be
reborn
in
ice.

your
eyes

cold
take
you."

Lissandra
"We
are
the
chosen,
destined
to
receive
the
gifts
of
the
Watchers.
Our
faith
is
tested
by
bitter
cold
and
endless
winter.
A
crucible
that
separates
the
worthy
from
the
unworthy,
purging
doubt,
and
leaving
purity
behind.
The
others
fight
like
neglected
children,
petty
squabbles
that
will
amount
to
nothing
in
the
end.
We
have
purpose,
to
prepare
this
land
for
new
masters.
The
Watchers
return.
Our
ascendance
is
at
hand."

The

Claw,
the
most
warlike
and
brutal
of
the
tribes.
Led
by
Sejuani
,
they
think
peace
is
another
word
for
weakness.
Sejuani
has
sworn
to
purge
this
weakness.
Through
war,
the
Freljord
will
be
purified.
Far
in
the
north,
the
peaceful
Frostguard
protect
Freljord's
ancient
secrets
-
or
so
the
world
believes.
In
truth,
the
Frostguard
protect
me,
Lissandra.
While
others
bicker,
we
prepare.
When
the
time
is
right,
we
will
strike.
They
cannot
withstand
us,
they
are
only
human.
And
when
the
war
is
over,
the
world,
our
world,
will
be
reborn

Lesser
clans
have
scrambled
for
the
right

this
frozen
land
for
millennia
-
all
have
failed.
Now,
finally
three
great
leaders
have
emerged
to
rally
the
lesser
tribes
beneath
their
banners.
The
storms
of
war
will
cloud
the
sky
when
their
paths
cross,
but
once
this
battle
is
over,
the
people
will
find
just
one
tribe
left,
to
rule
the
land."

Now,

is
our
time.
"I
have
seen
the
future,
and
it
is
cold.
The
Watchers
return
and
they
are
so
pleased
with
you.
They

take
away

They

take

Barbarian
Conclave
Arrives
in
Freljord
Tryndamere
honors
the
former
Ice
Dervish's
passing
Quinton
Groat
reporting
from
Rakelstake,
Freljord
The
modest
population
of
Freljord
was
in
shock
this
week,
as
hundreds
of
barbarians
-
including
Tryndamere,
the
Barbarian
King
-
arrived
to
pay
respects
to
the
late
Princess
Mauvole
of
the
Ice
Dervish
tribe.
Princess
Lissandra,
her
successor,
appeared
unsurprised
by
the
event,
fueling
rumors
that
this
may
have
been
part
of
the
discussions
in
her
recent
summit
with
Princess
Ashe,
the
Frost
Archer
and
Tryndamere's
fellow
League
champion.
Ashe
was
present
for
the
barbarian
procession,
and
she
met
afterward
with
Tryndamere
and
Lissandra
for
a
private
dinner.
The
visiting
barbarians
have
conducted
themselves
with
uncharacteristic
civility
within
Rakelstake,
offering
assistance
to
local
businesses
and
sharing
the
spoils
of
their
daily
hunts.
Less
than
one
month
ago,
Lissandra
swore
fealty
to
Ashe,
inciting
malice
from
the
third
tribe
leader
Princess
Sejuani,
the
Winter's
Claw
.
Sejuani
retreated
to
isolation
shortly
after
the
announcement,
causing
speculation
that
she
would
respond
to
the
alliance
with
violence,
but
there
have
been
no
reports
of
activity
from
the
Winter's
Claw
tribe
in
the
last
month.
The
arrival
of
the
barbarians,
some
predict,
is
a
reactionary
show
of
force
by
the
newly
united
tribes.
Sejuani
could
not
be
reached
for
questioning,
and
no
comment
was
offered
by
any
tribesman
of
the
Winter's
Claw.
Tryndamere's
appearance
in
Freljord
comes
at
a
strange
time,
as
the
barbarians
have
recently
militarized
in
response
to
escalating
Noxian
aggressions,
a
product
of
their
Northern
Barbarian-Pacification
campaign.
Tryndamere
has
historically
spearheaded
the
resistance
against
Noxian
incursion,
and
his
absence
at
such
a
critical
time
has
raised
some
eyebrows.
When
questioned,
Tryndamere
laughed,
"Worry
about
barbarians?
Save
your
worry
for
Noxus."
His
confidence
seems
not
to
be
misplaced,
as
an
anonymous
Noxian
source
informs
us
that
Pacification
efforts
have
been
stymied
by
unyielding
barbarian
patrols.
The
arrival
of
League
Emissary
Gravil
Torenk
in
Rakelstake
yesterday
further
added
to
the
commotion.
According
to
local
authorities,
he
was
summoned
to
the
Dervish
Crystal
Hall
for
an
audience
with
Lissandra
and
her
League
guests.

No
announcements
have
been
made
following
the
meeting,
but
the
air
is
charged
with
anticipation
as
citizens
of
Rakelstake
await
some
explanation
as
to
why
the
small
city
has
received
this
bizarre
influx
of
visitors.
For
our
part,
we
were
provided
only
with
this
statement
from
the
Barbarian
King,
as
he
left
the
Crystal
Hall
en
route
to
a
nearby
barbarian
camp,
"I
don't
know
why
people
are
so
curious.
Freljord
is
a
lovely
place;
the
air
has
the
kind
of
sting
we
barbarians
can
appreciate.
Besides,
would
you
decline
an
invitation
from
the
Frost
Archer?"

Lissandra,
the
Ice
Witch,
Revealed
Posted
by
RiotWenceslaus
[1]
:
Lissandra
is
a
flexible,
mana-efficient
mage
with
abilities
that
emphasize
crowd
control,
kiting
and
mobility
over
raw
damage.
Abilities
:
Iceborn
(Passive):
After
a
brief
cooldown,
Lissandra's
next
ability
costs
no
mana.
Hitting
an
enemy
with
movement
impairing
abilities
reduces
Iceborn's
cooldown.
Ice
Shard
:
Lissandra
throws
a
spear
of
ice
that
shatters
on
contact
with
the
first
enemy
struck,
dealing
damage
and
slowing
their
movement
speed
for
a
short
duration.
Enemies
behind
the
struck
target
also
take
damage.
Ring
of
Frost
:
Lissandra
freezes
the
area
around
her,
dealing
damage
to
nearby
enemies
and
rooting
them
for
a
short
duration.
Glacial
Path
:
Lissandra
casts
a
slow-moving,
long-range
ice
claw
in
a
line,
dealing
damage
to
all
enemies
in
its
path.
Re-activating
Glacial
Path
teleports
Lissandra
to
the
claw's
current
location.
Frozen
Tomb
(Ultimate):
On
enemy
cast:
Lissandra
freezes
an
enemy
champion,
damaging
and
stunning
them
briefly.
Dark
Ice
emanates
from
the
target,
dealing
damage
and
slowing
nearby
enemies.
On
self-cast:
Lissandra
encases
herself
in
ice,
rooting
herself
in
place
briefly
and
becoming
untargetable
and
invulnerable.
Dark
Ice
emanates
from
Lissandra,
dealing
damage
and
slowing
nearby
enemies.
Gameplay
:
Mid
lane:
Lissandra's
mobility
and
crowd
control
skills
make
her
an
ideal
choice
for
aggressive,
roaming
mid
play.
By
shoving
the
lane
with
her
AoE
abilities,
the
Ice
Witch
can
create
the
space
she
needs
to
make
a
move
on
top
or
bottom
lane.
The
long
range
blink
from
Glacial
Path
lets
her
get
the
drop
on
enemies
from
unexpected
angles
by
jumping
terrain
or
by
circumventing
typical
ward
locations.
Once
the
ambush
has
been
sprung,
Lissandra's
potent
combination
of
slows,
roots
and
stuns
allows
her
to
stick
to
an
opponent
and
close
out
the
kill.
Top
lane:
Lissandra's
passive
allows
her
to
be
much
less
dependent
on
blue
buff
compared
to
many
of
her
AP
counterparts,
making
her
an
excellent,
self-sufficient
choice
for
top
lane.
Despite
her
low
base
durability,
the
long
range
blink
on
Glacial
Path
helps
Lissandra
stay
safe
by
pulling
off
daring
escapes.
If
she's
caught
in
a
gank,
Lissandra
can
freeze
her
would-be
killers
in
place
with
Ring
of
Frost
before
disappearing
over
terrain
with
a
well-placed
Glacial
Path.
The
area
of
effect
damage
on
Ice
Shard
also
allows
Lissandra
to
guard
turrets
even
when
pressured,
or
press
the
lane
in
an
attempt
to
lure
enemy
junglers
into
a
counter-gank.
When
an
opponent
takes
the
bait,
Lissandra
can
cast
Frozen
Tomb
on
herself,
ensuring
her
own
survival
as
she
uses
her
other
abilities
to
set
up
kills.
Team
fights:
Lissandra
isn't
the
type
of
mage
who
immediately
blows
up
high-value
targets,
but
instead
has
the
potential
to
lay
down
impressive
amounts
of
damage
and
crowd
control
on
grouped
up
opponents.
The
AoE
aspect
to
Ice
Shard
keeps
enemies
pinned
down
through
repeated
area
damage
and
slow
effects
while
she
waits
for
the
opportune
moment
to
unleash
her
full
combo.
Once
she
sees
an
opening,
Lissandra
can
use
Glacial
Path
to
close
in
and
lock
down
a
high-value
target
with
Frozen
Tomb.
If
the
opposing
team
starts
to
focus
her,
Lissandra
can
instead
use
Frozen
Tomb
on
herself,
juking
the
initial
burst
before
escaping
with
Ring
of
Frost.
If
you're
looking
for
a
mage
who
favors
crowd
control,
mobility
and
kiting
over
raw
burst
damage,
Lissandra
is
sure
to
make
a
welcome
addition
to
your
lineup.

casts
a
slow-moving,
long-range
ice

Glacial
Path
teleports

to
the
claw's
current
location.

dealing
damage
and
slowing
