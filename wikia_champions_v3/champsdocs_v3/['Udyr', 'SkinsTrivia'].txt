Udyr's
Theme
Trivia
Udyr
was
designed
by
Coronach
.
He
was
the
first
Champion
released
after
the
official
October
27,
2009
launch
of
the
game.
A
producer
at
Riot
Games
is
named
after
him.
[1]
Udyr
is
voiced
by
J.S.
Gilbert.
Udyr's
orignal
champion
title
was
"the
Animal
Spirit"
but
with
the
Freljord
patch
his
champion
title
was
changed
to
"the
Spirit
Walker"
and
changes
were
also
made
to
his
lore.
He
is
the
only
character
that
cannot
max
out
all
of
his
skills,
as
each
of
his
skills
have
five
levels
and
the
max
character
level
is
18
(18
points
for
a
total
of
20
possible
ranks).
He
is
the
only
character
without
an
ultimate.
Udyr
has
4
skills
that
can
be
leveled
up
to
the
maximum
rank
of
5.
Udyr
is
one
of
a
few
champions
to
have
multiple
textures
in
one
skin.
Udyr
however
has
more
different
textures
in
one
skin
than
any
other
champion,
as
he
has
a
different
one
for
each
of
his
stances.
Udyr's
dance
shows
the
Drunken
Master
Kung
Fu
Style.
A
side-by-side
comparison
can
be
seen
here.
The
word
"Udyr"
literally
translates
into
"Beast"
in
Norwegian.
The
Danish
words
"Uhyr"
and
"Dyr"
mean
"Monster"
and
"Animal",
while
"udyr"
is
mostly
used
to
describe
people
as
evil,
acting
like
animals
and
not
caring
if
they
kill.
Udyr
is
one
of
two
champions
that
went
into
the
weekly
champion
rotation
on
the
day
of
their
release.
The
other
one
is
Poppy
.
Udyr
was
one
of
the
champions
chosen
for
the
Ionian
pool
available
during
the
Ionia
vs.
Noxus
match
.
He
was
one
of
the
selected
champions,
and
was
voted
the
MVP.
Almost
all
of
Udyr's
skills
are
based
off
the
4
Beasts
of
the
Cardinal
Directions
,
with
the
sole
exception
of
the
Azure
Dragon.
Quotes
Udyr's
joke
"If
PETA
asks,
this
fur
is
fake"
refers
to
the
Animal
Rights
group
People
for
Ethical
Treatment
of
Animals
and
their
notorious
ways
of
getting
the
public
to
not
wear
fur.
Skins
Spirit
Guard
Udyr's
appearance
and
clothing
style
resembles
that
of
Shaolin
monks
and
guardian
statues
found
in
temples
and
shrines
of
Asian
culture.
They
are
often
depicted
in
a
meditative
or
defensive
posture,
featuring
exposed
torsos
and
wearing
large
prayer
beads
over
some
body
parts.
Traditional
footwear
(like
Japanese
Geta
)
and
waistcloth
(similar
to
South-Asian
garments
like
a
Lungi)
as
well
as
bright
glowing
eyes
without
pupils
are
also
recurring
features
seen
among
them.
He
also
bears
a
striking
resemblance
to
the
Sura
Master
NPC
from
Ragnarok
Online,
if
one
doesn't
count
for
the
hairstyle.
Spirit
Guard
Udyr's
Level
5
Bear
Stance
has
a
similarity
to
Oni
,
one
of
Akumas
alternate
forms.
Both
have
bluish
glowing
skin
and
aura,
bear-claw
shaped
hands,
exposed
upper
bodies
and
gruffy
hairstyle
resembling
flames.
Using
a
Dance,
Laugh,
or
Taunt
emote
command
with
Spirit
Guard
Udyr
summons
whichever
spirit
corresponds
to
his
current
stance.
His
Dance
will
summon
all
four
spirits
in
sequence
once
any
given
ability
has
reached
rank
five.
His
Joke
summons
Urf
,
which
finally
explains
where
Urf's
spirit
went
after
being
killed
by
Warwick.
The
skin
theme
represents
his
state
as
a
monk
after
finding
his
inner
harmony
and
conquering
his
rage
completely
with
the
help
of
Ionian
monks,
even
when
fusing
with
one
of
the
four
spirits.
This
stands
in
strong
contrast
to
his
non-ultimate
skins
which
represent
his
feral
nature
and
somewhat
still-uncontrolled
rage.
