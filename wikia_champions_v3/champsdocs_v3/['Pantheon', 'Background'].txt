Lore
Far
above
the
clouds
on
Mount
Targon
resides
a
stalwart
tribe
of
people
known
as
the
Rakkor
who
still
revere
combat
and
war
as
ultimate
artforms.
They
remember
the
Runewars
of
Runeterra
and
know
that
the
League
of
Legends
can
only
repress
the
rising
tides
of
violence
for
so
long.
Each
member
of
the
tribe
is
bred
to
be
a
disciplined
and
vicious
warrior,
preferring
to
battle
soldiers
of
either
the
Noxian
or
Demacian
armies
only
when
outnumbered
at
least
ten
to
one.
Rakkor
warriors
are
trained
not
only
to
be
as
lethal
with
their
bare
hands
as
the
most
capable
martial
artists,
but
also
to
fiercely
wield
the
many
relic-weapons
of
the
tribe.
Such
treasures
have
been
handed
down
from
generation
to
generation,
and
have
harnessed
the
mystical
nature
of
Runeterra
in
their
very
cores.
These
relic-weapons
are
among
the
most
dangerous
in
existence
-
and
it
comes
as
no
surprise
that
they
have
found
their
way
to
the
League
of
Legends
in
the
hands
of
Pantheon.
This
stone-faced
warrior
is
a
paragon
of
his
people,
his
very
existence
is
an
anthem
of
exultation
to
the
art
of
combat.
Pantheon
found
it
insulting
that
the
people
of
Valoran
would
install
an
organization
to
replace
war,
complete
with
so-called
champions
,
without
including
the
Rakkor.
Gathering
the
blessings
of
his
tribe
and
armed
with
the
relics
of
his
ancestors,
he
has
descended
on
the
League
to
show
the
world
a
true
warrior.
He
cares
not
who
he
fights,
and
cares
nothing
for
the
pageantry
or
prestige
of
a
League
champion,
but
lives
only
for
the
austere
glory
of
battle.
As
long
as
Pantheon
breathes,
he
thirsts
for
another
foe
to
vanquish.
"I
was
hoping
they
had
more
reinforcements."

Pantheon
,
standing
amidst
the
pieces
of
a
brutalized
Noxian
battalion.

Champion
Sneak
Peek
Announcement
made
in
the
sneak
peek
by
Pendragon:
[1]
Since
Singed
joined
the
League
of
Legends
,
there
has
been
a
decided
dearth
of
champions
with
extremely
large
shields.
Luckily,
Pantheon
is
coming
to
help
prevent
this
extremely
important
demographic
from
becoming
marginalized.

Protection
(Innate)
