Trivia
Thresh
was
designed
by
CertainlyT
.
[1]
To
"thresh"
means
to
separate
grain
from
wheat,
usually
with
a
sickle,
or
by
a
revolving
mechanism.
Thresh's
weapon
is
very
similar
to
a
sickle,
and
his
victims
and
their
souls
could
be
seen
as
the
wheat
and
grain.
The
way
Thresh
swings
his
chain
could
allude
to
the
way
grain
is
separated
from
wheat
using
a
revolving
mechanism.
Thresh
is
the
first
champion
to
be
released
in
2013.
Incidentally,
his
base
health
at
level
18
is
2013.
Thresh
is
possibly
inspired
by
the
Four
Horsemen
of
the
Apocalypse
,
particularly
the
rider
symbolizing
Death.
(The
other
horsemen
theme
champions
to
have
been
released
so
far
are
Karthus
Mordekaiser
and
Hecarim
.)
Thresh
was
the
first
champion
to
be
released
with
the
new
champion
price
structure,
costing
7800
for
the
first
week.
[2]
When
Thresh
dies
his
own
soul
is
harvested
by
his
lantern.
You
can
faintly
hear
his
fearful
laments
as
his
soul
is
removed.
Thresh's
story
is
similar
to
that
of
the
main
antagonist,
a
mad
doctor,
from
the
movie
Asylum
.
Both
loved
torturing
their
prisoners/patients
until
the
victims'
riot
which
resulted
in
their
revenge
against
the
warden/doctor,
but
both
returned
to
continue
their
murderous
and
sadistic
acts.
Thresh
tricked
Lucian's
wife,
Senna,
and
trapped
her
soul
in
his
lantern,
for
which
he
seeks
revenge.
The
weapon
that
Thresh
uses
is
similar
to
the
kusarigama
-
a
weapon
that
consists
of
a
sickle
attached
to
a
metal
chain
with
a
heavy
weight
at
the
end.
The
weapon
was
traditionally
used
by
ninjas
in
Feudal
Japan
.
Thresh
and
Urgot
were
previously
the
only
ranged
champions
classified
as
tanks.
However,
as
of
the
Summer
2013
role-rework,
Thresh
is
now
classified
as
a
Support/Fighter.
Thresh
is
the
second
ranged
champion
to
not
use
projectiles
for
ranged
basic
attacks,
the
first
being
Kayle
.
Thresh
has,
in
fact,
three
different
attack
animations.
In
melee
range,
he
hits
directly
with
the
sickle,
at
mid-range
he
swings
his
sickle
in
a
circular
and
horizontal
movement,
and
at
long-range
he
uses
it
like
a
whip.
Mid
range
is
around
250-300
unit
of
distance.
When
reaching
a
certain
amount
of
movement
speed,
Thresh's
movement
animation
shows
him
gliding
instead
of
running.
When
Thresh
dances,
he
swings
his
scythe
and
his
lantern
like
a
pair
poi
(or
kiwido
or
bolas),
a
side
by
side
comparison
can
be
seen
here
.
The
tricks
Thresh
does
is
a
basic
forward
weave,
a
stationary
forward
windmill
and
an
alternating
behind-the-back
butterfly.
With
all
his
hooks,
chains,
many
of
the
elements
in
his
background,
and
the
ability
names
"Keeper
of
Lost
Souls"
(former),
"Flay",
and
"The
Box"
it
is
possible
that
Thresh's
motif
is
a
reference
to
Clive
Barker's
Hellraiser
franchise.
Thresh's
Death
Sentence
ability
has
a
unique
quirk;
unlike
most
spells
with
a
windup
casting
time,
Thresh
does
not
face
the
specific
direction
he
is
casting
the
ability
until
he
actually
sends
out
the
hook.
CertainlyT
deliberately
designed
the
ability
to
fit
in
with
Thresh's
theme
of
causing
terror
in
his
enemies.
[3]
Thresh
is
the
first
champion
with
an
ability
that
can
affect
an
allied
champions
position,
namely
Dark
Passage
.
Thresh
currently
has
the
strongest
slowing
crowd
control
effect
in
the
game,
with
The
Box
slowing
by
99%.
It
may
be
noted
though,
that
there
is
a
hard
cap
for
movement
speed
at
110.
Therefore,
any
slow
above
75%
is
not
used
to
its
full
potential.
For
more
information
check
movement
speed
.
Thresh's
login
music
is
a
reference
to
the
nursery
rhyme(s)
"Rain
Rain
Go
Away"
and/or
"Ring
Around
the
Rosey"
.
Thresh
is
the
third
champion
who
features
lyrics
in
his
opening
theme.
The
first
two
are
Diana
and
Vi
.
Nunu
and
Willump
will
drop
one
soul
each
,
for
a
total
of
two
souls!
[4]
It
is
a
Hidden
Passive.
While
similar,
Sejuani
and
Bristle
only
drop
one
soul
between
them.
This
had
led
to
a
joke
among
the
community
that
Sejuani
has
ginger
hair
in
reference
to
the
internet
meme
that
gingers
have
no
soul.
[5]
However,
Katarina
,
Leona
and
Miss
Fortune
are
redheaded
and
do
drop
a
soul
upon
death.
Sejuani
and
Bristle's
case
may
also
stem
from
the
religious
belief
that
animals
have
no
souls.
[6]
Although
Zombie
Brand
and
Haunted
Maokai
also
have
revival
animations
prior
to
Thresh's
release,
Thresh
is
the
first
champion
to
have
the
revival
animation
in
his
classic
skin.
Thresh
is
one
of
four
champions
that
can
theoretically
infinitely
increase
their
stats
by
using
their
abilities,
in
Thresh's
case
its
his
ability
power
and
armor
.
The
other
three
are
Nasus
(Q
damage),
Sion
(health)
and
Veigar
(ability
power).
However,
the
number
of
souls
caps
at
999,999,
at
which
point
Thresh
will
have
749,999
bonus
armor
and
ability
power.
The
Box
in
Lucian
'
s
Death
recap
states
"You
have
broken
the
wall.
Your
price
is
death".
Quotes
Thresh's
quote
"Come
out
and
play!"
is
shared
with
Draven
.
Thresh's
quote,
"I
am
the
thing
under
the
bed,"
might
be
a
response
to
Cho'Gath's
"No,
I
do
not
live
under
a
bed...
fool!"
.
It
is
also
a
reference
to
the
bogeyman
-
the
original
"Monster
under
the
bed".
Thresh
shares
a
quote
with
Evelynn
,
Ezreal
,
Irelia
,
and
Annie
-
"This
way."
Thresh
and
Caitlyn
share
a
quote
when
they
use
their
Ultimates
-
"Nowhere
to
hide"
Skins
The
Championship
Thresh
skin
has
many
references
to
the
number
three,
likely
due
to
being
released
as
a
promotional
skin
for
the
Season
Three
World
Championship.
Examples
of
this
are
Thresh's
robe
splitting
into
three
tails,
the
top
of
his
lantern
being
split
into
three
parts
and
the
presence
of
a
crest
with
three
lines
on
his
back
resembling
the
Roman
numeral
for
three.
It
could
be
noted
that
Thresh
has
3
'dreadlocks',
possibly
hinting
to
another
reference
to
the
number
three.
The
Deep
Terror
Thresh
skin
may
be
a
reference
to
Davy
Jones
from
the
Pirates
of
the
Caribbean
franchise,
and
in
turn
a
reference
to
the
legend
of
Davy
Jones'
Locker
.
The
skin
shows
some
resemblance
to
the
design
of
the
character
Davy
Jones
and
his
crew,
with
a
similar
dark
aquatic
motif.
To
'send
someone
to
Davy
Jones'
Locker'
is
a
euphemism
for
sending
them
to
the
bottom
of
the
ocean,
effectively
damning
them;
Deep
Terror
Thresh
may
be
a
twist
on
the
legend
of
Davy
Jones,
with
his
lantern
being
the
literal
'locker'.
When
Thresh
recalls
while
using
this
skin,
he
brings
out
a
chest
and
stands
on
it
with
a
pose
similar
to
Captain
Morgan
.
Thresh
has
a
random
second
recall
animation
where,
instead
of
pulling
out
a
chest,
he
pulls
out
a
tire
and
slumps
in
disappointment.
It
can
be
seen
here.
Music
Thresh's
Theme
Cling
clang
go
the
chains,
Someone's
out
to
find
you.
Cling
clang
oh
the
chains,
The
Warden's
right
behind
you.
Quick
now,
the
seeking
chains,
Approach
with
their
shrill
scrape.
Don't
stop,
flee
the
chains,
Your
last
chance
to
escape.
Drag
the
chains,
drag
the
chains,
With
all
the
strength
you
may!
Drag
the
chains,
drag
the
chains,
'ere
they
drag
you
away!
Cling
clang
go
the
chains,
There's
no
more
time
for
fear!
Cling
clang
know
the
chains,
The
last
sound
that
you'll
hear...
