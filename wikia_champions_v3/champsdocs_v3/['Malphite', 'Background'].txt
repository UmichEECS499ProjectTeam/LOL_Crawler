There
is
a
world
of
perfect
harmony,
where
all
are
part
of
the
whole.
The
Monolith
is
the
essence
of
all
creation,
and
its
denizens
are
but
singular
pieces
of
it.
It
is
beautiful
in
its
symmetry,
and
in
its
almost
complete
lack
of
uncertainty.
The
rocky
beings
that
live
there
know
their
place
and
work
to
fulfill
their
duties
to
the
fullest
extent,
functioning
almost
as
a
superorganism
or
hive.
Malphite
has
always
strived
to
live
up
to
his
full
potential,
as
his
own
personal
part
of
the
whole,
serving
the
role
of
a
distinguished
creature
questing
to
enforce
his
people's
flawless
vision
of
order.
One
day,
without
warning,
a
dimensional
rift
opened,
and
he
was
summoned
across
the
cosmos
to
the
world
of
Runeterra
.
The
transition
was
painful
and
terrifying
for
him,
as
he
was
cut
off
from
the
song
of
his
people
and
the
Monolith
-
things
that
had
been
ever-present
in
him
since
the
day
he
was
born.
He
raged,
trapped
in
the
Summoning
Circle,
as
those
who
had
called
him
made
their
plea.
Runeterra
was
a
world
that
had
nearly
been
consumed
by
its
disharmony.
It
was
a
world
that
needed
champions
to
bring
order
out
of
chaos.
It
was
to
that
end
that
the
rock-creature
was
summoned,
so
that
he
could
aid
them
in
this
quest.
Looking
past
his
own
fear
and
apprehension,
Malphite
could
see
that
this
was
a
respectable
goal,
and
one
in
which
he
could
participate
-
perhaps
uniquely
so.
Today,
as
part
of
the
League
of
Legends
,
he
hammers
those
who
would
seek
to
upset
Valoran
's
movement
toward
order,
especially
turning
his
attention
to
those
that
wield
chaotic
magic.
Unfortunately,
Malphite
has
also
begun
to
change,
as
he
has
been
forced
to
face
his
own
profound
loneliness
among
the
world's
vibrant
individuality.
"Beware,
minions
of
chaos!
The
Shard
of
the
Monolith
has
come."
There
is
a
world
of
perfect
harmony,
where
all
are
part
of
the
whole.
The
Monolith
is
the
essence
of
all
and
its
denizens
are
but
singular
pieces
of
the
whole.
Malphite
has
always
strived
to
live
up
to
his
full
potential
as
his
own
personal
part
of
the
whole,
a
distinguished
creature
questing
to
enforce
the
flawless
vision
of
order.
Then
one
day
the
dimensional
rift
opened
and
he
was
summoned
across
the
cosmos
to
the
world
of
Runeterra
.
At
first
outraged
to
be
taken
from
the
Monolith,
Malphite
quickly
learned
of
this
world's
disharmony.
There
were
those
who
sought
to
bring
order
out
of
chaos
and
it
is
they
that
summoned
the
rock-creature
to
aid
them
in
this
quest.
It
was
a
goal
that
Malphite
could
respect
and
one
in
which
he
could
participate.
Today
he
hammers
those
who
would
seek
to
upset
Valoran
's
movement
towards
order,
especially
those
that
wield
chaotic
magic.
"
Beware,
minions
of
chaos!
The

of
the

has
come.
