Lore
Ravaged
by
Rune
Wars
long
past,
the
lands
south
of
the
Great
Barrier
are
wrecked
by
chaotic
magical
storms,
leaving
the
grasp
of
nature's
rule
tenuous
at
best.
While
abnormal
flora
or
fauna
are
the
norm
rather
than
the
exception
in
these
ruined
areas,
perhaps
none
is
more
curious
than
the
case
of
Rammus.
While
no
one
is
entirely
certain
why
an
armadillo
from
the
Shurima
Desert
crossed
the
Kumungu
Jungle
into
the
Plague
Jungles
,
Rammus
made
just
such
a
journey.
There,
amongst
the
twisted
vines
and
festering
rot,
he
came
across
an
oddity
-
a
healthy
evergreen
hedge
maze,
stretching
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see.
As
he
explored
the
maze,
something
compelled
him
towards
its
center
-
a
light,
a
presence
of
some
kind.
As
he
drew
closer,
the
light
surged,
blinding
him
and
knocking
him
unconscious.
When
he
awoke,
Rammus'
whole
world
had
changed.
The
maze
had
vanished
and
he
felt
truly
cognizant
for
the
first
time
in
his
otherwise
unremarkable
life.
As
his
predicament
dawned
on
him,
Rammus
had
a
moment
of
panic.
As
he
trembled,
the
earth
around
him
began
to
shake,
the
intensity
increasing
until
he
managed
to
steady
himself.
As
the
quake
receded,
Rammus
arose
and
left
the
Plague
Jungles
in
search
of
others
like
him.
His
search
brought
him
across
all
the
lands
south
of
the
Great
Barrier,
but
everywhere
he
went,
he
was
unique.
The
hardships
of
this
sojourn
inspired
him
to
craft
the
suit
of
armor
that
would
earn
him
the
title
of
Armordillo.
Rammus's
quest
eventually
drew
him
to
the
only
place
where
a
sentient
armadillo
is
less
than
confounding
-
the
League
of
Legends
.
"I've
seen
a
lot
of
things,
but
this...
this
is
a
first."
―
Ezreal,
the
Prodigal
Explorer
,
after
first
meeting
Rammus

"¿Qué

en

Because
his

are
often
in

of
running
away,
Rammus
has
developed
the

the
duration.
