Master
Yi
Champion
Background

Skins
&
Trivia
Lore
Through
the
ancient
martial
art
of
Wuju,
Master
Yi
tempered
his
body
and
sharpened
his
mind
until
thought
and
action
became
one.
Though
he
chooses
to
enter
into
violence
as
a
last
resort,
the
grace
and
speed
with
which
he
wields
his
blade
ensures
resolution
is
always
swift.
As
the
last
living
practitioner
of
Wuju,
Master
Yi
has
devoted
his
life
to
finding
able
pupils
to
carry
on
the
legacy
of
his
lost
people.
Even
before
Yi
mastered
Wuju,
he
was
considered
one
of
the
most
skilled
practitioners
of
the
mystical
martial
art.
He
would
soon
prove
his
mastery
when
word
of
a
massive
Noxian
invasion
reached
his
remote
village.
Yi
swept
across
the
battlefields
of
Ionia
,
turning
back
the
tide
of
Noxus's
vast
infantry
with
swift
and
deadly
strikes,
much
to
the
embarrassment
of
the
Noxian
High
Command.
Recognizing
the
threat
the
Wuju
disciples
posed
to
their
invasion,
the
Noxians
chose
to
unleash
a
nightmarish
chemical
attack
on
the
home
of
the
deadly
art.
Those
who
somehow
survived
the
poisonous
concoction
had
their
minds
twisted
beyond
repair.
Yi's
home
was
left
in
ruin.
At
the
war's
conclusion,
Yi
returned
to
the
grotesque
remains
of
his
village.
There
he
became
the
attack's
final
casualty.
Slain
in
spirit,
if
not
in
body,
Yi
clung
to
the
only
feeling
left
within
his
heart:
vengeance.
Driven
only
by
his
desire
to
punish
those
who'd
destroyed
his
home,
Yi
spent
years
training
in
seclusion.
He
became
a
deadlier
swordsman
than
he
had
ever
been,
but
true
mastery
of
Wuju
still
eluded
him.
At
the
height
of
Yi's
frustration,
a
monkey
of
unusually
noble
bearing
interrupted
his
training.
Standing
as
straight
and
tall
as
a
man,
the
monkey
watched
and
mimicked
Yi's
movements.
Yi
shooed
the
monkey
away,
but
the
agile
creature
took
great
amusement
in
turning
Yi's
own
techniques
against
him.
Gradually,
Yi
felt
his
anger
subside
as
he
sparred
with
the
playful
animal,
and
when
the
burden
of
his
hatred
had
fully
lifted,
he
found
he
had
caught
the
monkey
by
his
tail.
Yi
then
understood
that
he
would
never
master
Wuju
so
long
as
he
pursued
it
for
vengeance,
and
as
he
let
go
of
the
monkey,
he
also
released
his
desire
to
shed
his
enemy's
blood.
Yi
thanked
the
monkey
for
showing
him
what
he'd
been
blind
to,
and
was
surprised
when
the
creature
actually
replied.
He
wished
to
learn
Yi's
art
of
fighting.
It
was
an
odd
request,
but
through
it
Yi
saw
his
new
path:
the
way
to
honor
the
memory
of
his
lost
people
was
to
pass
their
teachings
on
to
a
new
generation.
"The
edge
of
the
sharpest
blade
is
no
match
for
the
calm
of
the
peaceful
mind."
―
Master
Yi
Keeper
of
the
ancient
art
of
Wuju,
Master
Yi
is
a
mystical
warrior
from
the
isle
of
Ionia
.
He
descended
from
one
of
the
few
tribes
dedicated
to
the
preservation
of
Wuju,
a
martial
art
founded
with
the
principles
of
absolute
spiritual
awareness
of
one's
self
and
one's
enemy.
When
the
armies
of
Noxus
invaded
Ionia,
Master
Yi
joined
in
the
Ionian
defense
to
fight
the
craven
enemy,
bringing
his
village
honor
through
his
unparalleled
mastery
of
the
blade.
The
ensuing
battles
ravaged
the
land,
but
no
conflict
inflicted
as
much
horror
as
the
day
the
armies
of
Noxus
closed
in
on
Yi's
village.
Left
undefended,
the
village
became
the
unfortunate
test
subject
of
the
latest
invention
by
an
up-and-coming
chemist,
now
known
as
Singed
.
The
remains
of
the
village
that
Master
Yi
returned
to
were
so
horrific
that
it
remains
a
festering
scar
on
Ionian
history.
To
this
day,
no
Ionian
will
ever
publicly
speak
of
what
occurred.
After
the
Noxian
invasion
was
contained,
Master
Yi
fell
into
a
deep
isolation.
For
years,
he
trained
morning
to
night,
speaking
to
no
one
and
refusing
offers
of
consolation
by
fellow
Ionians.
The
only
thing
stopping
him
from
madly
charging
into
Noxus
battle
lines
headfirst
was
his
pledge
to
keep
the
Wuju
style
alive.
Even
though
he
seethed
with
impatience,
his
rage
became
a
tool
for
sharpening
his
practice
of
Wuju,
developing
stronger
and
deadlier
skills
for
his
eventual
vengeance.
The
only
thing
that
roused
him
was
news
of
the
League's
formation,
and
Noxus's
subsequent
enrollment
in
the
League.
Master
Yi
now
brings
his
mastery
of
the
blade
to
the
League
of
Legends
with
unflinching
purpose:
to
avenge
his
kinfolk
and
end
the
predations
of
the
Noxus
once
and
for
all.
"The
art
of
Wuju
lives
on
in
Master
Yi,
and
is
plunged
through
the
hearts
of
his
foes."
―
Soraka,
The
Starchild
If
asked,
Yi
will
tell
you
he
was
born
from
wisps
of
the
cosmos,
and
that
is
why
he
moves
like
the
wind.
Those
who
have
faced
him
in
combat
know
the
bite
of
the
Wuju
Bladesman
-
he
strikes
twice,
without
warning,
and
is
gone.
Often,
the
only
clue
that
you
are
about
to
be
struck
by
Master
Yi
is
the
hiss
of
his
blade
as
it
parts
the
air.
Keeper
of
the
ancient
art
of
Wuju,
Master
Yi
is
a
mystical
warrior
from
the
isle
of
Ionia
.
His
village
was
steeped
in
Wuju,
and
his
kinfolk
were
some
of
the
few
to
carry
the
tradition
into
the
modern
day.
That
is,
until
the
armies
of
Noxus
came
to
Ionia,
ravaging
the
land.
Master
Yi
went
to
fight
the
craven
enemy,
bringing
his
village
honor
through
his
unparalleled
mastery
of
the
blade.
However,
in
his
absence,
the
armies
of
Noxus
closed
in
and
tested
the
latest
invention
of
the
chemist
now
known
as
Singed
.
What
was
done
to
his
village
is
something
of
which
Master
Yi
will
not
speak.
However,
he
has
brought
his
mastery
of
the
blade
to
the
League
of
Legends
in
order
to
avenge
his
kinfolk
and
end
the
predations
of
the
Noxus
once
and
for
all.
Master
Yi
brings
the
art
of
the
Wuju
style
in
a
way
that
makes
his
enemies
falter.
He
is
capable
of
fighting
with
lightning
speed,
as
well
as
finding
purchase
behind
the
defenses
of
an
enemy's
armor.
He
can
call
on
his
inner
fortitude,
regenerating
at
an
accelerated
rate.
Calling
upon
ancient
forces,
Master
Yi
can
fold
space,
appearing
behind
enemy
after
enemy.
He
is
even
able
to
reject
magic,
rendering
it
useless
against
him.
Master
Yi
himself
has
studied
the
arts
of
Wuju
for
more
than
a
thousand
years.
He
is
the
oldest
known
living
human
on
Valoran,
but
to
gaze
upon
him,
you
would
guess
him
no
more
than
thirty
years
old.
The
art
of
Wuju
lives
on
in
Master
Yi,
and
is
plunged
through
the
hearts
of
his
foes.
[1]
Goggles
from
the
Revered
Inventor
The
goggles
Master
Yi
wears
are
a
techmaturgical
device
that
was
gifted
to
the
champion
by
Piltover's
own
Heimerdinger,
the
Revered
Inventor
.
Master
Yi
first
used
these
goggles
when
defending
his
homeland
from
Noxus
invaders
in
the
time
after
the
League
has
just
formed
and
before
Ionia
had
affiliated
itself
with
the
League.
The
goggles
are
fitted
specifically
for
Master
Yi;
while
someone
else
may
wear
them,
they
won't
receive
anywhere
near
the
same
benefit
as
he
does
himself.
The
one-of-a-kind
goggles,
known
as
the
"Seven
Lenses
of
Insight",
allow
Master
Yi
to
see
across
a
wider
range
of
the
spectrum
than
normal
people
see.
They
also
give
him
abilities
not
dissimilar
to
that
of
real
world
binoculars
and
telescopes.
The
goggles
are
synced
to
Yi's
own
magical
resonance,
allowing
him
to
adjust
settings
without
the
use
of
his
hands.
He
simply
thinks
what
he
needs,
and
the
goggles
act
accordingly.
