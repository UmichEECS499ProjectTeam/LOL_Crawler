Trivia
Cho'Gath
was
designed
by
Ezreal
and
Guinsoo
.
Cho'Gath's
name
is
likely
derived
from
"Shoggoth,"
an
otherworldly
monster
from
the
works
of
H.P.
Lovecraft
.
The
two
are
similar
in
that
they
are
alien
to
the
world
they
reside
in
(Valoran/Earth),
but
otherwise
they
do
not
share
much
similarities.
Another
possibility
is
that
it
is
derived
from
'Gath#.UV8sxJOTiVE
Ku'Gath
a
daemon
in
the
warhammer
40k
universe.
Cho'Gath
and
Ku'Gath
share
similar
names,
both
come
from
an
other
worldly
dimension,
the
void
and
the
warp
respectivly
and
both
are
large,
monstrous
beings.
Cho'Gath
is
the
first
champion
to
receive
a
second
legendary
skin,
though
Corki
has
two
skins
priced
1820
one
is
only
a
limited
skin.
Cho'Gath's
dance
is
the
same
as
Mickey
Mouse's
dance
in
Disney's
Fantasmic!
show
at
Disneyland.
Cho'Gath
ties
for
highest
base
damage
at
level
18
with
Skarner
(130).
Before
season
3,
the
icon
used
to
indicate
the
Tenacity
stat
on
champions
is
the
same
icon
of
his
Vorpal
Spikes
icon.
Cho'Gath's
icon
for
Feast
shows
an
inner
maw,
similar
to
that
of
the
aliens/xenomorphs
from
the
Alien
film
franchise.
Cho'Gath
may
be
inspired
by
the
popular
Japanese
movies
series,
Godzilla
,
as
Cho'Gath
bears
similarities
to
Destroyah's
first
form.
Cho'Gath
bears
a
resemblance
to
Malebogia
and
Violator
from
the
Spawn
franchise.
Riot
created
a
flash
minigame
called
Cho'Gath
Eats
the
World
for
April
Fool's
day.
Cho'Gath
is
the
only
Voidborn
with
a
name
containing
seven
letters
instead
of
six.
Quotes
"Ah,
the
tangled
webs
we
weave..."
is
a
reference
to
a
similar
line
from
the
epic
poem
Marmion
,
written
by
the
Scottish
poet
and
author
Sir
Walter
Scott
.
Cho'Gath
shares
this
quote
with
Elise
.
When
Cho'Gath
uses
his
Feast
,
he
will
sometimes
exclaim,
"Omnomnomnom."
This
is
a
direct
reference
to
the
Cookie
Monster
,
a
character
from
the
kids'
show,
Sesame
Street
.
Gentlemen
Cho'Gath
possesses
many
quotes
that
are
different
from
the
regular
Cho'gath.
The
line,
"I'll
bite
your
legs
off!"
is
a
reference
to
British
comedy
group
Monty
Python's
movie,
Monty
Python
and
the
Holy
Grail
,
where
the
Black
Knight
yells
the
same
line
after
being
defeated
and
dismembered
by
King
Arthur
.
The
line,
"It's
funny
isn't
it?
How
your
best
friend
can
just
blow
up
like
that."
is
a
quote
from
the
sketch
"
Mrs.
Niggerbaiter
Explodes
"
from
Monty
Python's
Flying
Circus
.
It
could
also
be
a
reference
to
Kog'Maw's
Icathian
Surprise
.
"I
like
a
man
who
grins
when
he
fights!"
is
a
reference
to
a
quote
spoken
by
Winston
Churchill
.
"One
can
survive
everything,
nowadays,
except
death,"
is
a
quote
from
19th
century
author
and
poet,
Oscar
Wilde
.
"Cake
or
death?"
is
a
question
asked
by
British
comedian
Eddie
Izzard
in
his
Dress
to
Kill
DVD.
The
answer
given
was,
"Uh,
death,
please.
No,
cake!
Cake!
Cake,
sorry.
Sorry..."
"Anything
less
would
be
uncivilized."
may
be
a
reference
to
Right
Guard
deodorant
commercials.
Battlecast
Prime
Cho'Gath's
quote,
"Maximum
Cho'Gath,"
is
likely
a
reference
to
the
Crysis
series.
Battlecast
Prime
Cho'Gath
and
Hecarim
share
a
quote,
"Crush
them
underfoot."
Skins
Teaser
for
Battlecast
Prime
Cho'Gath
skin
[2]
The
Loch
Ness
Cho'Gath
skin
is
a
reference
to
the
infamous
Loch
Ness
Monster
.
Gentleman
Cho'Gath's
clothing
and
voice
are
supposed
to
represent
gentlemen
from
the
19th
century.
Battlecast
Cho'Gath
skin
has
some
body
parts
similar
to
Machinedramon
from
Digimon
series.
Cho'Gath
is
currently
the
only
champion
in
the
game
to
possess
two
Legendary
skins
available
in
the
store,
Battlecast
Cho'Gath
and
Gentleman
Cho'Gath
Corki
was
the
first
to
have
2
Legendary
skins,
however,
both
are
currently
unavailable
for
purchase.
The
Gentleman
Cho'Gath
skin
was
the
first
champion
skin
ever
to
feature
a
voice-over
change.
In
the
spoiler
for
Battlecast
Cho'Gath,
in
the
top
right
are
the
names
XER
,
URG
,
SKA
,
MAW
and
ANV
.
This
is
likely
a
hint
at
the
other
Battlecast
skins
to
come.
Battlecast
Cho'Gath
appears
as
a
miniboss
in
Tokyo,
Japan
in
the
flash
mini-game,
Cho'Gath
Eats
the
World
.
Under
a
forum
thread
that
discussed
the
cancellation
of
Omen
,
Zileas
noted
that,
in
a
skins
meeting,
someone
once
suggested
a
"Japanese
Schoolgirl"
or
"Magical
Girl"
skin
for
Cho'Gath,
and
that
he
supports
its
creation.
On
the
schematic
for
Battlecast
Cho'Gath,
his
Feral
Scream
is
emitted
by
"451
Exawatt
Omnisonic
Speakers";
1
Exawatt
equals
1,000,000,000,000,000,000
watts.
For
reference,
451
Exawatts
is
almost
2600
times
the
power
Earth
receives
from
the
Sun.
In
1
second,
it
releases
more
energy
than
2000
Tsar
Bombas
,
the
most
powerful
nuclear
device
in
history,
or
100
gigatons
of
TNT.
Gentleman
Cho'Gath
has
a
personal
section
on
the
Latin
America
server,
where
he
discusses
--
in
extremely
old-fashonied
and
correct
spanish
--
the
use
of
proper
words
in
League
of
Legends.
He
warns
players
away
from
slang
derived
from
rough
English-Spanish
translations.
For
example,
"ganking"
is
referred
to
as
the
slangy
"gankear"
and
Gentleman
Cho'Gath
indicates
that
the
correct
term
should
be
"emboscar".
Relations
Cho'Gath,
Kha'Zix
,
Kog'Maw
and
Vel'Koz
are
all
creatures
of
the
Void
.
Kassadin
seeks
to
prevent
Voidborns
such
as
Cho'Gath
from
invading
Valoran
,
and
therefore
opposes
him.
On
the
other
hand,
Malzahar
seeks
to
release
the
void
to
the
world,
and
therefore
has
allied
with
Cho'Gath
for
natural
reasons.
