Details
Vault
is
a
targeted
dash
ability.

spell
effects
as
a
single
target
ability.
Spell
vamp
is
fully
applied.
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
will

Spell
shields
will
block
the

away
from
the
target.
Additional
Information:
After
completing
Vault,
Quinn
(or
Valor)
will
automatically
attempt
to
attack
the
target.
The
dash
cast
range
is
variable
but
the
bounce
range
is
constant.
As
such,
the
ability
can
be
used
to
either
lengthen
or
shorten
a
gap
between
two
units
depending
on
where
it
is
cast.
The
bounce
back
can
allow
Quinn
(or
Valor)
to
pass
through
walls,
permitting
she
has
sufficient
space
on
the
other
side
to
land.
Quinn
(or

will
track
and
follow

target
