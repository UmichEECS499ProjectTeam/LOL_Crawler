Skill
usage
Take
advantage
of
Headshot
for
harassing
enemy
champions
.
Caitlyn
is
superior
in
side
lanes
as
the
brush
makes
her
passive,
Headshot
,
more
effective.
It
is
not
recommended
to
harass
enemies
with
Piltover
Peacemaker
since
it
drains
mana
too
quickly
and
has
a
distinct
channeling
animation,
allowing
it
to
be
dodged.
Instead,
use
Yordle
Snap
Trap
to
disable
enemy
with
another
crowd
control
or
make
a
few
shots
on
them.
It
is
easier
to
hit
with
Piltover
Peacemaker
when
inside
brush
because
enemies
cannot
see
the
one-second
warning
before
the
shot.
Piltover
Peacemaker
will
push
the
lane
and
leveling
it
early
increases
the
pressure
on
your
lane.
During
the
laning
phase,
place
a
Yordle
Snap
Trap
in
side
routes
and
bushes
to
deny
the
enemy
team
the
use
of
those
bushes.
It
is
also
a
good
idea
to
set
up
Yordle
Snap
Trap
by
placing
all
3
in
a
straight
line
within
the
lane
to
limit
your
opponent's
mobility.
If
any
enemies
were
to
step
into
them
by
mistake
or
they
walk
through
the
small
passages
between
the
Yordle
Snap
Trap
,
this
allows
an
easy
setup
with
Piltover
Peacemaker
or
Headshot
.
If
you
place
a
Yordle
Snap
Trap
on
top
of
an
enemy
ward,
then
the
ward
will
become
visible
once
again
for
a
short
period
when
the
enemy
champ
steps
on
that
trap.
Yordle
Snap
Trap
is
better
than
Piltover
Peacemaker
as
a
first
skill
due
to
its
utility,
and
allows
for
Caitlyn
to
dominate
her
lane.
Piltover
Peacemaker
is
easy
to
juke,
but
if
an
enemy
steps
on
a
trap,
you
can
get
off
some
free
damage
on
them.
By
starting
off
with
Yordle
Snap
Trap
you
can
assist
your
jungler
by
placing
Yordle
Snap
Traps
at
common
jungle
locations;
this
can
be
used
to
help
your
jungler
counter-jungle.
When
in
team
fights,
placing
a
Yordle
Snap
Trap
in
front
of
enemies
or
behind
them
can
help
your
team
escape
if
losing
or
capture
fleeing
enemies.
When
fighting
against
Sivir
,
your
Yordle
Snap
Trap
will
be
less
effective
due
to
her
Spell
Shield
.
She
will
often
run
into
the
trap
with
her
Spell
Shield
activated
to
give
her
mana,
but
that
will
make
her
vulnerable
to
Ace
in
the
Hole
since
Spell
Shield
will
be
on
cooldown.
To
counter
an
enemy
Pantheon
or
Twisted
Fate
using
their
ultimate,
place
a
Yordle
Snap
Trap
in
the
center
of
the
circle
where
he
will
land,
snaring
and
effectively
crippling
him.
This
is
also
effective
against
targets
that
are
re-spawning
with
the
Guardian
Angel
buff,
placing
Yordle
Snap
Trap
under
them
helps
to
secure
the
kill.
You
can
fire
90
Caliber
Net
away
from
opponents
to
close
the
gap
when
chasing.
Inversely,
it
can
be
used
as
an
escaping
tool
as
well,
slowing
the
opponent
and
propelling
you
away.
90
Caliber
Net's
recoil
will
immediately
stop
you
when
you
hit
terrain
that
is
too
thick
to
move
through.
Caitlyn
can
use
90
Caliber
Net
to
hop
over
thin
walls
in
the
jungle,
creating
a
quick
escape
route
out
of
dangerous
situations.
She
also
can
use
this
functionality
to
pursue
enemies
effectively.
As
it
uses
a
bit
of
mana
and
has
a
long
cooldown
,
it
should
be
used
with
caution.
When
you
rapidly
use
90
Caliber
Net
and
activate
Piltover
Peacemaker
right
afterward
before
moving
(helps
to
use
smartcast),
you
move
away
as
usual
but
your
Q
also
goes
off
from
where
you
were
standing
before
moving
with
no
animation.
Avoid
using
Ace
in
the
Hole
in
large
team
clashes
as
it
might
be
blocked
by
another
enemy
champion.
The
cast
also
cancels
if
the
target
dies
prematurely.
Using
Ace
in
the
Hole
at
an
angle
that
the
enemy
team
would
not
expect
makes
it
more
difficult
for
it
to
be
blocked.
When
an
enemy
flees
at
low
health
,
you
can
finish
them
off
with
Ace
in
the
Hole
.
However,
remember
that
it
can
be
intercepted,
so
try
to
find
a
clear
shot
first.
Ace
in
the
Hole
requires
vision
of
the
enemy
to
cast.
Having
an
ally
with
Clairvoyance
can
help
finish
off
low-health
enemies.
Because
Yordle
Snap
Trap
grants
vision
of
an
enemy
who
steps
on
it,
be
sure
to
place
them
strategically
and
keep
an
eye
on
them.
You
may
be
able
to
get
a
surprise
Ace
in
the
Hole
off
of
someone
who
triggers
it
in
the
bush
or
jungle,
allowing
you
to
either
hurt
them
to
prevent
a
gank
or
finish
them
off
if
they
fled
to
the
jungle.
Build
usage
Building
one
or
two
items
that
focus
on
attack
speed
,
such
as
Phantom
Dancer
or
Statikk
Shiv
,
will
charge
Headshot
faster,
improving
her
damage
in
the
later
part
of
the
game.
Phantom
Dancer
is
especially
useful
as
Caitlyn
,
as
with
most
physical
DPS
champions.
Statikk
Shiv
gives
her
inferior
stats,
but
greater
waveclear
and
at
a
lower
price.
Runaan's
Hurricane
enables
Caitlyn
to
get
Headshot
procs
three
times
faster,
but
gives
few
useful
stats.
Blade
of
the
Ruined
King
gives
Caitlyn
increased
dueling
and
chasing
capability,
as
well
as
higher
damage
to
health
tanks
such
as
Dr.
Mundo
.
The
auto-attack
part
of
Headshot
calculates
with
critical
strikes,
so
items
that
offer
critical
chance
also
add
greatly
to
her
damage
capacity;
however
the
on-hit
added
damage
of
Headshot
does
not
crit.
The
Bloodthirster
is
an
excellent
item
on
Caitlyn
as
she
can
easily
farm
stacks
with
Piltover
Peacemaker
.
It
grants
a
massive
amount
of
attack
damage
,
and
the
life
steal
greatly
improves
your
sustainability
and
improves
your
abilities
as
they
scale
greatly
with
AD.
Buying
the
component
Vampiric
Scepter
early
can
help
extend
the
amount
of
time
you
can
remain
in
your
lane.
Building
Caitlyn
with
Phantom
Dancer
and
Infinity
Edge
will
allow
her
to
do
high
damage
in
team
fights
before
she
gets
focused.
An
effective
build
is
to
get
2
Ã—
Phantom
Dancer
and
an
Infinity
Edge
.
However,
rushing
an
Infinity
Edge
before
a
Phantom
Dancer
is
highly
recommended
for
the
better
damage
and
minion
farming,
if
you
can
get
enough
minions/kills
early
game.

Countering
Unlike
most
carries
,
Caitlyn
has
very
high
attack
damage
early-game
due
to
her
superior
range
and
Headshot
passive,
that
allows
her
to
harass
her
enemies,
whittling
down
and
possibly
forcing
them
out
of
lane
out
of
fear
of
getting
killed
by
Caitlyn's
Ace
in
the
Hole
.
Caitlyn
can
win
a
lane
through
denying
enemy
carries
from
farming,
but
does
not
have
a
"steroid"
ability.
Supports
that
can
zone
her,
such
as
Alistar
,
Janna
,
Lux
are
an
effective
counter.
Caitlyn
is
well
known
for
being
an
unusually
strong
ADC
early
on
and
severely
shuts
down
weak
starters
like
Kog'Maw
,
however
in
comparison
to
most
of
the
other
ADC
she
becomes
weak
by
the
late-game.
Be
aware
of
where
Caitlyn's
traps
are
as
Yordle
Snap
Trap
+
Piltover
Peacemaker
combo
is
devastating
early
game.
Effective
for
preventing
Caitlyn
getting
kills
with
Ace
in
the
Hole
are
supports,
such
as
Alistar
,
Kayle
,
Lulu
,
Soraka
,
that
can
interrupt
her
ultimate
or
help
the
targeted
ally
:
Alistar
,
Lulu
,
Soraka
can
interrupt
it
respectively
with
-
Pulverize
and
Headbutt
,
Whimsy
,
Infuse
.
Alistar
also
can
intercept
the
ultimate
even
at
low
health
and
survive
it
with
his
Unbreakable
Will
.
Additionally
Lulu's
Wild
Growth
and
Help,
Pix!
,
Kayle's
Divine
Blessing
,
Soraka's
Astral
Blessing
and
Wish
can
provide
the
target
with
just
enough
health
to
survive.
Perhaps
most
effective
is
Kayle's
Intervention
as
it
will
completely
nullify
the
damage
of
Ace
in
the
Hole
.
