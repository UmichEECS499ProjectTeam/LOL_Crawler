Trivia
Jinx
as
seen
on
Pool
Party
Graves
skin
splash
art.
Jinx's
arm
and
feet
in
the
foreground
Jinx
was
designed
by
RiotTeaTime
,
Gypsylord
and
Ransom
.
[3]
Jinx
is
voiced
by
Sarah
Anne
Williams.
Prior
to
her
reveal,
Ransom
described
Jinx
as
having
a
unique
personality
and
a
hair
color
shared
by
only
one
other
champion
.
Jinx
was
inspired
by
the
Joker,
Gollum,
and
Helena
Bonham
Carter.
This
was
noted
here
by
one
of
her
concept
and
splash
artists,
RiotTeaTime.
The
first
reference
to
Jinx's
name
was
in
a
post
made
by
CertainlyT
about
the
next
champion,
"No
(tm)?
You've
jinxed
us."
[4]
Jinx
made
her
first
appearance
in
the
Pool
Party
Graves
splash
art,
and
her
second
appearance
in
the
Pool
Party
Poster.
Jinx's
weapon
On
September
20th,
Jinx
committed
an
act
of
vandalism
on
Vi's
champion
page
on
the
League
of
Legends
website.
She
signed
it
with
"X
wuz
here".
[5]
The
wanted
poster
in
Jinx's
reveal
lists
her
crimes
as:
murder,
unprovoked
assault,
disturbing
the
peace,
public
indecency,
murder
again,
unauthorized
property
re-coloration,
unflattering
impersonation
of
an
officer,
reckless
hexplosive
detonation,
destruction
of
the
peace,
really
petty
larceny,
exorbitant
weapon
size,
some
more
murders,
inciting
mass
hysteria,
making
fun
of
the
peace,
aggravated
jaywalking
and
forging
of
official
wanted
posters
.
Her
dance
animation
is
a
reference
to
Jake
the
Dog
from
the
television
series
Adventure
Time
.
A
side
by
side
comparison
can
be
seen
here
Interestingly,
VI,
X
and
C
are
all
Roman
numerals.
This
has
caused
some
players
to
speculate
that
they
refer
to
a
rank
structure
or
nicknames
in
Vi's
old
gang.
C
is
a
character
described
in
Caitlyn's
lore,
her
arch-nemesis.
Though
a
coincidence,
the
Roman
numeral
CXVI
represents
116;
Jinx
is
the
116th
champion.
The
only
other
properly-formed
numeral
that
can
be
made
using
C,
X,
and
VI,
is
XCVI
(96).
The
Official
League
of
Legends
site
confirms
that
Jinx
is
from
Zaun.
There
is
an
in-game
event
whenever
Jinx
is
against
Vi
and/or
Caitlyn
,
called
Catch
me
if
you
can!
Jinx
can
be
seen
in
Officer
Vi's
splash
art
in
the
middle
of
a
giant
donut
in
the
background.
Jinx,
like
many
champions,
has
had
her
portrait
modified
so
that
it
is
more
clear/defined
on
the
in-game
map.
When
Jinx's
ultimate
explodes
a
smiley
face
appears
in
the
blast
radius,
lasting
for
a
second.
Jinx
is
the
first
champion
to
have
a
laugh
animation
that
automatically
loops.
Jinx's
minigun,
Pow-Pow,
wears
a
small
pair
of
bunny
ears
which
are
visible
near
her
right
arm.
When
Jinx
dies,
her
hair
forms
a
heart.
Jinx
is
similiar
to
Harley
Quinn,
from
comic
book
hero
the
Batman.
Quotes
Jinx's
quote
"Say
hello
to
my
friends
of
varying
sizes!"
is
a
parody
of
Tony
Montana's
infamous
quote
from
the
movie
Scarface
.
This
quote
is
also
a
double
entendre,
as
she
is
both
referring
to
the
varying
sizes
of
her
"friends"
and
the
fact
that
each
of
her
guns
has
variable
size
(between
compact
while
stored,
and
huge
while
in-use).
Her
quotes
upon
using
Super
Mega
Death
Rocket!
plays
homage
to
similar
lines
from
the
Worms
videogames
which
are
played
on
firing
Bazooka-type
weapons.
"I'm
bringing
guns
to
the
knife
fight!
Hehe."
is
a
playful
parody
of
Jimmy
Malone's
quote
"Isn't
that
just
like
a
wop?
Brings
a
knife
to
a
gun
fight."
from
the
movie
The
Untouchables
.
"'She's
such
a
loser,
always
ready
to
cry!'
T-T-T-Ta!"
is
sung
to
the
same
melody
as
Vi's
login
theme,
as
well
as
being
a
reference
to
the
lyrics
of
the
song
itself.
"Jinx?
Stands
for
Jinx!
Durr."
is
a
paired
joke
with
Vi's
quotes,
"
Vi?
Stands
for
Violence
/
Vice
/
Vicious.
"
Jinx's
"
Three
guns
means
never
having
to
say
I'm
sorry.
"
is
homage
to
the
famous
quote
from
the
1970's
Movie
'
Love
Story
.'
Jinx's
"
Let's
just
behave...
said
no
one,
ever."
is
a
reference
to
a
popular
internet
meme
Said
No
One
Ever
.
Jinx's
quote
"What
if
I
had
a
gun
that
shot
other
guns?"
is
a
straight
reference
to
the
"gun
that
shoots
other
guns"
meme.
Jinx's
quote
"I'm
wearing
lots
of
belts!
For
no
reason
at
all."
may
be
a
reference
to
Tetsuya
Nomura
's
habit
of
adding
belts
to
final
fantasy's
character
designs
like
so
.
Skins
Classic
Jinx
The
background
of
her
classic
skin
is
the
same
as
Vi's
classic
skin,
only
ruined
after
her
spree
of
crimes
through
Piltover.
Her
outfit
is
described
as
Zaun
's
street
fashion.
Under
Jinxs
right
leg
there
is
writing
sprayed
on
the
wall.
Most
of
the
text
is
hidden
and
impossible
to
read,
there
seems
to
be
a
repetition
of
"HE",
indicating
Jinx
wrote
it
as
her
laughter,
"HE
HE
HE".
Mafia
Jinx
Jinx
is
dressed
as
a
flapper
.
Gangster
Twitch
,
Mafia
Miss
Fortune
and
Urgot
can
be
seen
in
the
background.
The
same
kind
of
blue
cards
that
Twisted
Fate
uses
can
be
seen
at
the
bottom
of
Mafia
Jinx's
splash
art.
In
this
skin
Pow-Pow
the
minigun
becomes
a
violin
case,
referencing
a
common
cliche
in
Noir
stories
where
gangsters
conceal
firearms,
such
as
a
Thomson
sub-machine
gun,
in
instrument
cases
for
attacks
on
rivals.
Her
dance
animation
is
a
reference
to
the
1920's
"The
Charleston".
A
side-by-side
comparison
can
be
seen
here
.
Relations
She
has
an
antagonistic
relationship
with
Vi
.
It
is
heavily
implied
that
Jinx
and
Vi
are
sisters,
although
every
time
Riot
is
presented
the
question
they
deflect
with
more
fuel
without
specifically
confirming.
[6]
It
has
been
confirmed
that
each
champion
has
a
sister,
and
we've
heard
many
things
about
"Jinx's
sister"
and
"Vi's
sister"
-
however,
their
names
have
never
been
used
in
context
of
each
other.
[7]
[8]
It
is
apparent
from
Jinx's
reveal
that
Vi
does
not
know
or
recognize
Jinx.
Interestingly,
the
two
are
strongly
emphasized
on
their
being
opposites.
Vi
has
short
pink
hair
and
blue
eyes,
is
one
of
the
tallest
females,
has
a
more
filled
out
body,
uses
melee
combat
and
is
fully
armored
while
Jinx
has
long
blue
hair
and
pink
eyes,
is
short,
uses
ranged
combat
and
is
barely
clothed.
It's
entirely
possible
that
the
two
are
not
actually
sisters
and
that
Riot
hasn't
confirmed
their
relationship
because
it's
not
true
-
and
that
Riot
is
merely
enjoying
the
community's
reaction
while
knowing
that
each
champion's
sister
is
still
on
the
way.
This
is
supported
by
one
of
Jinx's
quotes,
"You
think
I'm
crazy?
You
should
see
my
sister.",
as
Vi's
personality/theme
does
not
really
fit
that
description.
The
possibility
that
they
might
not
be
sisters
at
all
can
also
be
backed
up
by
Lyte
's
quote
from
the
Howling
Abyss
to
Vi
:
"You
look
like
your
sister!
Er,
wait,
I'm
not
supposed
to
talk
about
that...".
Vi
and
Jinx
bear
no
resemblance
to
one
another
in
terms
of
appearance.
The
sister
he's
talking
about
could
be
someone
we
haven't
been
introduced
to
yet.
According
to
a
Reddit
AMA,
Jinx
wants
to
hug
Ziggs.
Ziggs,
however,
is
quite
terrified
of
Jinx.

Lyrics
Blah
blah
blablah.
Wanna
join
me,
come
and
play.
But
I
might
shoot
you,
in
your
face.
Bombs
and
bullets
will,
do
the
trick.
What
we
need
here,
is
a
little
bit
of
panic!
Do
you
ever
wanna
catch
me?
Right
now
I'm
feeling
ignored!
So
can
you
try
a
little
harder?
I'm
really
getting
bored!
Come
on,
shoot
faster,
Just
a
little
bit
of
energy!
I
wanna
try
something
fun
right
now,
I
guess
some
people
call
it
anarchy!
Let's
blow
this
city
to
ashes,
And
see
what
Pow-Pow
thinks.
It's
such
pathetic
neatness,
But
not
for
long
'cause
it'll
get
jinxed!
So
much
better,
so
much
fun.
Let's
start
from
scratch
and,
blow
up
the
sun!
Come
on,
shoot
faster,
Just
a
little
bit
of
energy!
I
wanna
try
something
fun
right
now,
I
guess
some
people
call
it
anarchy!
Let's
blow
this
city
to
ashes,
And
see
what
Pow-Pow
thinks.
It's
such
pathetic
neatness,
But
not
for
long
'cause
it'll
get
jinxed!
Come
on!
Come
on!
And
get
jinxed!
