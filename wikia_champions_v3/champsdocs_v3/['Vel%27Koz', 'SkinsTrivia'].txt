Trivia
Vel'Koz
was
the
first
champion
released
in
2014.
Vel'Koz
was
designed
by
Subninja
.
[1]
Vel'Koz
is
voiced
by
Erik
Braa
.
Vel'Koz's
lore
is
the
first
to
be
told
in
first-person.
The
Koz
in
Vel'Koz
came
from
one
of
his
names
during
development,
The
Keeper
of
Secrets.
The
Vel
part
could
be
attributed
to
the
word
"Velocity",
a
standard
measurement
of
an
objects
speed
(perhaps
a
reference
to
his
victims
fleeing
on
sight
of
him).
Vel'Koz's
mission
is
to
learn
about
Valoran.
Unfortunately,
Vel'Koz's
means
of
investigation
involves
disintegration
—requiring
him
to
first
decide
if
a
subject
is
worth
destroying
in
order
to
learn
their
functionality.
The
community
has
jokingly
labelled
his
scanner
the
"Learn
Beam".
For
example,
you
can
see
it
here
or
here
Vel'Koz's
full
attack
damage
per
level
is
+3.
141592
—that
is,
pi
.
Vel'Koz's
taunt
appear
as
a
Schrödinger's
equation
written
in
Visitor
Language
fromm
American
alien
science-fiction
franchise
V
.
Vel'Koz
first
appeared
in
Creator
Viktor's
splash
artwork,
albeit
in
his
Battlecast
skin.
Vel'Koz
made
a
series
of
appearances
on
YouTube
prior
to
his
release.
Prior
to
release,
Vel'Koz
was
speculated
to
be
in
some
way,
related
to
The
Watchers
,
who
were
referred
to
in
Lissandra's
'
s
lore.
[2]
Speculation
about
this
relationship
first
arose
due
to
visual
similarities
between
Vel'Koz
and
the
many
statues
that
can
be
found
in
the
Howling
Abyss
,
as
well
as
the
symbol
of
the
Frostguard;
and
a
direct
interpretation
of
Lissandra's
quote:
Play
"Avarosa
drove
[The
Watchers]
howling
into
the
Abyss
."
However,
in
the
Vel'Koz
AMA
on
Reddit,
the
developers
said
that
Vel'Koz
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
Watchers,
however
it
has
been
hinted
that
a
void
portal
in
Freljord
is
posible.
Ironically,
and
possibly
intentionally,
Vel'Koz
was
revealed
on
The
Day
We
Fight
Back
,
an
international
event
held
in
protest
of
surveillance.
Each
of
Vel'Koz's
eyes
are
capable
of
being
removed
from
the
body;
the
largest
is
even
capable
of
independent
flight.
Vel'Koz
can
be
categorized
as
an
Oculothorax
,
a
common
trope
in
sci-fi
and
fantasy.
Other
examples
include:
Shuma-Gorath
,
the
Eye
of
Sauron
and
Beholders
.
In
particular,
Vel'Koz
draws
many
parallels
with
Hermaeus
Mora
,
the
Daedric
Prince
of
Knowledge
from
the
Elder
Scrolls,
in
terms
of
appearance
and
general
theme.
Vel'Koz's
original
voice
script
was
intended
to
have
more
humor,
with
Vel'Koz
in
on
his
own
joke.
However,
it
was
decided
that
"amoral
and
heartless"
was
a
better
theme
and
his
script
was
made
to
sound
more
creepy.
Quotes
Vel'Koz
shares
the
quote
"Let's
see
what
they're
made
of,"
with
Rengar
.
His
quote
'thank
you
for
your
contribution'
is
a
reference
to
the
movie
Eagle
Eye
.
Skins

Battlecast
Vel'Koz
Battlecast
Vel'Koz
features
a
robotic
voice-filter
and
unique
quotes
for
Kassadin
,
Zilean
,
Yordles
and
the
Howling
Abyss
.
Battlecast
Vel'Koz's
appearance
bears
some
resemblance
to
the
Sentinels
from
the
Matrix
franchise.
This
similarity
is
especially
noticeable
during
Vel'Koz's
enhanced
movement
animation.
Creator
Viktor
and
Battlecast
Prime
Cho'Gath
can
be
seen
in
the
splash
art,
as
well
as
an
as
of
now
unidentified
silhouette
that
also
appears
Creator
Viktor's
recall
animation.
Pre-Release
The
following
hints
were
dropped
about
Vel'Koz
prior
to
his
unveiling:
I'm
a
little
sad
it's
premature
to
start
hinting
at
the
next
champ.
I've
been
eyeballing
some
amazing
puns
for
when
the
time
is
right.
Since
you
guys
will
read
way
too
much
into
everything
I
say,
I'll
try
to
remember
that
silence
is
golden
and
all
of
the
cake
in
this
post
is
a
lie
.
―Xelnath
I
haven't
checked
the
launch
date
of
the
next
champ
yet.
[...]
It
will
be
a
fun
champ,
though.
Nothing
you'll
see
coming.
―RiotBrokenSword
Oh,
and
keep
an
eye
out
for
an
invasion
from
the
Outside
.

Relations
Despite
being
a
creature
from
The
Void
,
Vel'Koz
does
not
ally
himself
with
Cho'Gath
,
Kha'Zix
,
Kog'Maw
and
Malzahar
.
Vel'Koz
views
other
voidlings
as
a
primitive
nuisance,
because
they
tend
to
eat
and
destroy
everything
before
he
can
analyze
his
environment.
Since
they
get
in
his
way
of
gathering
information,
he
doesn't
mind
resorting
to
killing
them.
Kassadin
stands
against
the
invasion
from
the
Void,
making
him
one
of
Vel'Koz's
enemies.
Vel'Koz's
Battlecast
augmentations
are
courtesy
of
Viktor
,
who
has
augmented
many
of
the
other
Void
champions
as
part
of
his
Evolution
.
Vel'Koz
is
currently
searching
for
Zilean
believing
that
he
holds
the
ultimate
knowledge
for
he
has
seen
the
world
in
its
past
and
future
states.
