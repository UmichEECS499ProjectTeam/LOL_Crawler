Trivia
Lucian
was
designed
by
Daniel
'
ZenonTheStoic'
Klein.
His
lore
was
written
by
'
RiotRunaan'
.
Lucian
is
voiced
by
Patrick
Seitz
,
who
also
voices
Kog'Maw
,
Renekton
and
Rengar
.
The
two
pictures
in
the
post
where
Lucian
was
officially
revealed
show
an
L
engraved
into
one
pistol
and
an
S
in
the
other.
The
L
stands
for
Lucian,
the
S
for
Lucian's
late
wife
-
Senna.
After
Senna's
soul
was
trapped
by
Thresh
,
Lucian
started
using
Senna's
pistol
as
well
as
his
own.
In
game,
the
gun
in
Lucian's
right
hand
-
the
less
ornate
white
one
-
is
his.
The
gun
with
the
more
intricate
design
is
his
wife,
Senna's.
[3]
Due
to
his
leaked
concept
art
some
people
speculated
that
the
S
and
L
that
is
engraved
on
the
guns
stood
for
Shadow
and
Light
receptively
due
to
the
guns
having
a
light
and
dark
theme.
This
idea
also
came
from
his
reveal
when
he
said
"
Not
just
anyone
can
wield
these
weapons.
You
need
a
pure
heart.
A
fearless
mind.
An
inner
light
that
outshines
all
the
darkness
in
the
world.
Once
I
had
that
light.
Now
I'm
not
so
sure"
thus
lead
people
to
believe
that
he
will
have
some
shadow
and
light
based
abilities.
Lucian's
leaked
champion
title
was
"the
Gun
Templar"
however
when
he
was
released
his
title
changed
to
"the
Purifier."
Interestingly
enough
in
the
Polish
reveal
he
was
referred
to
as
the
Gun
Templar,
but
probably
is
a
miscommunication
between
the
staff.
It's
also
interesting
to
note
that
the
first
time
his
teaser
was
revealed
the
Riot
poster
was
named
Lucian
the
Gun
Templar,
however
it
got
changed
into
Lucian,
the
Purifier.
The
Culling
is
the
first
ability
in
the
game
to
directly
scale
with
attack
speed.
It
is
also
a
new
mechanic
that
allows
him
to
fire
backwards
while
moving.
When
first
revealed
in
the
Public
beta
,
The
Culling
could
deal
over
10,000
damage
with
a
build
consisting
of
5
x
Nashor's
Tooth
and
Rabadon's
Deathcap
.
Subsequent
changes
to
the
ability's
AP
ratio
has
seen
this
build's
damage
output
being
reduced
to
3800.
A
build
consisting
of
5
x
Zephyr
and
The
Bloodthirster
will
achieve
the
same
amount
of
damage
while
also
granting
stacking
CDR
and
movement
speed,
and
decent
attack
damage
and
lifesteal
for
while
The
Culling
is
on
cooldown.
It
should
be
noted,
however,
that
The
Culling's
damage
scales
more
efficiently
with
attack
damage
builds
than
attack
speed
builds.
Lucian
is
from
Demacia
.
[4]
Lucian's
recall
animation
is
the
same
pose
performed
by
John
Preston,
the
protagonist
of
Equilibrium.
A
side
by
side
comparison
can
be
seen
here
.
Lucian's
dance
is
a
reference
to
Revolver
Ocelot
from
the
Metal
Gear
series.
A
side
by
side
comparison
can
be
seen
here
.
Lucian's
theme,
The
Purifier's
Resolve
,
was
composed
and
performed
by
The
Crystal
Method
.
Lucian's
log-in
screen
is
the
first
login
to
have
an
animated
sequence
before
the
actual
log-in.
The
animation
also
shows
the
soul
of
his
wife,
Senna.
The
Crystal
Method
did
a
live
performance
of
The
Purifier's
Resolve
as
part
of
the
opening
ceremony
for
the
Season
3
World
Championship
Finals.
Quotes
Lucian's
taunt
"Death
at
the
door?
Hmph,
no,
I
am
the
one
who
knocks."
is
a
reference
to
a
well-known
quote
from
the
Breaking
Bad
television
series.
Lucian's
quote
"Everybody
deserves
a
second
shot."
may
be
a
reference
to
a
double
tap
-
a
shooting
technique
where
two
shots
are
fired
at
the
same
body
part
within
a
few
seconds
of
each
other.
It
may
also
be
a
reference
to
Lucian's
passive,
Lightslinger
,
which
resembles
a
double
tap.
Skins
It
was
hinted
prior
to
Lucian's
release
that
his
release
skin
would
have
"four
eyes",
referencing
sunglasses.
Hired
Gun
Lucian
seems
to
be
a
reference
to
both
Morpheus
and
The
Twins
from
The
Matrix
.
Its
Recall
animation
features
Lucian
taking
out
red
and
blue
vials
before
drinking
from
the
blue
one,
another
reference
to
the
Matrix.
Lucian
shares
the
Hired
Gun
skin
theme
with
Graves
.
The
weapon
Hired
Gun
Lucian
wields
in
his
left
hand
closely
resembles
the
Hextech
Gunblade
.
Hired
Gun
Lucian
will
fire
a
specially
animated
'exploding'
bolt
when
a
basic
attack
procs
a
critical
hit.
Relationships
Lucian's
reveal
on
the
Russian
website
featured
a
different
image
of
the
second
gun.
In
this
image,
it
is
made
apparent
that
the
stone
is
in
fact
a
memorial
plaque
for
Lucian's
"beloved
wife"
Senna.
