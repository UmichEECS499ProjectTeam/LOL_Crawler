Trivia
Twitch's
design
closely
resembles
that
of
the
Skaven
,
a
devious
and
warlike
race
of
anthropomorphic
rats
from
the
Warhammer
Fantasy
franchise.
The
Medieval
skin
reflects
this
similarity
more
than
his
original
skin.
Spray
and
Pray
is
a
generic
phrase
used
to
describe
the
random
spraying
of
bullets
with
an
automatic
weapon
hoping
to
hit
something.
Twitch
was
designed
by
Guinsoo
.
[1]
.
Deadly
Venom
displays
an
"X"
symbol
upon
reaching
6
stacks.
This
is
most
likely
a
reference
about
how
infected
houses
during
the
Bubonic
Plague
would
be
marked
with
an
"X"
on
the
door.
Twitch's
title
is
likely
a
reference
to
the
Bubonic
Plague
,
which
killed
millions
in
Europe
during
Medieval
times,
and
was
transmitted
by
rats
or
more
specificly,
their
fleas.
Skins
Gangster
Twitch
may
be
a
reference
to
the
Toon
Patrol
weasels
from
Who
Framed
Roger
Rabbit
,
or
to
the
actor
James
Cagney
who
is
famous
for
portraying
a
gangster
and
his
misquoted
line,
"MMMmmm,
you
dirty
rat!".
It
is
also
believed
to
be
a
reference
to
Pinstripe
Potoroo
,
the
fourth
Boss
in
the
first
Crash
Bandicoot.
Gangster
Twitch
,
Mafia
Graves
,
Mafia
Miss
Fortune
and
Mafia
Jinx
share
a
Mafia
theme.
Medieval
Twitch
was
conceived
by
the
2
people
that
first
hit
350
friend
referrals:
Grez
and
Greyrir
Wolfwood.
Grez
picked
the
champion
that
would
receive
the
skin,
and
Greyrir
Wolfwood
designed
a
"Medieval
Twitch,
with
a
fleur-de-lis
on
his
cape,
and
a
pot
on
his
head".
The
idea
was
given
to
the
Riot
artists
and
Medieval
Twitch
was
released
a
few
months
later.
Medieval
Twitch
holds
the
distinction
for
being
the
rarest
skin
in
the
game.
Vandal
Twitch
,
Vandal
Brand
,
Vandal
Gragas
,
Vandal
Vladimir
,
Vandal
Jax
all
share
a
Vandal
theme.
