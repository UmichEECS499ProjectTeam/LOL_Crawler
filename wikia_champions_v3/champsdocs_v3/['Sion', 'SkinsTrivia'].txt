Trivia
Sion
was
designed
by
Colt
'Ezreal'
Hallam
.
Sion
is
voiced
by
J.S.
Gilbert,
Who
also
voices
Battlecast
Prime
Cho'Gath
,
Dr.
Mundo
,
Gragas
and
Udyr
.
Sion's
Dance
is
reminiscent
of
"Moskau"
by
Dschinghis
Khan.
A
side-by-side
comparison
can
be
seen
here
Sion
was
one
of
the
first
six
characters
designed,
along
with
Singed
,
Annie
,
Sivir
,
Twisted
Fate
and
Lee
Sin
[1]
[2]
Sion
was
one
of
the
champions
available
for
the
Noxian
pool
during
the
Ionia
vs.
Noxus
match
,
and
was
one
of
the
selected
champions.
Feel
No
Pain
was
possibly
taken
from
the
Warhammer
40,000
table
top
game,
where
it
is
a
special
rule
that
gives
units
a
chance
to
ignore
wounds.
Sion
is
one
of
four
champions
that
can
infinitely
increase
their
stats
by
using
their
abilities,
in
Sion's
case
it's
his
health
.
The
other
three
are
Nasus
,
Thresh
and
Veigar
.
Quotes
Many
of
Sion's
quotes
are
based
on
old
Arnold
Schwarzenegger
movies.
Sion's
quote
"Get
on
my
Chopper!"
is
a
reference
to
Arnold
Schwarzenegger's
famous
line
"Get
to
the
Chopper!"
from
the
movie
Predator
.
Sion's
quote
"Who
is
your
summoner,
and
what
does
he
do?"
is
a
reference
to
Kindergarten
Cop
.
Sion's
taunt
is
a
reference
to
an
exchange
in
the
1982
movie
Conan
the
Barbarian
between
the
Mongol
General
and
Conan.
Sion's
joke
is
a
reference
to
Dem
Bones
.
Sion
shares
a
quote
with
Kayle
-
"Lead
me
to
battle"
.
Skins
Hextech
Sion
is
a
reference
to
the
Terminator
franchise.
Hextech
Sion's
robotic
eye
is
on
the
right
of
the
original
artwork,
but
on
the
left
in
the
Chinese
artwork.
Barbarian
Sion
is
a
reference
to
the
character
Conan
the
Barbarian
.
Sion's
character
model
now
shows
him
wielding
a
double-bladed
axe,
as
he
does
in
his
Warmonger
and
Barbarian
skins,
rather
than
the
classic
single-bladed
axe
that
still
currently
appear
in
both
of
his
classic
skin
artworks.
Lumberjack
Sion
skin
could
be
a
reference
to
Paul
Bunyan,
with
Unchained
Alistar
as
the
reference
to
Babe,
the
Blue
Ox.
Lumberjack
Sion
may
also
be
a
reference
to
Mark
Kaminsky
-
character
from
movie
Raw
Deal
,
played
by
Arnold
Schwarzenegger.
