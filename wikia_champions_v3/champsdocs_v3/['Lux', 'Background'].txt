Lux
Born
to
the
prestigious
Crownguards,
the
paragon
family
of
Demacian
service,
Luxanna
was
destined
for
greatness.
She
grew
up
as
the
family’s
only
daughter,
and
she
immediately
took
to
the
advanced
education
and
lavish
parties
required
of
families
as
high
profile
as
the
Crownguards.
As
Lux
matured,
it
became
clear
that
she
was
extraordinarily
gifted.
She
could
play
tricks
that
made
people
believe
they
had
seen
things
that
did
not
actually
exist.
She
could
also
hide
in
plain
sight.
Somehow,
she
was
able
to
reverse
engineer
arcane
magical
spells
after
seeing
them
cast
only
once.
She
was
hailed
as
a
prodigy,
drawing
the
affections
of
the
Demacian
government,
military,
and
citizens
alike.
As
one
of
the
youngest
women
to
be
tested
by
the
College
of
Magic,
she
was
discovered
to
possess
a
unique
command
over
the
powers
of
light.
The
young
Lux
viewed
this
as
a
great
gift,
something
for
her
to
embrace
and
use
in
the
name
of
good.
Realizing
her
unique
skills,
the
Demacian
military
recruited
and
trained
her
in
covert
operations.
She
quickly
became
renowned
for
her
daring
achievements;
the
most
dangerous
of
which
found
her
deep
in
the
chambers
of
the
Noxian
High
Command.
She
extracted
valuable
inside
information
about
the
Noxus
-
Ionian
conflict,
earning
her
great
favor
with
Demacians
and
Ionians
alike.
However,
reconnaissance
and
surveillance
was
not
for
her.
A
light
of
her
people,
Lux's
true
calling
was
the
League
of
Legends
,
where
she
could
follow
in
her
brother’s
footsteps
and
unleash
her
gifts
as
an
inspiration
for
all
of
Demacia.
"Her
guiding
light
makes
enemies
wary,
but
they
should
worry
most
when
the
light
fades."
―
Garen,
the
Might
of
Demacia

Candidate:

CLE
OBSERVATION
Lux
runs
briskly
into
the
hallway,
almost
bursting
with
excitement.
The
light
plays
off
of
the
young
girl’s
golden
hair,
emitting
a
brightness
that
almost
gives
her
an
ethereal
air.
Her
colorful
attire
and
disarming
smile
would
fool
any
ignorant
passerby,
but
the
ease
with
which
she
wears
her
battle
armor
would
give
any
seasoned
warrior
pause.
She
pauses
for
a
moment
to
take
in
the
scenery,
her
intelligent
eyes
darting
around.
An
intricate
baton
darts
rapidly
between
her
fingers,
conveying
her
impatience.
The
truest
opponent
lies
within.
An
unimpressed
“hmph”
spills
out
of
her
lips.
Striding
forward,
she
pushes
firmly
with
a
gloved
hand
to
open
the
marble
doors
before
her.
With
an
effortless
spin
of
her
baton,
her
body
is
enveloped
in
a
bright
aura.
She
runs
inside,
undaunted
by
the
complete
darkness
that
swallows
her
up.
REFLECTION
Garen,
the
Might
of
Demacia,
her
long-lost
brother,
stood
before
her.
His
face
was
stern,
yet
kind,
and
exactly
how
she
had
imagined
he
would
look
in
real
life,
having
only
seen
him
in
the
League
match
broadcasts
since
he
had
been
taken
away.
“Why
do
you
want
to
join
the
League?”
Lux
allowed
herself
a
smile,
trying
to
not
seem
smug.
While
anyone
who
had
been
subject
to
a
League
judgment
was
forbidden
to
discuss
the
trial,
Lux
had
done
her
research,
and
she
knew
that
they
summoned
illusions
to
extract
their
answers.
It
was
mere
child’s
play
for
her;
she
could
see
right
through
it,
and
she
knew
what
they
wanted
to
hear.
She
straightened
and
looked
the
illusion
of
her
brother
straight
in
the
eye.
“To
fight
for
justice
in
the
name
of
Demacia.”
“What
is
the
real
reason,
Luxanna?”
“Victory
for
our
allies,
defeat
for
our
enemies,
and
justice
for
all.”
They
were
both
quotes
from
The
Measured
Tread,
the
handbook
that
any
self-respecting
Demacian
could
recite
on
command,
but
they
did
not
make
them
any
less
true
for
her
own
purposes.
Her
brother
frowned,
and
that
was
the
last
thing
Lux
saw
before
an
explosion
of
light
consumed
them.
It
was
happening
again.
Sometimes,
the
light
would
bounce
off
the
glass
hall
of
the
Demacian
Royal
Academy,
casting
a
bewitching
display
of
prisms
in
every
direction.
Lux’s
skin
would
shimmer,
as
if
composed
from
the
dust
of
crystals.
Her
mood
lifted
and
she
let
the
light
envelop
her,
rendering
her
invisible
in
plain
sight.
She
hadn’t
yet
gained
control
over
the
odd
occurrence,
which
was
unfortunate
as
it
would
happen
at
random
intervals
during
the
most
inopportune
of
moments.
Lux
ran
off
in
the
direction
of
her
home,
heart
racing
in
the
hopes
that
the
illusion
would
stick
around
long
enough
for
her
to
show
her
parents.
There
was
only
a
fleeting
twinge
of
guilt
that
struck
her
for
leaving
school,
but
her
teacher
would
count
her
as
absent
anyway.
Lux
burst
into
the
Crownguard
residence.
To
her
delight,
she
heard
familiar
voices
speaking
quietly
in
the
kitchen.
She
found
three
military
officials
standing
at
attention,
speaking
to
her
parents.
Her
heart
skipped
a
beat
as
she
started
to
retreat
back
into
the
living
room;
they
were
discussing
important
business,
and
she
had
been
taught
better
than
to
interrupt.
She
would
have
left
the
house
entirely,
except
at
that
one
dreadful
moment,
she
heard
her
name.
She
froze.
“It
is
the
greatest
honor
you
could
bestow
upon
our
household
to
take
Luxanna.
She
will
serve
you
well,
just
as
Garen
has
before
her.”
A
chair
scraped
along
the
floor
as
her
mother
stood.
“You
are
sure,
Lilia?
Your
daughter
is
at
the
age
where
she
needs
her
parents
the
most,
especially
after
taking
her
older
brother
away.”
“It
is
all
in
the
King’s
name.
You
will
provide
all
the
parenting
that
she
will
need.”
Her
father’s
tone
was
dismissive.
“Very
well.
It
is
done.”
Lux
fell
to
the
ground,
the
repressed
memories
unforgivingly
rushing
back
into
her
mind.
Her
parents
delivering
the
news.
Lux
barricading
herself
in
her
room.
The
pain
in
her
arms
as
they
forcibly
dragged
her
away
from
her
home.
Her
hair
draped
across
her
face
as
she
refused
to
look
at
her
parents.
The
burn
of
her
tears
as
she
cried
herself
to
sleep
every
night.
The
booming
voices
yelling
at
her
to
focus.
Her
screams
as
she
cursed
her
family
for
doing
this
to
her.
Then,
her
own
voice
echoing
back
at
her,
reciting
the
Justice
Pledge
alongside
her
fellow
recruits.
The
comfort
of
re-reading
The
Measured
Tread
cover
to
cover
countless
times.
The
indoctrination
of
the
new
incoming
class,
led
by
Lux
herself.
The
pride
swelling
in
her
heart
as
she
marched
forth
under
Demacia’s
shining
banner.
The
accolades
in
praise
of
her
exemplary
work.
The
absolute
love
for
her
country.
The
emptiness
of
realization
of
what
she
had
willingly
grown
to
love.
The
assault
of
memories
subsided,
and
she
was
left
slumped
in
the
darkness.
She
knew
the
League
had
retreated
from
her
mind,
but
the
test
wasn’t
over
yet.
Someone
was
standing
before
her,
and
she
didn’t
even
have
to
look
up
to
know
who
it
was.
“Will
you
admit
the
real
reason
why
you
want
to
join
the
League
now?”
Her
labored
breaths
caught
in
her
throat
just
long
enough
for
her
to
whisper,
“Because
I
have
nothing
else…”
The
darkness
shattered
around
her,
falling
to
the
ground
in
shards.
She
crumpled
to
the
ground,
heaving
sobs
racking
her
body.
Garen
remained
standing,
his
normally
kind
face
gruff
and
unreadable
as
the
illusion
dissolved
around
them.
“You
have
just
shared
your
mind
with
me.
To
become
a
champion
of
the
League,
you
must
allow
others
into
your
mind,
and
they
will
know
your
true
conviction
and
purpose
better
than
you
yourself.
If
you
are
prepared,
you
know
what
you
must
do.”
Her
brother
turned
and
strode
through
the
hallway
that
stretched
before
them
to
another
set
of
double
doors.
He
did
not
stop
to
lend
her
a
hand,
nor
did
he
glance
backwards
to
see
if
she
would
follow.
He
didn’t
need
to.
Lux
remained
on
the
floor,
composing
herself.
For
a
moment,
she
considered
calling
out
to
her
brother
or
running
back
into
the
Great
Hallway,
out
of
the
League’s
penetrative
gaze.
This
was
the
first
challenge
that
ever
daunted
her,
even
moreso
than
when
she
was
being
tested
by
Demacia’s
top
magicians
or
sneaking
through
Noxus’s
innermost
tunnels.
But
she
was
a
Crownguard,
and
she
knew
that
she
would
overcome
this
challenge,
just
as
she
had
overcome
all
other
challenges
in
her
life.
She
stood,
clutching
the
baton
deftly
in
her
hand.
She
would
prove
that
her
dedication
to
her
city-state
was
true,
and
that
she
had
not
been
lying
when
she
first
answered
their
question.
