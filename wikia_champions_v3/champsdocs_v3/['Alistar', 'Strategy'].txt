Skill
usage
Using
Pulverize
can
allow
Alistar
to
establish
better
positioning
for
Headbutt
.
You
can
use
this
to
your
advantage
by
using
Pulverize
followed
by
Headbutt
to
push
them
into
your
turret's
firing
range.
Be
aware
that
skilled
players
will
know
this
gimmick
and
will
not
fall
for
it
unless
they
are
caught
unaware.
You
can
use
Flash
to
catch
your
target
off
guard,
followed
by
Pulverize
/
Headbutt
to
push
them
into
your
allies/turret.
Using
Pulverize
immediately
after
a
successful
Headbutt
will
apply
the
stun
from
Pulverize
.
Instead
of
being
pushed
back,
the
target
will
be
knocked
up
and
stay
in
place.
This
can
be
useful
in
some
chase
situations
(make
sure
you
succeed
or
you
will
knock
them
further
away),
or
finishing
off
a
weakened
opponent
on
the
run.
This
tactic
is
risky,
leaves
you
useless
while
both
abilities
are
on
cooldown
,
but
is
considered
a
staple
move
of
Alistar
and
used
very
often
in
both
competitive
and
casual
play.
In
the
event
that
a
tank
is
running
close
to
your
target
to
protect
them,
a
safer
and
often
more
useful
strategy
is
to
use
Headbutt
on
the
tank
to
get
you
into
range
to
Pulverize
your
true
target.
Be
wary
when
using
Headbutt
because
you
might
end
up
disrupting
positions
in
a
way
that
benefits
the
enemy
team,
particularly
knocking
them
out
of
a
teammate's
area
of
effect
.
Alistar
is
considered
a
great
roamer
due
to
the
fact
that
all
he
needs
is
his
Pulverize
and
Headbutt
combo
to
gank
a
lane.
Hitting
an
enemy
into
a
close-by
thick
wall
with
Headbutt
will
stun
them
for
~1s,
because
they
will
still
try
to
travel
the
distance,
though
the
wall
is
in
the
way.
Thus
they
will
be
stuck
against
the
wall
for
the
duration
of
the
flight.
However,
if
Headbutt
is
used
near
a
wall,
it
sometimes
sends
the
enemy
onto
the
other
side,
no
matter
how
thick,
allowing
them
to
escape.
This
can
also
be
used
to
your
advantage.
Sending
the
enemy
tank
or
a
high
damage
dealing
carry
(like
Fiddlesticks
after
he
uses
Crowstorm
)
over
a
wall
can
allow
your
team
to
win
a
5v4
match.
Most
walls
in
the
jungle
and
river
are
thin,
but
whether
they
will
go
over
them
or
not
depends
on
how
close
they
were
to
the
wall
at
impact.
If
they
are
a
high
priority
target,
it
may
be
better
to
keep
them
in
the
fight.
A
high
priority
threat
would
be
neutralized
if
knocked
over.
Unbreakable
Will
should
mostly
be
used
when
turret
diving
or
in
team
fights
when
you
are
being
focused.
When
using
Headbutt
you
are
always
guaranteed
an
auto
attack
with
it.
This
allows
your
Headbutt
to
proc
items
such
as
Sheen
.
Be
careful
when
using
a
Headbutt
/auto
attack
right
after
using
and
auto
attack,
for
the
auto
won't
be
guaranteed.
Build
Usage
Getting
Boots
of
Swiftness
will
allow
Alistar
to
position
himself
better
around
the
battlefield
for
Headbutt
.
Boots
of
Mobility
are
a
great
option
for
roaming,
something
Alistar
is
good
at
thanks
to
his
high
disruptive
power.
Try
to
buy
a
Sheen
to
increase
your
damage
and
pushing
capability.
Sheen
can
then
be
upgraded
to
Iceborn
Gauntlet
for
extra
disruption
and
survivability
in
teamfights
(in
addition
to
the
armour,
mana,
cooldown
reduction
and
collateral
splash
damage
all
help
with
letting
him
heal
more
often)
or
Trinity
Force
for
damage
and
mobility.
Getting
items
with
auras
like
Banner
of
Command
,
Sunfire
Cape
or
Abyssal
Scepter
help
your
entire
team
to
push
faster.
Especially
Sunfire
Cape's
auto-pushing
will
make
Triumphant
Roar
available
more
often
without
requiring
anyone
to
actually
target
minions
in
fights.
Talisman
of
Ascension
helps
Alistar
and
his
team
to
initiate.
It
also
helps
to
flee
or
to
get
in
range
to
stun
fleeing
opponents.
Thanks
to
Spirit
Visage
,
Alistar
can
heal
himself
for
additional
12/18/24/30/36
health
with
his
Triumphant
Roar
.
Amount
of
boost
is
rather
low,
but
it's
still
a
great
item
because
of
the
cooldown
reduction
and
survivability
it
provides.
Combined
with
Unbreakable
Will
's
tanking
potential,
Ohmwrecker
allows
Alistar's
team
to
dive
turrets
for
extended
periods
of
time.
Chalice
of
Harmony
is
a
viable
early
game
item
for
Alistar
during
the
laning
phase
as
his
abilities
cost
a
heavy
amount
of
mana
.
This
can
be
built
into
either
Athene's
Unholy
Grail
or
Mikael's
Crucible
,
depending
on
needs.
Athene's
Unholy
Grail
provides
CDR
and
AP
to
aid
in
your
personal
performance,
and
gives
Triumphant
Roar
more
power.
Mikael's
Crucible
is
useful
in
aiding
your
supporting
role
and
can
also
allow
you
a
second
chance
to
escape
if
you
are
CC'd
again
after
using
your
ultimate.

Countering
Stay
away
from
his
Pulverize
range
to
avoid
his
Pulverize
and
Headbutt
combo.
When
you
are
in
your
turret
range,
consider
staying
close
to
Alistar
so
that
if
he
uses
his
Triumphant
Roar
he
will
draw
turret
aggro
because
of
his
passive
damage
from
Trample
.
But
be
aware
that
would
make
you
an
easy
target
for
a
Pulverize
->
Headbutt
combo.
Flash
can
be
used
on
Alistar
to
quickly
get
into
the
middle
of
a
team,
hit
much
of
them
with
Pulverize
,
and
knock
a
squishy
target
toward
his
team
with
Headbutt
.
Always
spread
out
when
you
see
Alistar
walk
toward
your
team.
Beware
the
potential
combo
of
canceling
the
knockback
of
Headbutt
into
Pulverize
.
At
that
note,
it
is
safest
to
poke
Alistar
with
something
that
is
farther
than
the
650
ability
range
of
Headbutt
.
Alistar
is
a
pure
tank
that
naturally
has
a
high
health,
armor
and
magic
resistance.
Buying
items
such
as
Last
Whisper
or
Void
Staff
can
help
with
killing
him
faster.
It
is
best
to
wait
until
the
duration
of
his
Unbreakable
Will
wears
off
before
continuing
to
attack
him.
If
Alistar
has
already
cast
Pulverize
and
Headbutt
,
consider
ignoring
him
if
possible
for
the
cooldowns
of
those
two
abilities
are
very
significant
-
especially
since
spending
effort
to
attack
him
may
just
have
him
reduce
it
with
Unbreakable
Will
.
Due
to
said
significant
cooldowns,
crowd-controlling
his
own
team
as
he
uses
Pulverize
if
possible
can
waste
the
ability's
synergy
with
his
allies
and
leave
Alistar
with
little
else
to
do
for
his
team
while
it
cools
down
-
as
long
as
you
yourself
have
other
things
to
use
while
you
traded
cooldown(s)
of
your
own
for
his,
of
course.
Avoid
fighting
near
minion
waves
to
ensure
that
his
Triumphant
Roar
has
a
long
cooldown.
Position
yourself
in
such
a
way
that
it
is
difficult
for
Alistar
to
Headbutt
you
into
a
bad
position
that
may
endanger
yourself.
However,
be
wary
not
to
get
in
range
of
Pulverize
instead.
Try
to
position
yourself
properly
and
keep
distance
at
the
same
time.
Flash
or
other
movement
abilities
(such
as
Arcane
Shift
)
can
help
make
it
difficult
for
Alistar
to
land
a
combo
on
you,
or
make
for
an
easier
escape
after
he
already
has.
