Trivia
Lore
Sona
has
no
memories
of
her
true
parents.
As
an
infant,
she
was
found
abandoned
on
the
doorstep
of
an
Ionian
adoption
house,
nestled
atop
an
ancient
instrument
in
an
exquisite
case
of
unknown
origins.
She
was
an
unusually
well-behaved
child,
always
quiet
and
content.
Her
caretakers
were
sure
she
would
find
a
home
quickly,
but
it
soon
became
apparent
that
what
they
mistook
for
uncommon
geniality
was
actually
an
inability
to
speak
or
to
produce
any
sound
whatsoever.
Sona
remained
at
the
adoption
house
until
her
teens,
watching
in
hopeless
silence
as
prospective
adopters
passed
her
by.
During
this
time,
the
caretakers
sold
her
unusual
instrument
to
anxious
collectors,
hoping
to
build
her
a
trust.
For
a
myriad
of
bizarre
and
unexpected
reasons,
however,
it
would
be
returned,
or
simply
appear
again
outside
the
house.
When
a
wealthy
Demacian
woman
named
Lestara
Buvelle
learned
of
the
instrument,
she
immediately
embarked
to
Ionia
.
When
the
caretakers
showcased
the
instrument
for
her,
she
rose
wordlessly
and
explored
the
house,
stopping
outside
Sona’s
room.
Without
hesitation,
Lestara
adopted
her
and
left
a
generous
donation
for
the
instrument.
With
Lestara’s
guidance,
Sona
discovered
a
deep
connection
with
the
instrument
which
Lestara
called
an
"etwahl".
In
her
hands,
it
played
tones
which
stilled
or
quivered
the
hearts
of
those
around
her.
Within
months,
she
was
headlining
with
the
mysterious
etwahl
for
sold-out
audiences.
She
played
as
though
plucking
heartstrings,
effortlessly
manipulating
the
emotions
of
her
listeners
-
all
without
a
single
written
note.
In
secret,
she
discovered
a
potent
and
deadly
use
for
her
etwahl,
using
its
vibrations
to
slice
objects
from
a
distance.
She
honed
this
discipline
in
private,
mastering
her
gift.
When
she
felt
prepared,
she
went
to
the
only
place
which
could
offer
her
a
fitting
recital:
the
League
of
Legends
.
"Her
melody
moves
the
soul,
her
silence
sunders
the
body."
―
Jericho
Swain
,
after
attending
her
concert
Quotes
Because
Sona
cannot
speak,
these
responses
are
understood
to
be
magical
telepathy
with
her
summoner.
This
is
seen
in
the
fact
that
her
external
interactions
(taunt,
joke)
are
musical
cues
rather
than
words,
meaning
that,
as
stated,
only
her
summoner
can
hear
her
words.

CLE
OBSERVATION
Sona
glides
forward
on
harmonious
winds,
her
elegant
robe
billowing
softly
behind
her
as
she
enters
the
Great
Hall.
Her
hair
fans
out
on
an
invisible
breeze,
swaths
of
aqua
dissolving
into
golden
strands
at
the
ends
of
her
long
ponytails.
She
could
easily
be
a
fair
maiden
of
magic
anywhere
on
Runeterra,
if
not
for
the
strange
instrument
floating
before
her,
appearing
to
simultaneously
protect
and
guide
her.
The
building
creaks
ever
so
slightly,
the
foundations
resettling
themselves
on
the
bonds
of
strong
magic.
She
angles
her
ear
towards
the
sound,
holding
still
for
a
moment
after
the
sound
has
long
since
faded.
One
can
tell
that
the
sound
still
resonates
in
her
head,
being
analyzed
for
tonality,
intent,
and
above
all,
danger.
She
doesn’t
even
bother
to
glance
at
her
surroundings;
the
building’s
own
internal
symphony
tells
her
all
that
she
needs
to
know
about
this
place.
With
the
faintest
movement,
she
expertly
plucks
a
single
string
on
her
instrument
and
the
double
doors
in
front
of
her
blast
open.
She
enters
without
hesitation.
REFLECTION
The
darkness
unfurled
around
her,
as
deep
as
the
endless
chasm
of
silence
that
afflicted
her.
She
felt
no
fear
so
long
as
the
etwahl
was
in
her
grasp.
Her
arms
curled
lovingly
around
the
instrument,
her
fingers
expertly
trailing
along
the
hammered
brass
and
taut
strings.
Pressing
it
against
her
cheek,
she
closed
her
eyes
and
waited.
It
was
at
times
like
this
that
she
could
feel
the
instrument
alive
in
her
arms,
taking
slow
and
measured
breaths
as
it
guarded
its
master.
She
treasured
these
moments,
when
she
could
be
alone
in
the
world
with
her
beloved
instrument,
wrapped
in
its
protective
cocoon.
Suddenly,
the
etwahl
stiffened.
She
caressed
the
smooth
curve
of
metal
questioningly.
Before
she
could
cull
an
answer,
a
husky
voice
rang
out.
“Sona!”
Sona’s
eyes
flew
open
at
the
only
sound
she
loved
more
than
music
itself.
She
found
herself
at
the
doorstep
of
a
Demacian
estate,
staring
into
the
open
doorway
with
the
same
wonder
on
her
face
as
on
the
day
she
was
brought
to
her
new
home.
Lestara
Buvelle
stood
before
her,
adorned
in
a
handsome
velvet
robe.
Dripping
in
jewels
and
her
usual
heavy
perfume,
Lestara
moved
forward,
her
round
face
bright
with
happiness.
“My
darling,
look
at
you!
You
are
a
grown
woman
now,
and
you
have
made
much
of
yourself.”
Lestara
embraced
Sona
and
leaned
back
to
appraise
her.
“Truly,
you
have
made
me
proud.
My
heart
sings
when
I
look
upon
you.
Come
in
and
sit
with
me
awhile.”
Lestara
turned
to
walk
down
the
long
hallway,
her
footsteps
clicking
a
staccato
rhythm
on
the
tile
floor.
Sona’s
heart
swelled
with
happiness,
and
she
reached
for
her
instrument’s
reassuring
steel.
Her
hands
clutched
nothing
but
air.
Sona
turned,
looking
for
the
etwahl.
Had
she
mindlessly
placed
it
aside
just
now?
Suddenly,
a
chord
rang
out,
piercingly
askew.
Sona
spun
around
to
see
the
etwahl
drifting
swiftly
down
the
hallway.
Sona
called
the
instrument
back
to
her,
but
for
the
first
time,
it
paid
no
heed.
The
single
note
played
over
and
over
as
it
drew
closer
to
Lestara’s
back.
It
was
out
for
blood.
Sona
flew
frantically
into
the
hallway,
but
she
was
too
far
away
to
reach
Lestara
in
time.
Her
only
chance
was
to
scream
a
warning.
She
strained
her
throat,
but
no
sound
would
come
forth,
just
as
it
never
had
in
her
entire
life.
The
etwahl’s
strings
strummed
a
terrible
noise
that
would
forever
be
embedded
in
her
memory.
A
vibration
trembled
through
the
air,
and
a
rush
of
razor-thin
air
scythes
tore
through
Lestara’s
body.
Sona
reached
Lestara’s
side
in
time
to
catch
her
as
the
body
fell
to
the
ground
in
a
pool
of
blood.
Tears
streamed
down
Sona’s
face
as
she
tried
to
scream,
but
no
sound
would
come
out.
The
hallway
dissolved
into
blackness,
leaving
Sona
crumpled
around
Lestara’s
body,
with
the
etwahl
lying
innocently
at
her
side.
Lestara’s
eyes
rolled
open,
and
she
asked
weakly,
“Why
do
you
want
to
join
the
League?”
Sona’s
mind
reeled,
unable
to
comprehend
what
was
happening.
Suddenly,
she
felt
the
tingle
of
arcane
magic
in
her
throat,
an
overwhelming
sensation
that
brought
tears
to
her
eyes.
The
breath
passing
in
and
out
of
her
body
tickled
inside
her,
trying
to
draw
sounds
out
with
every
exhale.
Sona
stared
incredulously
at
Lestara,
who
nodded
at
her
and
bade
her
to
speak.
Opening
her
mouth,
she
began
to
speak
for
the
first
time
in
her
life.
Her
breath
caught
in
her
throat,
short
of
uttering
her
first
sound,
when
a
booming
voice
from
the
recesses
of
her
dim
memory
resounded
in
her
mind.
This
instrument
will
be
the
key
to
unlocking
the
world.
It
will
speak
for
you
more
truly
than
a
voice
ever
could.
Nothing
else
–
not
us,
them,
or
any
magic
in
this
world
will
ever
own
you
again.
Almost
of
its
own
accord,
her
hand
flung
outwards
and
slammed
down
on
the
ethwahl
next
to
her.
Dissonance
erupted,
deafeningly
loud,
drowning
out
any
sounds
that
might
have
spilled
forth
from
her
lips.
As
the
tones
faded
away,
so
did
the
foreign
tingling
in
her
throat.
The
enchantment
was
gone,
never
to
return.
Lestara’s
voice
grew
loud,
booming
into
the
ether.
“Why
do
you
want
to
join
the
League,
Sona?”
The
ethwahl’s
strings
shivered
and
began
to
play
on
its
own,
but
Sona
pressed
down
with
her
palm
to
silence
the
instrument.
It
resisted
for
a
tense
moment
and
fell
quiet.
Slowly,
her
fingers
began
to
trickle
across
the
strings.
Hesitantly
at
first,
testing
her
instrument’s
yield,
she
played
a
defiant
progression
in
response
to
her
question.
“How
does
it
feel,
exposing
your
mind?”
Her
fingers
danced
across
the
strings,
urging
forth
a
melody
of
loneliness
and
isolation.
It
was
the
song
of
those
who
had
lived
their
lives
hidden
in
plain
sight,
always
passed
over
despite
trying
desperately
to
be
noticed.
It
began
pensively,
mournfully
sad,
and
gradually
grew
to
a
crashing,
raging
crescendo.
The
last
notes
echoed
with
a
tone
of
quiet
acceptance,
but
above
all,
catharsis.
A
smile
raked
across
Lestara’s
face.
“Welcome
to
the
League,
Maven
of
the
Strings.”
Lestara
disappeared,
and
the
darkness
fell
away
to
reveal
Sona
floating
in
front
of
ornate
double
doors.
She
knew
they
led
to
the
League
of
Legends.
Her
ethwahl
molded
reassuringly
to
her
hands,
lying
in
wait
for
its
master’s
command.
Sona
moved
through
the
doors
without
a
second
glance.
