Trivia
Xerath
was
designed
by
Volty
with
RiotRunaan
and
Ironstylus
providing
his
original
creative
concept
and
art,
respectively.
Xerath
is
voiced
by
Michael
McConnohie
.
Xerath
is
currently
the
only
entity
presented
as
(nearly)
omnipotent
in
the
League
of
Legends
universe,
and
currently
the
most
powerful.
Syndra
has
been
speculated
to
be
or
have
the
potential
to
become
godlike,
much
like
Xerath.
However
much
like
Syndra,
he
is
severely
limited
at
the
moment
There
is
currently
quite
a
debate
in
the
community
about
which
champion
would
finally
be
more
powerful,
but
it
seems
to
lean
on
Xerath's
side.
The
argument
that
he
doesn't
have
a
body
limiting
him
seems
to
give
him
an
edge
over
Syndra.
Xerath
was
indirectly
referenced
in
the
Journal
of
Justice
prior
to
his
release.
When
Xerath
dies
his
body
quickly
becomes
unstable
and
overly
shiny,
just
to
blow
up
a
moment
later,
much
like
a
nuclear-powered
machine.
The
icon
for
Xerath's
ability,
Arcanopulse
is
slightly
similar
to
that
of
the
mastery
Blast
Xerath's
dance
is
known
as
"industrial
dancing",
which
is
evident
in
the
song
Pong
by
Eisenfunk
.
A
comparison
can
be
seen
here
.
Xerath
himself
can
be
seen
when
he
performs
his
taunt.
As
he
disarms
the
parts
of
his
sarcophagus,
a
person
made
of
pure
energy
or
electricity
can
be
briefly
seen.
When
he
dies
this
"person"
disappears,
what
remains
on
the
ground
are
the
shattered
remains
of
his
sarcophagus.
It's
likely
that
that
form
was
his
actual
look
before
he
got
locked
away.
There's
an
interesting
mechanic
that
can
be
seen
with
his
Classic,
Battlecast,
and
Runeborn
skins.
When
an
enemy
is
hit
with
Arcanopulse
,
they
leave
behind
a
purple
ball,
revealing
them.
The
Scorched
Earth
skin
does
not
seem
to
have
this.
Xerath
seems
to
be
cocky
about
his
position
as
an
ascendent
being,
reminding
the
summoners
that
he
is
ageless
and
all-mighty
and
seems
to
despise
normal
creatures,
considering
them
fragile
and
weak.
Some
speculate
that
Xerath
is
ambidextrous
as
he
uses
both
left
and
right
hands
for
different
attacks
and
abilities,
unlike
most
champions
who
almost
always
use
the
right
one.
From
the
lore,
many
people
believed
that
Xerath
was
going
to
be
Alowicious
Chucat
,
a
master
artificer
who
died
working
on
the
Innervating
Locket
.
This
was
disproved
with
the
release
of
Xerath's
backstory.
Xerath
is,
along
with
Caitlyn
,
Lissandra
,
Rumble
,
Varus
,
Vi
,
and
Ziggs
,
one
of
the
few
champions
that
can
CC
themselves.
Xerath's
appearance
may
be
a
reference
to
Starcraft's
'
Archons
,
which
are
also
beings
of
pure
energy.
Xerath
may
have
some
relation
to
Dr.
Xavier
Rath.
Quotes
Xerath's
jokes
are
a
reference
to
the
Power
Thirst
and
the
LARPing
Lightning
Bolt!
videos.
He
has
a
exclusive
joke
for
the
Brazilian
server,
inspired
by
a
Windy
of
Tenebra
(a
Tibia
player)
conversation
in
TeamSpeak.
A
comparison
can
be
seen
here.
Skins
In
Xerath's
champion
spotlight,
Battlecast
Xerath
was
called
"Lockdown
Xerath"
and
Runeborn
Xerath
was
called
"Runeforge
Xerath".
Due
to
the
community's
popular
demand,
both
of
Xerath's
skins
were
reworked.
They
both
received
new
particle
effects
and
colors
due
to
them
being
too
similar
to
the
Classic
skin
before
the
rework.
Battlecast
Xerath
has
red
particles
and
Runeborn
Xerath
has
green
particles.
Scorched
Earth
Xerath
might
be
a
reference
to
the
military
doctrine
of
Scorched
Earth
,
in
which
anything
deemed
useful
to
the
enemy
is
destroyed.
Scorched
Earth
Xerath's
appearance
and
armor
bears
a
similarity
to
Pyroviles,
a
volcanic
alien
species
featuring
in
the
fourth
series
of
Doctor
Who
-
"The
Fires
of
Pompeii"
episode.
The
Skin's
splash
art
features
a
volcano
in
the
background
that
shares
a
resemblance
to
Vesuvius.
If
Mordekaiser's
ultimate,
Children
of
the
Grave
,
is
on
Xerath
when
he
dies,
the
neon
coloration
of
the
skin
will
still
be
on
the
ghost.
Classic
skin
will
be
blue,
Battlecast
will
be
red,
Runeborn
will
be
green,
and
Scorched
Earth
will
have
a
lava
texture,
this
is
entirely
unique
for
Xerath
as
all
other
champions
lose
all
color
and
become
grey
and
transparent
while
they
are
ghosts.
The
reason
for
this
is
because
his
body
is
a
visual
effect
and
not
an
actual
model.
Relationships
According
to
the
League
of
Legends
beta
site
,
Xerath
is
Cassiopeia
and
Renekton's
friend.
They
all
also
live
on
Shurima
(
Cassiopeia
also
lives
in
Noxus
)
Acording
to
Ryze
,
Xerath
is
an
"Abomination
of
a
mage"
and
that
his
hold
over
the
magical
powers
he
wields
is
"feeble".
In
Xerath's
League
Judgement
it
was
revealed
that
he
had
a
friend
called
Tabia.
The
two
of
them
seemed
to
have
romantic
feelings
for
each
other.
Tabia
tried
to
interrupt
Xerath's
transformation,
out
of
fear
he'd
die
but
she
ended
up
dying
herself.
