Fueled
by
his
unbridled
fury
and
rage,
Tryndamere
cuts
his
way
through
the
tundra,
mastering
the
art
of
battle
by
challenging
the
Freljord's
greatest
warriors.
The
wrathful
barbarian
seeks
revenge
on
the
one
who
decimated
his
clan
and
strikes
down
all
those
who
stand
between
him
and
his
final
retribution.
Struggling
to
survive
in
the
harsh,
frostbitten
Freljord
,
the
young
Tryndamere
and
his
people
warred
with
other
tribes
over
the
scarce
resources
of
the
land.
One
such
battle
changed
his
life
forever.
Raiders
ambushed
Tryndamere's
clan
in
the
dead
of
night,
and
though
his
warriors
were
able
to
push
the
first
wave
of
attackers
back,
they
weren't
prepared
for
the
dark
figure
that
next
stepped
forth.
He
wielded
a
cruel,
living
sword,
and
inspired
an
unhinged
bloodlust
in
the
invaders
with
his
unearthly
magic.
Tryndamere's
tribe
was
overrun
within
moments.
With
no
hope
of
defeating
the
enigmatic
being,
Tryndamere
threw
himself
at
certain
death.
The
dark
figure
swatted
him
aside,
mortally
wounding
the
young
barbarian.
Tryndamere
saw
death
and
destruction
engulf
his
home
as
his
life
slipped
away.
No
one
was
left
standing
-
only
the
screams
of
the
dying
remained.
Unable
to
surrender
to
death,
Tryndamere
gave
in
fully
to
his
wrath.
His
blood
boiled
and
his
anger
consumed
him,
banishing
his
mortality.
He
staggered
to
his
feet
-
barely
able
to
take
hold
of
his
sword
-
steeling
himself
for
the
decisive
confrontation
with
the
shadowy
being.
But
the
dark
figure
did
not
even
lift
his
blade,
and
instead
gave
Tryndamere
a
knowing
smile
as
he
withdrew
into
the
shadows.
That
was
the
last
time
the
barbarian
ever
saw
his
nemesis.
A
man
robbed
of
his
home
and
his
people,
Tryndamere
wandered
across
the
Freljord
for
years,
vowing
to
forge
himself
into
a
brutal
instrument
of
revenge.
He
visited
all
the
tribes
in
the
frozen
wastes,
besting
each
of
their
warriors
until
there
were
none
left
to
challenge.
In
doing
so,
he
mastered
the
barbarian
ways
of
war
and
harnessed
his
anger
as
a
force
to
be
reckoned
with.
With
sword
in
hand
and
rage
in
his
heart,
he
is
now
on
an
undying
quest
for
vengeance
against
the
one
who
destroyed
the
life
he
once
knew.
"Rage
is
my
weapon."
―
Tryndamere
There
are
those
who
choose
not
to
live
in
one
of
the
great
city-states
of
Valoran
.
Instead,
they
live
in
remote
locales,
often
as
part
of
a
nomad
or
barbarian
tribe.
While
perils
abound
in
these
untamed
lands,
there
is
also
great
freedom
in
being
removed
from
the
politics
of
Valoran.
Tryndamere
was
born
a
member
of
one
of
these
barbarian
tribes
in
northern
Valoran.
Even
as
a
young
boy,
it
was
obvious
that
he
would
grow
in
martial
prowess
to
become
one
of
his
clan's
greatest
warriors.
However,
as
his
clan
moved
south
between
the
Howling
Marsh
and
the
Ironspike
Mountains,
they
came
across
strangers
in
black
garb,
brandishing
symbols
of
a
beast's
skull.
Despite
Tryndamere's
pleas,
his
elder
went
out
to
speak
with
the
strangers;
they
cut
him
down
mercilessly.
From
there,
they
began
to
slaughter
every
man,
woman,
and
child
in
the
clan.
Tryndamere,
the
sole
survivor,
hid
under
the
bodies
of
his
dead
parents.
Upon
their
bloodied
corpses,
he
swore
eternal
vengeance
on
those
who
took
his
people
from
him
-
the
assassins
of
Noxus
.
To
train
himself,
Tryndamere
voluntarily
served
under
all
the
great
chieftains
of
the
barbarian
tribes,
learning
the
ways
of
the
barbarian
warrior.
Not
only
did
this
make
him
the
man
he
needed
to
become
in
order
to
exact
his
revenge,
it
has
also
garnered
him
friends
and
allies
among
the
most
powerful
barbarian
leaders
of
Valoran.
This
recently
allowed
him
to
unite
the
barbarians
into
a
single,
powerful
force
-
all
under
his
command.
Now
he
has
joined
the
League
of
Legends
to
earn
enough
influence
to
find
a
permanent
home
for
his
people...
and
to
slake
his
rage
on
the
champions
of
his
hated
foes.
"The
next
true
power
will
come
from
the
far
north,
and
it
will
involve
Tryndamere
-
one
way
or
another."

There
are
those
who
choose
not
to
live
in
one
of
the
great
city-states
of
Valoran
.
Instead,
they
live
their
lives
in
small
villages
or
nomadic
tribes.
There
are
most
certainly
perils
in
these
untamed
lands,
but
there
are
also
great
freedoms
that
come
from
being
removed
from
the
politics
of
Runeterra
.
Tryndamere
was
born
a
member
of
one
of
these
nomadic
tribes,
a
large
child
of
surprising
strength.
One
year,
as
his
clan
moved
south
between
the
Howling
Marsh
and
the
Ironspike
Mountains,
they
came
across
strangers
in
black
garb.
The
elder
went
out
to
speak
with
them,
but
they
cut
him
down
mercilessly.
They
then
began
the
slaughter
of
every
man,
woman,
and
child
in
the
clan.
Tryndamere,
the
sole
survivor,
hid
under
the
dead
bodies
of
his
parents,
swearing
vengeance
on
those
who
took
his
people
from
him
-
the
assassins
of
Noxus
.
He
has
since
joined
the
League
of
Legends
to
bring
honor
to
the
memory
of
his
people
and
to
slake
his
rage
on
the
champions
of
his
hated
foes.
"Beware
of
Tryndamere!
His
sword
appeases
the
hunger
of
the
soul-devouring
dead."
There
was
a
legend
among
the
barbarians
clans
of
the
Fyrone
Flats,
told
each
time
one
of
their
own
was
to
give
birth.
It
was
a
story
about
a
child
who
would
enter
the
world
with
a
distinctive
mark
on
his
belly-a
black
circular
rune,
resembling
a
snake,
coiled
over
on
itself,
biting
at
its
tail.
It
was
said
that
when
this
child
was
born,
it
would
signal
the
beginning
of
a
new
era.
It
was
said
that
the
barbarian
tribes
would
rise
up,
and
under
the
banner
of
a
serpent-shaped
rune,
they
would
rule
the
world.
When
that
child
was
born,
the
barbarian
nations
rejoiced.
They
feasted
and
drank
and
danced.
And
when
they
finished,
they
donned
their
skins,
lifted
their
swords,
and
they
flooded
out
of
the
flats
to
begin
an
onslaught
that
once
again
plunged
the
world
into
war.
The
child,
named
Tryndamere,
became
a
formidable
warrior.
And
now,
here
at
the
Institute
of
War,
he
is
prepared
to
unleash
his
barbaric
strength
and
take
his
place
atop
the
world.</p>

There's
something
lurking
in
the
trees
of
Summoner's
Rift.
Something
so
vile,
so
menacing,
and
so
terrifying
that
even
the
bravest
of
champions
dare
not
set
foot
in
the
jungle.
It's
been
said
that
wolves,
golems,
and
dragons
have
been
going
missing,
and
that
even
the
dreaded
Baron
Nashor
fears
for
his
life.
While
no
one
is
sure
exactly
who
or
what
is
responsible
for
the
disappearances,
a
strange
figure
has
been
spotted
moving
ever
so
methodically
through

of
him
