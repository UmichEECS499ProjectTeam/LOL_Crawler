Trivia
Warwick
was
designed
by
Ezreal
.
Warwick
is
voiced
by
Brian
Sommer,
who
also
voices
Tryndamere
and
Willump
.
Warwick's
concept
is
greatly
inspired
from
the
folklore
surrounding
werewolves
,
humans
who
have
the
ability
to
shapeshift
into
a
wolf-like
creatures
after
being
cursed.
The
ability
thumbnails
for
Eternal
Thirst
,
Infinite
Duress
and
Blood
Scent
show
Warwick
in
his
Grey
skin
instead
of
his
Classic
skin.
Warwick's
Blood
Scent
ability
is
similar
to
Bloodseeker's
Thirst
ability
from
DotA
.
Warwick's
dance
is
from
Michael
Jackson's
music
video
Thriller
.
On
the
Headless
Hecarim
skin,
Warwick's
and
Rengar's
skulls
are
hanging
on
his
belt.
The
"Valoran
Geographic"
is
a
reference
to
the
National
Geographic
magazine.
In
Champion
Select,
if
you
search
for
"Urf",
Warwick's
image
comes
up.
Quotes
Warwick's
joke
"All
the
better
to
eat
you
with
my
dear!"
is
a
reference
to
the
fable
Little
Red
Riding
Hood
.
Skins
Urf
the
Manatee
Warwick
is
reference
to
the
April
Fool's
day
hero
Urf
.
At
the
end
of
April
Fool's
Day
2010
it
was
known
that
Warwick
had
killed
and
flayed
Urf.
The
skin
itself
cost
5000
and
was
reduced
by
99%
for
most
of
the
available
time
to
50
,
until
it
shifted
to
500
.
On
the
last
weekend,
it
cost
the
actual
price
before
turning
unique.
Riot
Games
donated
the
money
to
a
foundation
protecting
hunted
manatees.
On
the
Harrowing
version
of
Summoner's
Rift
,
if
Urf's
ghost
is
approached
by
Warwick
wearing
the
Urf
skin,
Urf
would
throw
his
spatula
at
Warwick
and
shake
his
head.
In
the
Urf
the
Manatee
Warwick
skin
a
sand
sculpture
of
a
turret
can
be
seen
Big
Bad
Warwick
is
a
reference
to
the
Big
Bad
Wolf
from
the
story
Little
Red
Riding
Hood
,
where
the
wolf
disguises
himself
as
the
girl's
grandmother.
Firefang
Warwick
is
a
possible
reference
to
the
mythical
creature
Ifrit
,
which
is
said
to
be
a
fire
demon
that
takes
the
shape
of
a
giant
wolf-like
creature.
Hyena
Warwick
has
a
special
running
animation
and
a
different
laugh.
In
the
Taiwanese
client,
Hyena
Warwick
skin
is
labelled
"Lv11",
referencing
the
bounty
quest
target
Hogger
from
World
of
Warcraft
,
the
very
first
elite
mob
that
most
alliance
players
would
come
across
and
have
trouble
with.
Grey
Warwick
can
only
be
obtained
after
getting
25
referrals.
Tundra
Hunter
Warwick
is
a
possible
reference
to
Sabrewulf
from
Killer
Instince
Relations
In
an
effort
to
complete
a
special
potion
made
by
Singed
to
help
Warwick
increase
his
capacity
to
hunt
down
specimens,
he
tried
to
kill
Soraka
to
obtain
her
heart
for
the
potion.
Before
his
lycanthropy,
Warwick
was
a
long
time
friend
of
the
alchemist
Singed
,
finding
him
many
human
specimens
to
experiment
with.
It
was
Warwick
who
killed
Urf,
the
Manatee
.
He
occasionally
wears
Urf's
skin
on
the
Fields
of
Justice
.
