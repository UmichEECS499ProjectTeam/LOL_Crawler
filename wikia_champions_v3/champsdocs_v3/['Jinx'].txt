is
a
toggled
ability
that
grants
Jinx
an
on-hit
effect
that
varies
depending
on
her
current
equipped
weapon.
Does
not
apply
spell
effects
.
Spell
shields
will
have
no
effect.
Additional
Information:
While
the
main
target
of
Fishbones
will
not
be
affected
by
spell
effects
such
as
Rylai's
or
spellvamp,
targets
hit
by
the
splash
portion
will
be
affected
as
if
the
damage
were
an
area
of
effect
spell.
While
Jinx
is
visually
using
Pow-Pow
from
the
start
of
the
game,
she
does
not
benefit
from
the
bonus
attack
speed
until
Switcheroo!
has
been
leveled.
Aside
from
your
first
basic
attack,
your
basic
attacks
while
Fishbones
is
active
will
not

It
is

Jinx
has
the
4th

in
the
game,
with
only
0.

.
While
having
the
full
3
cumulative
stacks
of
bonus
attack
speed
from
Pow-Pow
puts
her
at
the
fastest
attack
speed
while
not
utilizing
an
active
ability,
her
attacks
are
considerably
slower
than
other
champions
while

.

static

range
with
rank

Fishbones
;
out-ranged
only

Tristana
by
3
units.
Including
bonus
attack
range
from
activated
abilities,
Jinx
is
out-ranged
only
by
Tristana
at
level
18,
Kog'Maw
with
rank-5
Bio-Arcane
Barrage
activated,
and
Twitch
with
Spray
and
Pray
activated.
On-hit
effects
are
only
applied
to
the
primary
target,
and
not
to
any
targets
hit
by
splash
damage.
The
10%
bonus
damage
dealt
to
Jinx's
primary
from
Fishbones
will
apply
life
steal
.
The
splash
damage
will
not
occur
if
Jinx's
attack
is
blocked
,
dodged
,
parried
,
or
if
the
attack
misses
.
The
splash
damage
will
still
occur
while
attacking
towers
and
will
draw
aggro.
The
on-hit
splash
damage
effect
from
Fishbones
will
be
triggered
with
each
bolt
from
Runaan's
Hurricane
.
The
splash
around
secondary
targets
will
deal
10
+
50%
AD
.
Any
targets
in
the
splash
range
can
also
be
damaged
by
the
splash
damage
from
the
other
targets
and
splash
damage
areas
will
stack
if
they
overlap,
allowing
for
a
maximum
damage
of
20
+
210%
AD
to
the
targets
or
tertiary
enemies
standing
in
all
three
areas
of
splash
damage
(not
factoring
critical
strikes
or
damage
modifiers).
Spell
Weaving
and
Blade
Weaving
appear
to
interact
inconsistently
with
Fishbones
and
Runaan's
Hurricane
;
all
of
the
projectiles
will
trigger
Spell
Weaving
when
they
hit
a
Champion,
but
the
splash
damage
and
extra
projectiles
will
not
trigger
Blade
Weaving
,
the
splash
only
triggering
Blade
Weaving
if
damaging
another
champion.
Note
that
the
secondary
targets
of
Runaan's
Hurricane
can
be
up
to
375
units
away,
meaning
it
is
not
guaranteed
that
the
splash
damage
areas
will
overlap.
However,
Runaan's
prioritizes
the
closest
enemies
to
your
target
-
making
it
relatively
easy
to
overlap
at
least
two
areas
of
damage.
Fishbones
consumes
mana
per
attack,
not
per
target
hit.
As
such,
Runaan's
Hurricane
will
not
drain
any
additional
mana
for
the
additional
bolts
it
fires.
While
using
Muramana
,
Fishbones'
mana
cost
is
deducted
before
Muramana's
damage
is
calculated.

will
travel
in
a

across
the

until
it

increasing

(1500

of
the
possible
total
(both
base
damage

damage).
The
damage
based
on

is
calculated
on
an

basis
for
each

hit,
and
not
based
off
the

Note:
blocking
the

Additional
Information:
The
rocket
will
not
collide
with
any
non-champion
targets,
however
all
non-friendly,
non-structure
