Lore
There
is
a
place
between
dimensions,
between
worlds.
To
some
it
is
known
as
the
Outside,
to
others
it
is
the
Unknown.
To
those
that
truly
know,
however,
it
is
called
the
Void
.
Despite
its
name,
the
Void
is
not
an
empty
place,
but
rather
the
home
of
unspeakable
things
-
horrors
not
meant
for
minds
of
men.
Cho'Gath
is
a
creature
born
of
the
Void,
a
thing
whose
true
nature
is
so
awful
most
will
not
speak
its
name.
Its
fellows
have
been
poking
at
the
walls
that
divide
dimensions
for
a
crack,
a
way
into
Runeterra
,
where
they
can
visit
their
own
personal
paradise
of
horror
upon
the
world.
They
are
called
the
Voidborn,
creatures
so
ancient
and
terrible
that
they
have
been
removed
from
history
altogether.
It
is
rumored
that
the
Voidborn
command
vast
armies
of
unspeakable
creatures
on
other
worlds,
that
they
were
once
driven
from
Runeterra
by
powerful
magic
lost
to
antiquity.
If
such
tales
are
true,
then
the
rumors
that
follow
must
be
equally
true
-
that
one
day,
the
Voidborn
will
return.
Even
now,
something
dark
stirs
in
Icathia
,
perverting
the
summoning
rituals
of
the
League
to
allow
the
presence
of
Cho'Gath.
It
is
an
alien
creature
of
malice
and
violence,
a
thing
that
causes
all
but
the
most
stalwart
to
cringe
in
fear.
Cho'Gath
even
appears
to
feed
on
its
predations,
growing
and
swelling
as
it
gorges
itself.
Worse
yet,
the
creature
is
intelligent,
perhaps
greatly
so,
making
most
wonder
how
such
a
monster
could
be
contained.
Fortunately,
the
power
of
the
League's
summoning
has
confined
Cho'Gath's
presence
exclusively
to
the
League
of
Legends.
It
is
here
that
summoners
use
Cho'Gath's
Voidborn
abilities
to
help
decide
the
fate
of
Runeterra.
The
Terror
of
the
Void
knows
what
fate
it
would
choose
for
Runeterra,
given
half
the
chance.
"
Woe
betides
the
day
when
Cho'Gath
grows
weary
of
the
League.

In
another
world
where
flesh
is
replaced
by
techmaturgy,
Battlecast
Prime
Cho’Gath
is
the
most
feared
and
deadly
construct
to
crush
his
way
across
the
battlefield.
This
new
version
of
the
Terror
of
the
Void
comes
to
the
fight
as
a
mechanical
menace,
firing
missile
salvos
instead
of
Vorpal
Spikes,
bellowing
a
distorted
version
of
Feral
Scream
from
powerful
speakers
and
launching
subterranean
missiles
that
Rupture
underneath
your
foes.
With
a
mechanized
model
and
brand
new
effects,
sounds,
and
animations
including
a
new
recall,
you’ll
be
ready
to
claim
the
future
for
the
truly
evolved.
