Trivia
Urgot
was
designed
by
both
Geeves
and
Issfire
.
Urgot
champion
concept
is
speculated
to
be
the
evolution
of
Priscilla,
the
Spider
Queen
,
a
champion
that
was
never
released
but
found
in
the
game
files.
The
word
"Urgot"
is
similar
to
"ergot",
a
type
of
fungus
that
grows
on
grain.
Urgot
resembles
the
Strogg
leader
Makron
from
the
Quake
video
game
series.
He
also
strongly
resembles
"The
spinless
ones"
from
the
X-men,
the
best-known
of
them
being
Mojo
.
They
are
an
alien
race
of
fat
aliens
who
can
not
move
on
their
own
without
advanced
technology,
and
look
rotten.
Urgot
was
the
first
champion
revealed
in
The
Journal
of
Justice
before
being
officially
announced,
not
counting
the
token
mention
of
Sejuani
.
Urgot's
auto-attack
range
of
425
is
the
shortest
of
all
champions
classified
as
ranged.
According
to
Babaganoosh,
Urgot
was
unavailable
for
the
Ionia
versus
Noxus
Grudge
Match
due
to
being
damaged
and
needing
considerable
time
to
be
repaired.
He
received
a
major
strength
buff
in
the
following
patch
release.
Professor
Stanwick
Pididly's
quote
at
the
end
of
Urgot's
background
info
is
a
reference
to
the
"
The
Six
Million
Dollar
Man
".
Urgot's
dance
is
a
reference
to
Kirby's
Victory
Dance.

Quotes
Urgot's
taunt
"Fear?
No...
I
am
the
mindkiller."
is
a
reference
to
Frank
Herbert's
Dune
in
which
the
Bene
Gesserit
Litany
Against
Fear
begins
with
"I
must
not
fear;
fear
is
the
mindkiller
..."
Urgot's
joke
"You
can't
beat
me,
so
join
me.
I
need
a
good
pair
of
legs."
is
a
pun
on
the
popular
saying
"If
you
can't
beat
them,
join
them"
with
Urgot
referring
to
the
literal
merging
of
flesh
and
bone.
Skins
Urgot's
Butcher
skin
is
a
reference
to
Leatherface
from
the
"
The
Texas
Chainsaw
Massacre
"
franchise.
In
the
background
of
Urgot's
Butcher
skin,
you
can
see
"Manatee
1/2
off".
This
is
a
reference
to
Urf,
the
Manatee
.
Its
said
that
Warwick
sold
Urf,
the
Manatee's
flesh
after
he
killed
him.
Urgot's
Crabgot
skin
is
a
reference
to
the
Giant
Enemy
Crab
in
Genji:
Days
of
the
Blade
,
which
became
a
popular
internet
meme.
Urgot's
Crabgot
Splash
Art
is
likely
a
reference
to
"
Creature
from
the
Black
Lagoon
",
a
classic
1954
monster
horror
film.
Urgot's
Crabgot
skin
is
often
compared
to
the
visual
look
of
the
Crab
People
from
South
Park
series.
In
Nautilus
Art
Spotlight,
around
2:50,
a
tab
saying
Urgot
Mech
can
be
seen
in
the
top
left.
This
was
likely
the
development
name
for
Battlecast
Urgot.
Garen's
sword
is
visible
in
the
background
of
Urgot's
Battlecast
skin.
In
addition,
the
banner
of
Demacia
lies
torn
beneath
one
of
his
legs,
as
does
the
helmet
worn
by
the
champion
shown
in
the
images
of
some
summoner
spells.
Urgot
shares
the
Battlecast
theme
with
Battlecast
Xerath
,
Battlecast
Cho'Gath
and
Battlecast
Vel'Koz
.
Relations
When
Urgot
was
still
a
Noxian
field
soldier,
his
commanding
officer
was
Sion
.
When
Urgot
became
the
High
Executioner
of
Noxus
,
he
was
attached
to
Swain's
military
division.
Before
Urgot
could
execute
the
captured
Jarvan
IV
,
the
Dauntless
Vanguard
and
their
leader
Garen
interfered
at
the
final
moment.
Urgot
was
cut
in
two
by
the
zealous
warrior
as
he
scrambled
to
free
the
Demacian
Prince.
Professor
Stanwick
Pididly,
using
research
notes
stolen
from
Viktor
,
reconstructed
Urgot
into
a
cyborg
body
of
his
own
design.
The
experiment
was
a
success
largely
due
to
Urgot's
sheer
thirst
for
vengeance
against
Garen,
whom
he
entered
the
League
to
kill.
