Poison
Trail
is
very
effective
for
farming
and
harassing
,
allowing
Singed
to
dominate
his
lane.
Poisoning
the
opposing
minions
as
they
advance
is
an
effective
strategy
for
farming
lanes.
A
good
strategy
for
farming
is
to
push
your
minions
to
the
enemy
turret,
then
run
past
it
to
poison
the
next
wave
as
it
comes.
However,
this
puts
you
behind
the
enemy
tower,
so
be
wary
of
ganks.
When
facing
melee
champions,
you
are
capable
of
zoning
them
by
poisoning
the
area
near
your
own
minions
so
their
farming
capabilities
are
hindered
severely.
Turn
off
Poison
Trail
when
unnecessary
as
it
drains
mana
quickly.
Poison
Trail
goes
invisible
to
opponents
when
you
enter
brush.
It
is
also
possible
to
create
a
very
faint
poison
cloud
by
quickly
double
tapping
your
Poison
Trail
.
When
poisoning
the
area
while
being
chased,
consider
how
close
the
enemies
are
to
you,
taking
gap
closers
into
account,
as
well
as
your
health.
If
you
can
afford
to
run
in
a
zig-zag
pattern,
do
so
to
make
sure
your
opponents
will
be
poisoned
at
least
once.
Mega
Adhesive
is
one
of
the
best
slows
in
the
game,
and
it
should
have
at
least
one
rank
before
level
5.
The
upper
ranks
simply
increase
the
slows
percentage.
A
well-played
Singed
can
lead
a
target
with
the
glue,
catch
up
to
the
target,
then
Fling
him
back
in
to
the
glue
for
maximum
effect.
This
may
take
some
practice,
as
all
ranks
have
only
a
5
second
duration.
Fling
is
your
most
versatile
ability
and
can
be
used
to
toss
enemies
into
your
turret
,
isolate
them
from
their
teammates
to
set
up
an
allied
ambush,
and
save
lives
by
tossing
enemies
away
from
weak
or
fleeing
allies.
Be
sure
to
use
it
at
the
extent
of
its
range,
the
further
you
are
from
a
target
when
you
Fling
it,
the
further
they
will
get
tossed
behind
you.
Near
thin
walls,
this
can
be
used
to
throw
an
enemy
across,
repositioning
them
in
an
unfavorable
location.
Fling
can
be
used
to
interrupt
channeled
abilities/ultimates
such
as
Absolute
Zero
,
Infinite
Duress
,
Nether
Grasp
,
or
knock
away
champions
with
strong
non-channeled
point-blank
AoE
like
Crowstorm
,
Slicing
Maelstrom
and
Soul
Shackles
.
Insanity
Potion
is
useful
for
chasing
enemies
and
is
a
useful
asset
in
any
major
team
battle
for
its
all-round
bonuses.
It
has
an
incredibly
short
cooldown
considering
its
bonuses,
so
don't
worry
about
wasting
it
to
run
away
from
a
gank
gone
wrong.
Its
short
cooldown
also
means
it
can
be
used
in
lane
to
simply
regenerate
mana
and
hp
.
Using
Fling
to
throw
an
enemy
into
your
Poison
Trail
is
a
very
simple
but
an
effective
harassment
combo.
Although
not
a
caster
in
the
true
sense,
Singed
benefits
greatly
from
magic
penetration
runes
to
make
sure
your
opponents
get
full
damage
from
Poison
Trail
.
A
full
caster
setup
will
allow
him
to
deal
quite
heavy
damage
with
the
capability
of
tanking.
Consider
leveling
Mega
Adhesive
before
Fling
,
as
this
spell
grants
you
better
zone
control
and
CC,
granting
you
high
value
of
75%
slow,
instead
of
Fling
,
which
grants
you
only
50
bonus
damage
per
level
and
increases
its
mana
cost.
Fling
must
be
used
wisely
when
diving
a
turret,
if
you
are
low
level
and
the
enemy
is
on
the
side
of
the
turret
facing
your
base
you
can
E
+
W
easily
to
attack,
however
take
into
consideration
that
if
you
toss
the
enemy
when
he
moves
on
the
other
side
of
the
turret
you
could
possibly
land
him
near
to
the
turret
and
take
lots
of
damage
or
land
him
further
into
the
enemy
lane
and
force
your
ally/partner
to
have
to
walk
through
the
jungle
or
make
his
escape
easier.
When
you
use
Fling
,
you
can
autoattack
him
at
the
same
time.
This
is
done
by
clicking
on
the
enemy
champion
while
he
is
in
mid-air.
The
damage
of
Singed
autoattack
can,
in
early
game
at
least,
be
just
that
little
bit
of
damage
which
forces
your
opponent
to
play
passive
or
maybe
even
recall.
Singed
is
one
of
the
only
champions
who
can
proxy,
which
is
running
behind
enemy
lines
to
kill
off
their
minions
before
they
reach
the
person
who's
pushing
the
lane,
due
to
Poison
Trail
.
Lissandra
can
do
this
with
her
W
and
E
skills
as
well.
Build
usage
Building
mana
as
Singed
is
a
good
idea
because
of
Empowered
Bulwark
,
it
is
sometimes
more
cost
effective
to
buy
health
directly
because
100
gold
invested
in
mana
will
also
give
you
health
worth
33
gold.
An
early
Tear
of
the
Goddess
will
not
only
help
with
mana
issues,
but
will
also
grant
health
through
Empowered
Bulwark
.
With
Poison
Trail
,
Tear
of
the
Goddess
will
constantly
accumulate
stacks.
Note,
however,
that
quickly
toggling
Poison
Trail
is
the
best
way
to
gain
stacks,
and
he
will
eventually
have
mana
problems
(3-5
minutes
with
a
"blank"
tear),
simply
by
poisoning
as
little
as
possible
to
farm
his
lane.
Catalyst,
overall,
provides
more
mana.
Later
upgrading
to
a
Archangel's
Staff
will
grant
quite
a
bit
of
AP.
If
he
manages
to
gain
enough
charges
he
will
gain
a
Seraph's
Embrace
,
offering
up
additional
durability
in
the
shield.
Because
Singed's
gameplay
is
very
dependent
on
positioning,
consider
starting
with
Boots
of
Speed
and
picking
up
other
speed
items
as
you
play.
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
is
great,
slowing
enemies
by
15%
through
Poison
Trail
,
and
synergizing
for
an
extremely
powerful
slow
with
Mega
Adhesive
.
One
of
the
better
advanced
items
for
early/mid-game
is
Catalyst
the
Protector
.
This
can
then
build
offensively
into
an
early
Rod
of
Ages
.
Rod
of
Ages
is
useful
to
buy
as
early
as
possible
for
any
general
build.
It
provides
significant
mana,
HP
and
AP.
By
itself
it
grants
Singed
a
total
of
812
extra
HP
when
maxed.
ROA
is
a
more
consistant
item
than
Seraphs,
because
the
health
gained
through
ROA
is
always
there,
whereas
seraphs
provides
a
smaller
health
boost.
With
full
mana,
the
shield
active
it
gives
will
enable
you
to
absorb
more
damage
than
you
could
with
ROA.
However,
situational
use
requires
use
at
the
proper
point
in
a
fight.
So,
if
you
are
not
used
to
activating
items
or
often
forget,
a
ROA
may
be
more
efficient.
Cooldown
reduction
is
probably
the
most
effective
stat
to
build,
because
it
allows
you
to
Fling
,
apply
Mega
Adhesive
,
and
pop
Insanity
Potion
more
often,
an
Elixir
of
Brilliance
can
help
substantially
with
cooldowns
and
a
nice
ability
power
boost.
A
utility
Singed's
focus
is
on
surviving
and
disrupting
as
often
and
effectively
as
possible.
For
this,
items
like
Frozen
Heart
are
a
great
choice.
An
early
Ancient
Coin
can
help
overcome
the
mana
cost
of
Singed's
abilities.
Late
game,
this
can
be
built
into
a
Talisman
of
Ascension
for
additional
stats/the
movespeed
boost.
Remember
to
use
it
defensively
as
well
as
offensively,
as
nearby
teammates
will
benefit
from
it
as
well.
A
Zhonya's
Hourglass
is
a
possible
item
for
its
armor
and
ability
power
.
Consider
a
Will
of
the
Ancients
on
Singed
later
on,
as
the
AP/spell
vamp
aura
also
affects
nearby
allies.
During
team
fights,
the
massive
amount
of
poison
can
heal
a
deceptively
large
amount
on
Singed
,
and
a
late-game
Fling
can
also
restore
a
portion
of
your
health.
And
you
can
also
restore
a
lot
of
health
when
escaping
with
Poison
Trail
.
It
is
possible
(although
usually
not
encouraged)
to
build
somewhat
tanky
hybrid
on
Singed
using
Muramana
,
Seraph's
Embrace
,
Rod
of
Ages
,
Atma's
Impaler
and
Warmog's
Armor
.
Lich
Bane
is
a
very
powerful
item
to
increase
Singed's
burst
damage.
It
allows
you
to
deal
some
extra
damage
with
your
guaranteed
auto
attack
after
flinging
the
enemy
backwards.
On
top
of
that,
the
extra
movement
speed
will
synergize
with
the
flat
movement
speed
buff
from
Insanity
Potion
and
the
mana
will
give
some
health
with
Empowered
Bulwark
.

Singed
can
be
zoned
early
game
to
prevent
him
from
becoming
farmed.
His
Poison
Trail
is
fairly
weak
against
players
early
game,
but
doesn't
stop
him
from
being
excellent
at
lane-control.
It
is
often
not
best
to
chase
Singed
.
He
has
great
mobility
with
Insanity
Potion
and
a
great
escape
ability
with
Mega
Adhesive
.
Keep
in
mind
that
while
chasing
Singed
,
Poison
Trail
will
slowly
drain
your
health
away
while
Insanity
Potion
will
regenerate
his
health
back
and
due
to
its
long
duration,
Singed
can
run
back
and
deal
the
finishing
blow
on
you
with
Fling
.
Singed's
threatening
abilities
are
position-based,
so
harassment
is
doubly
effective
if
it
involves
a
slow,
such
as
Wither
or
Lucent
Singularity
.
Singed
has
to
be
very
close
to
your
team
to
do
damage,
so
ranged
champions
are
effective
at
taking
him
out.
However,
be
wary
of
his
Fling
as
it
will
easily
pull
you
into
danger.
Buying
a
Banshee's
Veil
will
make
Singed
think
twice
before
using
his
Fling
on
you
as
it
is
his
only
single-targeted
spell
that
breaks
the
spell
shield.
Buying
a
Frozen
Mallet
on
a
ranged
champion
can
reduce
the
risk
an
enemy
Singed
poses
to
the
team,
the
slow
can
severely
hamper
the
effect
of
Singed
due
to
his
reliance
on
mobility.
