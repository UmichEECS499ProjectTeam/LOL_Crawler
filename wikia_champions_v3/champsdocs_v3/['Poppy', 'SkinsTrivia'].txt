Trivia
Poppy
was
designed
by
Coronach
.
Poppy
was
the
first
Champion
released
in
2010.
Poppy
is
the
first
and
so
far
only
additional
post-release
champion
to
cost
1350
at
the
time
of
champion
release.
All
other
1350
champions
were
already
present
at
game
launch.
Poppy
is
one
of
two
champions
that
went
into
the
weekly
champion
rotation
on
the
day
of
their
release,
the
other
being
Udyr
.
Poppy
shares
a
place
with
Maokai
in
having
the
highest
base
armor
of
any
champion
at
level
18
(90
armor).
Quotes
Poppy's
quote
"Fighting
is
serious
business"
is
a
reference
to
a
well-known
internet
meme,
"X
is
srs
bsns
(serious
business),"
meant
to
troll
people
that
take
something
seriously
with
X
being
the
subject
at
hand
(e.g.
WoW
is
serious
business,
Pokemon
is
serious
business).
Poppy's
quote
"Let
me
demonstrate
Hammer
Diplomacy!"
is
a
possible
reference
to
Nietzsche's
book
"Twilight
of
the
Gods"
or
"How
to
Philosophize
with
a
Hammer",
which
serves
as
an
introduction
to
all
his
other
works.
More
likely,
"Hammer
Diplomacy"
is
a
reference
to
"
Big
Stick
Diplomacy
",
also
known
as
"
gunboat
diplomacy
."
Skins
Lollipoppy
skin
is
possibly
a
reference
to
the
Oompa
Loompas
from
Charlie
and
the
Chocolate
Factory
.
The
skin
may
also
be
a
reference
to
the
beloved
child's
board
game
Candy
Land
.
Ragdoll
Poppy
is
a
reference
to
the
fictional
character
Raggedy
Anne
,
who
appears
in
a
series
of
books
illustrated
for
young
children.
Noxian
Poppy's
face
paint
and
outfit
strongly
resemble
the
face
paint
and
outfits
of
the
band
KISS
.
Battle
Regalia
Poppy
skin
was
inspired
by
ChiZ's
White
Knight
Poppy
skin,
who
also
inspired
Riot
with
his
Swashbuckler
Katarina
skin.
Scarlet
Hammer
Poppy
may
be
a
reference
to
the
game
Spiral
Knights,
as
one
of
the
shields
in
the
game
is
known
as
the
'Scarlet
Shield'.
The
artwork
also
bears
a
striking
resemblance
to
some
types
of
armor
worn
by
the
Spiral
Knights.
The
Chinese
version
of
Poppy's
original
skin
is
the
background
image
of
the
Defense
section
in
the
mastery
pages.
Relations
According
to
Poppy's
lore,
her
father
was
given
the
job
to
craft
a
helm
glorious
beyond
all
comparison.
Poppy
was
given
the
honor
of
helping
him
craft
the
helm
and
was
entrusted
to
set
the
center
jewel,
the
most
important
piece.
After
her
father's
death,
Poppy
unsuspectingly
stopped
under
Galio's
shadow
while
on
her
way
to
Demacia.
As
Galio
observed
Poppy's
continued
determination
and
bravery,
he
became
inspired.
Remembering
the
cause
that
his
master
had
died
defending,
Galio
arose
from
his
silent
purgatory
with
a
new
sense
of
purpose:
to
join
the
League
of
Legends
and
fight
for
the
will
of
Demacia.
From
the
Journal
of
Justice
,
pirates
from
Bilgewater
boarded
a
Bandle
City
ship
headed
to
Demacia
and
sacked
the
vessel
of
its
goods.
This
particular
shipment
was
on
its
way
to
a
celebration,
a
commemoration
to
Poppy's
appointment
to
service
as
envoy
between
Demacia
and
the
yordles.
Tristana
and
Teemo
led
special
forces
to
apprehend
the
culprits,
though
they
were
unable
to
salvage
the
cargo.
