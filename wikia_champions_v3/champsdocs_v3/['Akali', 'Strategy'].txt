usage
Beyond
rank
1,
the
Mark
of
the
Assassin
debuff
lasts
longer
than
the
cooldown
,
allowing
Akali
to
cast
Mark
of
the
Assassin
followed
by
Shadow
Dance
,
then
finishing
with
another
Mark
of
the
Assassin
for
extremely
high
bursts
of
damage.
More
specifically,
Mark
of
the
Assassin
-->
wait
for
the
cooldown
-->
Shadow
Dance
-->
autoattack
-->
Mark
of
the
Assassin
-->
autoattack.
If
you
are
under
level
six,
you
can
surprise
enemies
low
on
health
by
substituting
Shadow
Dance
with
Flash
to
get
a
kill.
Due
to
the
low
cooldowns
of
Akali's
damaging
abilities
,
the
constant
usage
of
Mark
of
the
Assassin
followed
up
by
auto
attacks
can
prevent
her
from
running
out
of
energy
.
This
also
allows
her
to
heal
more
due
to
her
innate
spell
vamp
.
The
stealth
and
slow
of
Twilight
Shroud
can
be
used
offensively
to
provide
cover
and
allow
her
to
chain
skill
combos
on
the
enemy
more
quickly,
but
can
also
be
used
defensively
to
prevent
drawing
enemy
focus
during
team
fights
and
to
provide
aid
in
retreating
after
team
fights
or
running
from
ganks.
Be
wary
of
vision
wards
,
as
well
as
champion
abilities
that
may
reveal
you.
Twilight
Shroud
is
great
for
running
from
enemies
in
the
jungle,
especially
near
brush
,
as
you
can
overlap
them
to
break
vision
with
both
the
brush
and
Twilight
Shroud
to
juke
enemies.
You
can
drop
a
Sight
Ward
or
a
Twilight
Shroud
over
a
wall
and
use
the
vision
provided
to
Shadow
Dance
to
a
monster
over
the
wall.
The
ability
can
also
be
used
to
check
brushes
for
enemies
as
the
stealth
prevents
you
from
being
seen
by
enemy
champions
in
the
same
brush
.
Shadow
Dancing
to
nearby
minions
can
be
useful
to
quickly
disengage.
The
armor
and
magic
resistance
bonus
from
Twilight
Shroud
may
not
be
significant
but
can
be
enough
to
save
you
from
abilities
like
Requiem
,
so
keep
this
is
mind
as
well.
Crescent
Slash
is
great
for
farming
gold
by
last
hitting
minions
and
pushing
lanes
as
it
deals
AoE
damage.
Crescent
Slash
can
be
used
to
proc
her
Mark
of
the
Assassin
if
an
enemy
is
just
out
of
range
for
an
autoattack
or
when
you
are
blinded.
Be
careful
of
the
high
energy
cost
at
low
ranks
to
avoid
being
caught
without
enough
energy
for
Twilight
Shroud
.
Akali's
strength
greatly
increases
once
she
gains
access
to
Shadow
Dance
.
Before
level
six,
you
will
oftentimes
not
be
able
to
get
close
enough
to
enemies
to
proc
her
main
damaging
ability
,
Mark
of
the
Assassin
.
Once
you
hit
your
first
3
stacks
of
Shadow
Dance
,
look
around
the
map
for
an
easy
gank
.
Akali
is
an
excellent
roamer
due
to
her
burst
damage
and
chasing
power.
If
an
enemy
is
out
of
range
,
you
can
use
Shadow
Dance
on
an
enemy
minion
to
close
the
distance,
allowing
you
to
catch
up
with
Flash
or
another
Shadow
Dance
.
Build
usage
Hextech
Gunblade
is
an
essential
item
for
Akali
and
should
probably
be
purchased
as
a
second
or
third
item.
The
additional
attack
damage
and
ability
power
is
useful
for
Twin
Disciplines
as
well
as
built-in
life
steal
and
spell
vamp
.
Getting
an
early
Hextech
Revolver
is
beneficial
for
early
game
sustain,
along
with
Twin
Disciplines
.
Akali
can
deal
a
massive
amount
of
burst
damage
with
Lich
Bane
combined
with
her
passive
by
auto-attacking
an
enemy
marked
with
Mark
of
the
Assassin
.
Since
Akali
is
an
assassin
capable
of
dealing
heavy
burst
damage
to
a
single
target,
she
is
heavily
countered
by
the
target's
magic
resist
.
Therefore,
purchasing
a
Void
Staff
and/or
an
Abyssal
Scepter
will
ensure
she
can
take
out
targets
and
keep
her
damage
relevant
throughout
the
game.
Either
item
probably
should
be
purchased
after
boots
and
Hextech
Gunblade
.
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
is
a
great
item
to
get
because
the
slow
is
applied
with
her
Mark
of
the
Assassin
and
Shadow
Dance
,
allowing
her
to
stick
to
targets
better
and
reducing
the
chance
that
they
get
away.
The
additional
health
also
helps
keep
her
alive
longer
during
teamfights
or
small
skirmishes.
Liandry's
Torment
may
be
an
excellent
choice
especially
when
paired
with
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
or
Akali's
Twilight
Shroud
.
The
percent
health
damage
is
doubled
for
any
target
that
is
slowed.
With
her
low
cooldowns,
Akali
can
maintain
the
debuff
on
an
enemy
constantly.
Because
the
base
damage
and
ability
power
ratios
of
Akali's
abilities
are
fairly
poor,
Rabadon's
Deathcap
is
highly
beneficial,
granting
her
more
ability
power
and
further
complimenting
her
damage
with
Twin
Disciplines
.
Purchasing
Mejai's
Soulstealer
early
can
make
you
very
powerful
late
game
if
you
are
able
to
earn
a
decent
number
of
kills
without
dying.
Although
this
is
extremely
beneficial,
it
is
situational,
relying
on
your
early
game
performance
and
continued
success.
Getting
Guinsoo's
Rageblade
allows
you
to
make
full
use
of
Akali's
Twin
Disciplines
;
its
passives
also
allow
you
to
do
more
damage
and
stay
in
prolonged
fights
longer.
Choosing
this
instead
of
Hextech
Gunblade
is
based
on
if
you
want
the
attack
speed/damage
passive
of
Guinsoo's
Rageblade
or
the
spell
vamp
of
Hextech
Gunblade
.
Nashor's
Tooth
can
be
a
decent
item
on
Akali
as
it
provides
her
with
AP
and
the
valuable
20%
cdr,
which
allows
her
to
wait
less
time
for
her
delayed
burst.
The
item's
passive
also
synergies
well
with
her
passive,
and
the
attack
speed
makes
her
a
surprisingly
fast
tower
killer,
as
her
passive
does
proc
on
towers.

Countering
Akali
is
most
effective
when
making
quick
kills.
The
longer
she
has
to
stick
around
in
a
fight
the
more
susceptible
she
is
of
taking
a
heavy
amount
of
damage
.
She
isn't
as
effective
against
durable
opponents
because
of
her
low
base
health
and
that
she
is
a
champion
that
has
to
burst
a
target
down
quickly.
When
Akali
uses
Twilight
Shroud
,
she
is
very
vulnerable
because
she
will
use
Twilight
Shroud
to
hide
and
wait
for
her
abilities
to
come
off
cooldown.
Having
a
Vision
Ward
will
make
her
vulnerable
and
easier
to
take
down.
Morgana
can
damage
Akali
with
Soul
Shackles
,
despite
being
invisible
due
to
her
Twilight
Shroud
.
This
can
be
an
effective
way
to
damage
her
in
her
Twilight
Shroud
,
potentially
forcing
her
to
run
from
her
cover.
After
Akali's
burst,
she
has
to
wait
for
her
cooldowns
in
order
to
deal
her
burst
damage
again,
which
takes
a
while,
even
with
cooldown
runes
and
masteries.
If
fighting
against
her,
use
this
time
to
take
her
down.
When
you
are
chasing
her,
make
sure
you
are
aware
of
the
amount
of
HP
you
have,
due
to
the
fact
that
she
can
nuke
quite
easily
and
score
another
kill
on
you.
Against
an
Akali
,
play
more
offensively
until
she
reaches
level
6;
try
to
deny
her
early
game,
as
she
usually
has
the
advantage
once
she
gets
her
Shadow
Dance
.
Akali
has
very
few
offensive
items
early
game.
Zone
her
out
so
she
can
not
farm,
which
will
further
delay
her
from
getting
her
Shadow
Dance
.
Once
she
does
hit
6
try
to
bait
her
into
using
her
ability
on
you
if
you
can
take
it,
as
she
is
less
effective
the
less
charges
she
has.
Twilight
Shroud
will
stealth
her
only
if
she
remains
in
the
AoE
,
Meaning
that
she
will
be
out
of
stealth
when
she
is
out
of
the
AoE
or
attacking.
Try
to
move
out
of
the
AoE
as
fast
as
possible
to
prevent
her
from
bursting
you
while
in
stealth,
or
pick
up
a
Vision
Ward
if
she
seems
to
be
over
using
it.
Take
great
care
when
chasing
Akali
,
as
her
Shadow
Dance
and
her
Twilight
Shroud
will
make
her
a
very
effective
juker
and
escape
artist.
Stun
or
silence
her
if
she
is
being
over-aggressive.
Champions
with
AoE
abilities
or
reveals
(such
as
Lee
Sin
)
can
be
an
extremely
effective
counter.
Building
The
Lightbringer
allows
ADCs
to
put
more
damage
onto
Akali
,
as
well
as
countering
her
Twilight
Shroud
.
Hitting
Akali
with
hard
CC
makes
her
exremely
vulnerable.
Good
Akali
players
can
use
Shadow
Dance
to
jump
out
of
a
fight
if
there
are
nearby
minions
or
neutral
monsters.
