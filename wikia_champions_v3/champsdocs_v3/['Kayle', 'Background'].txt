Kayle
Champion
Background
Strategy
Skins
&
Trivia
Lore
In
a
world
far
away
where
an
ancient
war
still
rages,
Kayle
was
a
great
heroine
-
the
strongest
of
an
immortal
race
committed
to
destroying
evil
wherever
it
could
be
found.
For
ten
thousand
years,
Kayle
fought
tirelessly
for
her
people,
wielding
her
flaming
sword
forged
before
time
itself.
She
shielded
her
delicate
features
beneath
her
enchanted
armor,
the
sole
remaining
masterpiece
of
an
extinct
race
of
craftsmen.
Though
a
beautiful,
striking
creature,
Kayle,
now
as
then,
avoids
showing
her
face;
war
has
taken
a
terrible
toll
upon
her
spirit.
In
her
quest
for
victory,
she
sometimes
would
try
to
lift
the
wicked
up
from
their
morass
of
evil,
but
more
than
often
she
instead
purged
those
she
herself
deemed
beyond
redemption.
To
Kayle,
justice
can
so
often
be
an
ugly
thing.
Ten
years
ago,
Kayle's
war
against
evil
was
nearly
won...
until
her
rebellious
sister
Morgana
,
a
pariah
amongst
their
people,
suddenly
gained
powerful
new
allies:
magicians
of
a
hitherto
unknown
world
called
Runeterra
.
Morgana
traded
servitude
to
a
number
of
the
summoners
in
Runeterra's
League
of
Legends
for
powerful
new
abilities
that,
if
mastered,
threatened
to
bring
Kayle
and
her
people
to
their
knees.
To
save
her
world,
Kayle
had
no
choice
but
to
make
a
pact
with
the
League
herself.
She
approached
the
leader
of
the
League,
High
Counselor
Reginald
Ashram,
with
a
deal
of
her
own.
In
exchange
for
a
thousand
years
of
Kayle's
service,
Ashram
halted
all
League
interference
on
Kayle's
world.
With
Ashram's
disappearance
five
years
ago,
Kayle
has
new
causes
on
Valoran
:
find
out
who
or
what
caused
Ashram
to
disappear,
defeat
her
sister
Morgana
upon
the
Fields
of
Justice
,
and
bring
her
own
brand
of
justice
to
the
League
of
Legends.
"In
the
League
of
Legends,
Justice
comes
on
swift
wings."
