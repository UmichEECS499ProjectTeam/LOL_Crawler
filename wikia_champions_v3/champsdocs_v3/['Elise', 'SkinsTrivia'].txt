Trivia
Elise
was
designed
by
Coronach
and
Meddler
.
[1]
Elise
is
voiced
by
Karen
Strassman
,
who
also
voices
Cassiopeia
,
Fiora
,
Shyvana
,
and
Zyra
.
Elise's
name
is
short
for
"Elizabeth"
or
"Elisabeth",
which
is
the
Greek
translation
of
the
Hebrew
name
"Elisheva",
meaning
"God's
promise",
the
"oath
of
God"
or
"I
am
God’s
daughter".
This
is
possibly
a
reference
to
her
lore
where
she
worships
a
mythical
spider
god.
Elise
currently
holds
the
record
for
having
the
most
movable
pets
on
the
Field,
which
is
5.
Elise
is
the
first
champion
to
have
a
monologue
during
the
log-in
screen.
The
second
being
Lissandra
,
the
third
being
Lucian
,
and
the
fourth
being
Yasuo
.
Elise's
dance
is
based
off
of
the
Can-Can
,
a
dance
featuring
high
kicks
and
provocative
body
movements.
A
side-by-side
video
of
both
her
human
and
spider
form
can
be
seen
here
.
Elise
bears
some
resemblance
to
the
goddess
Lolth
from
Forgotten
Realms
who
can
also
change
spider
and
humanoid
form
Elise's
Human
form
bears
some
resemblance
to
Black
Arachnia
,
from
the
Transformers
franchise.
The
name
Elise
or
'Élise'
come
from
a
feminine
name
of
French
origin.
In
grammar,
it
means
either
'elect',
and
'vote.
The
word
'Elise'
may
be
spelled
as
'Elire',
both
of
them
have
synonymous
meanings.
Quotes
Elise
shares
a
quote
with
Cho'Gath
:
"Ah,
the
tangled
webs
we
weave."
Coincidentally,
the
quote
is
also
shared
with
a
spider-like
unit
from
Blizzard's
Warcraft
3,
the
Crypt
Fiend
Elise's
quote,
"I
can
feel
their
fear."
,
is
similar
to
Evelynn's
quote,
"I
can
smell
their
fear"
and
Fiddlesticks's
quote,
"I
feel
your
fear."
Skins
Teaser
for
Victorious
Elise
Skin
Elise's
Classic
Spider
form
and
general
motif
is
based
off
the
black
widow
spider
,
a
popular
species
used
in
western
culture
to
represent
deadly
female
characters.
This
is
mostly
evident
in
her
classic
skin's
general
black
and
red
color
schemes
and
is
most
prominent
in
her
spider
form,
where
much
like
a
black
widow,
her
abdomen
sports
matching
red
markings.
Likewise,
Death
Blossom
Elise
skin
is
based
off
the
crab
spider
species.
This
might
also
be
reference
to
the
Spider
Queen
from
Okami
as
both
have
flowers
for
abdomens.
The
Victorious
Elise
skin
is
a
reward
for
players
who
achieve
a
Gold
or
higher
ranking
by
the
end
of
Season
3.
Design
&
Concept
Elise's
concept
was
in
development
stage
three
years
ago
under
the
name
Priscilla,
the
Spider
Queen
.
Elise
is
the
third
champion
to
have
access
to
her
ultimate
and
another
ability
at
level
1,
the
others
being
Karma
and
Jayce
.
Elise
,
Jayce
and
Karma
are
the
only
three
champions
who
can
have
19
skill
points
allocated
by
level
18,
because
they
get
a
level
in
their
ultimate
at
level
1
for
free.
Elise
is
the
fifth
champion
to
have
a
transformation
ability.
The
others
being
Nidalee
,
Swain
,
Shyvana
,
Zyra
and
Quinn
.
Elise
is
one
of
the
two
champions
that
can
transform
before
level
6,
the
other
being
Zyra
.
Elise
is
one
of
six
champions
to
have
more
than
4
skills,
the
other
being
Nidalee
,
Jayce
,
Rengar
,
Karma
and
Lee
Sin
.
Elise
was
the
fifth
champion
to
have
more
than
4
skills.
Elise
is
one
of
the
five
champions
who
is
labeled
as
both
melee
and
ranged,
the
other
four
being
Kayle
,
Quinn
,
Nidalee
and
Jayce
.
The
rework
of
the
Twisted
Treeline
appears
to
have
drawn
much
influence
from
Elise's
design.
This
includes
spider
webs
and
the
new
monster,
Vilemaw
,
who
is
also
a
spider-like
creature.
Elise
,
Evelynn
,
Hecarim
,
Karthus
,
Mordekaiser
,
and
Yorick
can
trigger
quotes
dedicated
only
for
champions
that
came
from
the
Shadow
Isles
while
capturing
altars
on
the
Twisted
Treeline
.
These
quotes
can
be
heard
here
.
Her
left
hand
is
drawn
with
a
spider-like
quality
and
when
she
taps
her
fingers
in
her
animation
it
looks
like
a
spider
crawling.
Relations
Elise
owes
her
allegiance
to
Vilemaw
[2]
of
the
Shadow
Isles
.
Despite
this,
she
has
no
unique
interactions
with
Vilemaw
.
Other
champions
that
serve
the
Shadow
Isles
are
Hecarim
,
Karthus
,
Mordekaiser
,
Thresh
and
Yorick
.
Elise
is
allied
with
LeBlanc
,
hinting
that
Elise
may
have
been
a
member
of
the
Black
Rose
once.

Elise's
Theme
"The
Shadow
Isles
–
They
say
they
don't
exist.
Mythical
islands
haunted
by
ghosts
and
specters.
Tales
to
frighten
children.
But
I
know
better.
I
have
been
there.
When
I
first
set
foot
there
I
immediately
knew
something
was
wrong
with
that
place.
My
skin
crawled
and
in
the
pit
of
my
stomach
I
felt
a
terrible
revulsion.
Life
didn't
belong
there.
But
I
also
knew...
somehow,
deep
inside
I
knew,
that
the
islands
welcomed
me.
They
wanted
me."
"As
I
wandered
deeper
I
saw
death
all
around
me.
Ghostly
trees,
grass
and
flowers
engulfed
me
in
their
horrifying
radiance.
It
was
so
quiet
and
so
beautiful.
I
passed
my
hand
through
a
spectral
leaf
fluttering
in
the
wind;
but
there
was
no
wind.
That
was
when
I
understood
that
death
was
another
world
and
I
was
at
its
door."
"Then
I
heard
the
song;
the
spider's
song.
My
companion
cried
out
in
terror
and
fell
to
his
knees.
I
embraced
him.
I
told
him
he
had
nothing
to
fear.
He
was
going
to
a
better
place.
I
will
take
them
all
to
a
better
place.
