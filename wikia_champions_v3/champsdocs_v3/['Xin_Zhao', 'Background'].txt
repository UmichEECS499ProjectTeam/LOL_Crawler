Whenever
Jarvan
III,
the
king
of
Demacia
,
delivers
one
of
his
rallying
speeches
from
the
glinting
marble
balcony
atop
the
Royal
Palace,
Xin
Zhao
is
at
his
side.
Coined
the
Seneschal
of
Demacia,
Xin
Zhao
is
the
personal
steward
of
the
Lightshield
Dynasty.
His
enigmatic,
silent
vigil
has
led
to
an
abundance
of
conjecture
concerning
his
“secret
life”
and
origins.
Whether
it’s
"
Zaun
double-agent"
tendered
at
the
dinner
table
or
"indebted
rune
mage"
mused
in
the
editorials
of
the
Demacian
Constant,
Xin
Zhao
betrays
no
hints
to
sate
the
curiosity
of
the
masses…for
good
reason.
Prior
to
the
formation
of
the
League
,
Noxus
was
renowned
for
a
spectacle
called
The
Fleshing.
It
was
a
gladiatorial
event
with
a
cruel
twist:
as
a
fighter
won
matches,
his
number
of
opponents
(generally
prisoners
of
war)
fought
simultaneously
would
increase.
This
meant
eventual
death
for
every
contender,
but
with
unparalleled
glory.
Xin
Zhao,
known
then
as
Viscero,
was
slated
to
face
300
soldiers,
nearly
six
times
the
previous
record.
This
was
clearly
meant
to
be
his
final
match.
Jarvan
II,
hearing
of
this
unprecedented
feat,
infiltrated
the
arena
to
offer
him
an
alternative:
serve
Demacia
and
punish
those
who
ultimately
sentenced
him
to
death
in
exchange
for
his
freedom.
Xin
Zhao
accepted,
astonished
that
a
king
would
risk
his
own
life
on
his
behalf.
Under
the
cover
of
a
prearranged
Demacian
assault
on
Noxus,
Jarvan
liberated
Xin
Zhao
and
his
300
opponents.
During
their
retreat,
Xin
Zhao
took
a
poisoned
dart
meant
for
Jarvan.
This
act
of
loyalty,
from
a
man
who
vowed
no
allegiance,
earned
Xin
Zhao
a
spot
at
his
side
until
the
day
the
king
died.
Now
in
the
service
of
his
son,
Jarvan
III,
Xin
Zhao
is
stepping
into
a
new
ring
–
the
Fields
of
Justice
–
to
fight
for
his
adopted
country
and
to
honor
the
legacy
of
the
man
who
gave
purpose
to
his
life.
"Death
is
inevitable;
one
can
only
avoid
defeat."

CLE
OBSERVATION
Xin
Zhao's
presence,
although
patently
reserved,
seems
to
resound
throughout
the
Great
Hall
as
he
enters.
An
expression
of
stoic
determination
drapes
across
his
face,
as
oft-worn
as
his
polished
Demacian
plates.
His
signature
topknot
billows
behind
him,
white
streaks
glinting
with
every
flicker
of
the
lamps.
In
one
hand,
he
carries
a
bladed
battering
ram
passed
off
as
a
spear.
He
feigns
difficulty
bearing
its
weight,
a
ploy
to
mislead
those
with
sharp
eyes
but
brash
wits.
His
gaze
never
drifts
from
the
ornate
doors
of
the
Reflecting
Chamber,
but
he
has
analyzed
every
nuance
of
the
Hall,
from
the
spiked
epaulets
adorning
the
Statue
of
Thurmit
to
the
slinking
stress
fracture
snaking
through
the
northern
wall.
He
stalks
to
the
doors
with
a
stride
that
would
be
unhampered
waist-deep
in
tar,
and
pauses
to
examine
the
inscription
etched
above.
The
truest
opponent
lies
within.
With
a
touch,
the
looming
marble
doors
part
obligingly.
Beyond
them,
a
pervasive
blackness
spills
forth,
sprawling
at
his
feet
as
the
doors
widen.
This
murk
–
the
harnessed
essence
of
darkness
–
absorbs
light,
cascading
negative
shadows
around
the
rim
of
the
entryway.
Unimpressed
by
the
conjuration,
Xin
Zhao
steps
into
the
blanketing
ink.
REFLECTION
The
absence
of
light
didn’t
bother
Xin
Zhao
much;
he’d
been
blinded
in
fights
before.
He
touched
his
forehead,
fingers
tracing
a
scar
left
by
the
edge
of
a
Demacian
shield,
remembering
the
sensation
of
blood
pooling
in
his
eyes.
The
wound
was
a
parting
souvenir
from
a
man
the
Noxian
papers
had
called
the
Bone
Grinder.
Funny
name,
really.
They
should
have
called
him
the
Squeaker.
A
gap
in
the
Squeaker’s
teeth
caused
him
to
whistle
whenever
he
exhaled,
an
effect
which
became
quite
ridiculous
when
he
panted.
Xin
Zhao
had
dispatched
the
Squeaker
handily
back
then,
although
cockiness
blinded
him
to
the
obvious
shield
strike.
He
could
still
hear
the
Squeaker’s
fateful
battle
cry
–
tinged
with
that
absurd
whistle
–
amidst
the
roar
of
thousands
of
bloodthirsty
onlookers,
attendants
of
The
Fleshing.
The
familiar
acrid
stench
of
the
arena
still
stung
his
nose,
the
perfume
of
bile
dripping
from
slain
opponents
who
lay
scattered
in
all
directions.
He
could
still
see
the
Squeaker’s
eyes,
lit
with
rage
through
slits
in
his
tarnished
helm,
as
he
feinted
with
his
chipped
broadsword,
shield
poised
to
strike.
Wait,
he
could
see
him.
It
was
a
disorienting
sensation,
watching
an
image
of
the
mind’s
eye
manifesting
in
reality.
Xin
Zhao
had
barely
enough
time
to
duck,
the
tower
shield
raking
the
length
of
his
mane.
Instinctively,
he
dove
away,
falling
unceremoniously
on
his
haunches
but
narrowly
evading
a
spinning
slash
as
the
Squeaker
whirled
about.
His
right
hand
tightened,
seeking
the
reassurance
of
his
spear,
but
his
fingers
grasped
only
palm.
How
had
he
been
disarmed?
The
crowd
above
was
chanting
for
carnage.
Xin
Zhao
glanced
up,
noticing
faces
he’d
seen
before
in
another
life.
Capitalizing
on
his
opponent's
confusion,
the
Squeaker
lunged,
a
fatal
sword
thrust
obscured
behind
his
battered
shield.
Sitting
in
the
sand,
Xin
Zhao
was
caught
unprepared,
too
late
to
dodge,
too
late
to
think.
The
Squeaker’s
blade
slid
into
the
flesh
between
Xin
Zhao’s
eyes,
its
tip
pressing
against
his
skull.
Gazing
dully
forward,
his
eyes
focused
on
the
base
of
the
enemy
blade,
where
he
found
his
left
hand
clenched,
a
crimson
trickle
dripping
down
his
wrist.
He
almost
chuckled.
While
his
mind
reeled,
desperately
trying
to
cope
with
the
recent
series
of
events,
his
body,
ever-vigilant,
never
failed
him.
In
a
single
motion,
Xin
Zhao
was
on
his
feet,
his
right
hand
snapping
the
blade
with
a
decisive
strike.
He
detected
a
squeak
of
surprise
as
he
moved.
His
left
hand
–
still
gripping
the
severed
blade
–
shot
forward,
finding
its
mark
in
the
eye
of
the
Squeaker’s
helm.
A
thick,
wet
sound
echoed
in
return,
followed
by
a
deafening
cheer
from
the
crowd.
To
Xin
Zhao's
horror,
the
Squeaker
did
not
topple
over
as
expected;
instead,
he
sat
down
calmly.
Xin
Zhao
recoiled
into
a
defensive
stance,
but
the
Squeaker
only
yanked
the
shard
from
his
eye
and
shucked
the
helm.
Xin
Zhao
fell
to
his
knees,
at
once
recognizing
the
blood-drenched
face
of
his
mentor,
King
Jarvan
II
of
Demacia.
Jarvan
smiled,
pleased
with
Xin
Zhao’s
distress.
"Why
do
you
want
to
join
the
League,
Xin
Zhao?"
The
whistle
was
gone.
Xin
Zhao’s
voice
cracked,
"What
trickery
is
this?"
"Answer
the
question."
"I
represent
Demacia…and
her...true
king."
Some
part
of
Xin
Zhao
was
aware
that
this
was
a
cruel
mirage,
but
the
weight
in
his
heart
prevailed
over
reason.
"To
defeat
your
archenemy,
Noxus?"
"To
serve
the
best
interests
of
Demacia."
A
pause.
“How
does
it
feel,
exposing
your
mind?”
The
mutilated
eye
twitched,
apparently
attempting
to
study
Xin
Zhao’s
response.
Horrible
beyond
comparison.
"Not
what
I
expected."
"Horrible
beyond
comparison?
Really?"
Jarvan
gestured
at
the
carcasses
all
around
them.
"And
you
have
so
much
in
your
life
to
which
you
could
compare."
"I’ve
had
enough
of
this.
Have
I
passed
your
test?"
Xin
Zhao
was
tired
of
the
game,
tired
of
being
vulnerable.
"We've
finished
with
you
Xin
Zhao,
but
you'll
soon
find
that
the
true
test
has
not
yet
begun."
The
arena
and
the
grinning,
one-eyed
face
of
Jarvan
dissolved
in
a
puff
of
black
smoke.
Xin
Zhao
found
himself
standing
in
a
claustrophobic
antechamber,
facing
a
long
corridor
which
he
knew
led
to
the
League.
Behind
him,
the
ornate
marble
doors
swung
open
softly,
offering
retreat.
He
wanted
to
crumple.
He
wanted
to
turn
and
leave,
never
to
set
eyes
on
this
place
again.
Instead,
he
heard
the
voice
of
Jarvan
in
his
head.
This
time
he
knew
it
wasn't
an
illusion.
"This
world
is
in
need
of
men
with
the
courage
to
bear
weight
which
otherwise
would
crush
us
all.
You’re
a
Demacian
at
heart,
Xin
Zhao.
Have
confidence
in
your
strength,
and
your
knees
will
never
buckle."
Xin
Zhao
rose
to
his
fullest
height
and
marched
into
the
League
of
Legends.
