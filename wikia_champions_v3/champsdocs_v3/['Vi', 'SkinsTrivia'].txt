Trivia
Vi
was
designed
by
gypsylord
.
Vi
is
voiced
by
Cia
Court
.
Vi
features
several
easter
eggs
:
When
playing
with
an
allied
Caitlyn
,
each
gains:
The
cosmetic
buff
"
On
The
Case:
Piltover's
finest
".
+1
movement
speed
while
near
one
another.
+1
bonus
gold
if
they
assisted
on
the
same
kill.
Three
unique
shouts
in
response
to
an
allied
Ace
in
the
Hole
.
When
playing
against
an
enemy
Caitlyn
:
If
Vi
taunts
while
near
an
enemy
Caitlyn,
she
will
perform
one
of
two
special
taunts
.
Doing
so
debuffs
the
Caitlyn
with
"Agitated:
How
Agitating"
,
which
will
remain
until
Caitlyn
damages
Vi
or
Caitlyn
dies.
Vi
features
three
unique
shouts
in
response
to
surviving
an
enemy
Ace
in
the
Hole
.
She
features
a
unique
shout
when
she
uses
Assault
and
Battery
on
an
enemy
Jayce
.
There
may
be
additional
interactions
with
Jayce.
[1]
When
playing
against
an
enemy
Jinx
:
Causes
Vi,
also
to
an
allied
Caitlyn
if
she
is
present,
to
get
a
debuff
"
Catch
me
if
you
can!
".
The
debuff
reads
"Jinx
is
causing
chaos
again.
How
obnoxious...
Criminals
Apprehended:"
followed
by
a
counter
that
represents
the
number
of
Jinx
kills/assists.
+1
bonus
gold
for
every
criminal
they
apprehend.
Vi's
login
theme
("Here
Comes
Vi")
was
sung
by
Nicki
Taylor
,
lead
singer
of
the
band
"Running
the
Risk".
Vi
is
the
second
champion
whose
login
theme
contains
sung
lyrics.
The
first
was
Diana
and
her
theme
"Daylight's
End".
Vi
is
the
first
champion
to
be
revealed
by
a
feedback
thread
rather
than
by
a
sneak
peak
or
art
spotlight.
[2]
Prior
to
her
PBE
release,
Vi's
character
archetype
had
been
in
and
out
of
development
for
two
years.
[3]
Vi
has
the
most
jokes
in
the
game,
at
five,
beating
out
the
previous
record
holders
Swain
and
Lux
at
four.
Vi's
last
two
abilities,
"Excessive
Force"
and
"Assault
and
Battery",
are
named
after
real
criminal
charges.
Excessive
force
is
a
form
of
police
brutality,
while
assault
and
battery
are
two
different
but
similar
crimes.
Both
go
along
with
Vi's
background
and
theme.
Shortly
before
the
release
of
Jinx
,
Vi's
Champion
page
(if
opened
from
the
home
page)
was
'graffitied'
on.
This
was
thought
to
be
a
teaser
of
an
upcoming
champion.
Many
members
of
the
community
believed
it
would
be
her
sister,
a
member
of
the
group
she
was
in,
or
both.
More
information
can
be
found
on
Jinx's
page.
Jinx,
according
to
her
lore,
has
a
history
with
Vi.
Vi
apparently
has
been
a
rival
with
Jinx
ever
since
Jinx
came
to
Piltover.
Vi
is
referred
by
Jinx
as
'fat
hands',
that
is,
due
to
her
giant
gauntlets.
Vi's
dance
is
the
Dougie
.
A
side-by-side
comparison
can
be
seen
here
.
"Vis"
is
latin
for
"force".
To
be
exact,
"Vi"
is
ablative
singular
and
means
"with
force",
which
can
be
related
to
Vi's
design.
VI
is
the
number
6
in
Roman﻿
Numerals.
Because
of
this,
many
players
are
attempting
to
find
some
significance
between
the
number
6
and
Vi.
VI,
being
the
roman
numeral
for
six,
could
be
a
reference
to
her
relationship
with
Caitlyn.
This
meaning
that
she
has
her
partner's
back,
or
in
other
terms
her
'six'.
Vi's
lore
states
that
she
became
part
of
her
former
gang
at
the
age
of
six.
This
could
also
refer
to
the
Sixth
Amendment
(of
the
USA)
,
concerning
criminal
prosecution
which
is
also
a
running
theme
of
Vi.
The
number
6
can
be
seen
on
Vi's
left
breast
in
her
Officer
Vi
skin
Vi
is,
along
with
Caitlyn
,
Lissandra
,
Rumble
,
Varus
,
Xerath
,
and
Ziggs
,
one
of
the
few
champions
that
can
CC
themselves.
Vi
has
the
shortest
name
in
League
of
Legends,
at
two
letters
long.
Vi's
taunt
makes
her
do
the
"Ali
shuffle"
which
fits
well
with
her
punching
theme.
Vi's
ability
kit
contains
all
"knock"
crowd
control
effects:
knockback
on
her
Vault
Breaker
and
both
knockup
and
knock
aside
on
her
Assault
and
Battery
.
Vi
has
a
light
on
her
back
that
when
glowing
indicates
her
passive
Blast
Shield
is
ready
to
use
(similar
to
Annie's
stun).
Neon
Strike
Vi
is
the
only
skin
in
the
game
you
can
interact
with.
When
you
use
/taunt
you
can
take
off
or
put
on
your
glasses.
According
to
ohmikegoodness
at
PAX
2013,
Vi
was
originally
named
"Ruby"
and
rode
around
on
rollerskates
during
her
initial
design.
According
to
ohmikegoodness
during
AMA
about
Aatrox,
Vi
is
left-handed.
[4]
Quotes
Vi
shares
quotes
with
Caitlyn
either
mocking
her
if
they
are
on
opposite
teams
or
praising
her
if
they
are
allied.
"Oh,
look
at
me...
I'm
on
the
case."
(as
opposed
to
just
"I'm
on
the
case."
)
"Boom!
Headshot."
Vi
refers
to
Caitlyn
as
"Cupcake"
in
some
of
her
quotes.
This
is
likely
due
to
Caitlyn's
Yordle
Snap
Trap
featuring
a
cupcake
as
the
bait.
"Cupcake"
can
also
be
a
term
of
endearment
towards
females,
particularly
in
parts
of
the
United
Kingdom,
a
reference
to
Caitlyn's
conspicuous
British
accent.
Vi's
quote
when
using
her
ultimate,
"Get
dunked!"
may
be
a
reference
to
the
"Dunkmaster"
Yi
build
and
video
,
which
repeats
the
phrase
often.
The
quote
comes
from
"Charles
Barkley's
Shut
Up
and
Jam
Gaiden"
a
non-serious
indie
RPG
game.
This
quote
is
often
associated
with
Darius
as
his
ultimate
resembles
a
slam
dunk
.
Many
of
Vi's
quotes
are
cliches
/
catchphrases
with
a
humorous
twist.
Vi's
"Here
I
come
to
save
the
day...or
wreck
it."
is
a
reference
to
the
once-popular
Terrytoons
character
Mighty
Mouse
,
who
would
triumphantly
proclaim
he
had
come
to
save
the
day
in
the
opening
theme.
Vi's
"Nope."
seems
to
be
a
reference
to
Nope
meme
video
about
the
Engineer
class
from
Team
Fortress
2
,
as
she
could
be
considered
an
engineer
as
well.
It
might
also
me
a
reference
to
the
video
Nope,
Jayce!
,
as
both
Vi
and
Jayce
originate
from
Piltover
and
the
exclamation
"Nope!"
is
used
as
a
reaction
to
a
misused
enemy
spell.
Vi
shares
a
quote
with
Brolaf
:
"Boom,
baby!"
Vi's
quote
"We
can
either
do
this
the
hard
way,
or...
Oh
wait,
no.
There's
just
the
hard
way."
is
a
reference
to
a
similar
line
from
Buffy:
the
Vampire
Slayer
.
Also
on
that
show
there
is
a
character
named
Vi
.
Skins
Neon
Strike
Vi's
recall
animation
has
her
perform
a
selection
of
poses
from
One
Piece's
Franky,
a
cyborg
with
enormous
fists.
Neon
Strike
Vi's
hair
color
and
hair
style
is
reminiscent
of
One
Piece's
Franky.
In
Neon
Strike
Vi's
splash
art,
a
letter
M
similar
to
the
McDonalds
logo
can
be
seen
just
below
the
forefinger
of
her
left
arm.
In
Officer
Vi's
splash
art,
Jinx
can
be
seen
laying
in
the
giant
donut
in
the
background.
Officer
Vi's
was
inspired
in
a
work
of
"2gold"
Relations
According
to
Lyte,
the
hermit
in
the
Howling
Abyss
,
Vi
has
a
sister.
Vi
is
partners
with
Caitlyn
in
Piltover
's
Sheriff's
Department.
Vi
has
an
antagonistic
relationship
with
Jinx
refering
to
her
as
a
pain
in
the
neck,
and
obnoxious.

"Here
Comes
Vi"
She's
such
a
misfit.
Always
ready
to
brawl
It's
like
her
business,
roughing
up
your
friends
is
the
law
There
is
no
difference
if
you
believe
you're
strong
She's
a
bulldozer
making
sure
you're
flat
on
the
ground
She's
like
a
boomerang,
who
never
gives
up
She
flies
in
circles
till
she
hits
you
and
you're
biting
the
dust
So
just
remember
this,
when
she's
chasing
you
down
Face
first,
you'll
be
thrown
onto
the
Proving
Grounds
.
She'll
knock
you
out.
Have
you
ever
really
wanted
to
be
a
total
rebel
flippin'
tables
on
the
enemy?
Did
you
ever
try
to
further
improve
how
fast
you
punch
people
through
the
roof?
Oh,
Was
there
ever
any
certain
time
when
you
thought
brute
force
and
style
combined?
Well,
I
guess
now's
time
to
shine.
Cause
finally,
she's
here,
here
comes
Vi
And
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
best
bet
one
has
is
to
quickly
react
To
the
first
attack
that's
aiming
for
the
bones
Cause
she'll
never
pull
back
and
just
risk
it.
