Shyvana
Champion
Background
Strategy
Skins
&
Trivia
Skill
Usage
Shyvana's
strength
comes
from
her
innate
durability
from
Dragonborn
and
her
high
mixed
damage
output,
AoE,
and
utility
from
Burnout
and
Dragon's
Descent
,
along
with
her
ability
to
duel
effectively
with
Flame
Breath
and
Twin
Bite
.
However,
she
lacks
hard
CC
and
is
prone
to
being
kited.
With
good
positioning
and
timing,
Twin
Bite
can
massively
extend
the
duration
of
Dragon's
Descent
.
By
hitting
three
targets,
it
generates
enough
fury
to
stay
in
dragon
form
for
another
two
seconds.
Twin
Bite
is
a
great
turret
pushing
tool,
as
it
allows
you
roughly
three
auto-attacks
worth
of
damage
in
the
time
space
of
~0.8.
(taking
into
account
attack
animation
time
and
casting
time)
Use
Burnout
to
chase
down
or
flee
from
enemies,
as
it
grants
bonus
movement
speed
.
Burnout
provides
the
largest
bonus
movement
speed
at
the
start
of
the
ability.
Activating
it
gives
a
quick
burst
of
speed
that
can
be
used
to
juke
skillshots
and
enemies.
Dragon's
Descent
is
an
excellent
peeling
ability,
if
you
see
a
key
member
of
your
team
(an
ADC
or
APC)
starting
to
get
focused,
use
the
dash
the
knock
the
enemies
off
while
giving
your
ally
enough
distance
to
continue
attacking.
With
good
positioning,
you
can
use
the
ability
to
push
enemies
away
from
your
allies
while
diving
onto
their
backline
to
disrupt
them.
Casting
Burnout
followed
by
Dragon's
Descent
will
lead
to
a
flaming
trail
from
where
you
started
Dragon's
Descent
.
Dragon's
Descent
can
be
used
to
chase
in
or
escape
from
any
situation.
Take
note
that
stuns,
silences,
snares,
knock-ups
and
knockback
effects
can
hit
and
stop
Shyvana
mid-flight.
Beware
of
your
enemies'
capabilities
to
do
these.
Dragon's
Descent
is
one
of
the
longest
dashes
in-game,
as
such
it
allows
going
over
large
walls
and
otherwise
impassable
terrain.
Since
patch
3.9,
Flame
Breath
passes
through
units.
If
you
find
yourself
as
a
laner
(most
likely
top)
putting
points
in
this
ability
gives
you
a
good
harassment
tool
and
can
be
used
to
farm
easily.
It
may
be
worth
maxing
if
you
are
against
a
ranged
opponent
as
Shyvana
has
no
other
ranged
abilities.
To
perform
a
quick
harass,
hit
your
opponent
with
Flame
Breath
and
run
into
them
with
Burnout
,
following
with
a
Twin
Bite
to
proc
the
mark
twice,
putting
out
good
damage
and
extending
Burnout
.
You
can
then
use
the
prolonged
speed
boost
granted
by
Burnout
to
escape
just
as
you
entered.
When
using
Dragon's
Descent
,
try
to
position
yourself
to
be
able
to
hit
as
many
targets
as
you
can
with
your
AoE
abilities.
Attacking
turrets
,
inhibitors
or
the
nexus
does
not
trigger
the
cooldown
reduction
for
Twin
Bite
.
It
does,
however,
reset
her
auto-attack
timer,
build
fury
and
extend
the
duration
of
Burnout
.
While
both
hits
triggered
from
Twin
Bite
deal
on-hit
effects
,
only
the
first
hit
is
able
to
deal
a
critical
strike
.
The
second
hit
only
deals
a
percentage
of
Shyvana's
attack
damage
as
damage.
Shyvana's
kit
allow
her
to
do
large
amount
of
damage
over
time
at
close-range,
but
it
doesn't
provide
her
with
burst
capabilities.
Failure
to
combine
or
land
Shyvana's
abilities
together
to
effectively
damage
a
target
will
create
an
opening
for
a
period
of
time
that
your
opponents
can
take
advantage
of,
so
be
aware
of
your
enemies'
potential
methods
to
disengage
from
you.
Build
Usages
Shyvana
lacks
crowd
control
aside
from
the
knockback
from
Dragon's
Descent
,
which
tends
to
be
unwieldy
and
dubious
in
effectiveness
in
many
cases.
Movement
speed
slowing
items
are
an
effective
source
of
CC
.
Both
Trinity
Force
and
Frozen
Mallet
are
very
powerful
on
Shyvana
,
but
buying
both
is
not
recommended.
Trinity
Force
gives
superior
late-game
damage
and
Frozen
Mallet
is
the
tried-and-true
choice
for
utility
and
tankiness.
On-hit
effect
and
attack
speed
items
have
substantial
synergy
with
Shyvana's
skillset.
They
will
increase
fury
generation,
lower
the
cooldown
on
Twin
Bite
,
proc
the
on-hit
effect
from
Flame
Breath
more
often,
and
increase
her
overall
damage
output
significantly.
The
attack
speed
and
on-hit
damage-effect
of
Wit's
End
synergizes
well
with
Shyvana
,
who
can
also
quickly
accumulate
the
item's
stacks.
Wriggle's
Lantern
and
Wit's
End
offer
an
excellent
combination
of
sustain,
damage
and
durability
from
both
physical
and
magical
damage
for
Shyvana
.
Sunfire
Cape
is
an
excellent
item
for
Shyvana
in
the
mid-game,
combining
a
generally
effective
chunk
of
durability
stats
to
survive
combat
with
a
good
amount
of
free
magic
damage
to
stack
with
Burnout
.
Items
that
grant
attack
speed
and
cooldown
reduction
are
great
offensive
items
for
Shyvana's
abilities,
especially
Twin
Bite
and
Dragon's
Descent
.
Although
Zeke's
Herald
is
more
of
a
support
item,
it
offers
CDR
,
attack
damage
,
health
,
life
steal
and
an
aura
.
Youmuu's
Ghostblade
is
an
excellent
item
for
damage
purposes
on
Shyvana
.
Its
active-effect's
attack
speed
and
movement
speed
help
Shyvana
utilize
her
passive
effects
and
chase,
provides
large
amount
CDR
and
the
armor
penetration
.
Nashor's
Tooth
is
an
effective
item
for
her,
offering
a
very
cost
effective
mix
of
attack
speed
and
CDR
that
it
grants
a
good
deal
of
ability
power
that
scales
well
with
her
Flame
Breath
and
Dragon's
Descent
.
Zephyr
is
great
on
Shyvana
as
it
gives
her
most
of
the
stats
she
needs:
attack
speed
,
CDR
,
attack
damage
,
and
movement
speed
.
Zephyr
also
gives
Shyvana
tenacity
which
allows
her
to
replace
Mercury's
Treads
with
other
boots
While
it
may
seem
odd,
Abyssal
Scepter
will
make
her
highly
resilient
to
magical
burst,
and
vastly
boost
the
damage
Dragon's
Descent
and
Flame
Breath
because
they
scale
with
AP,
but
also
of
Burnout
as
it
deals
magical
damage
and
the
scepter
aura
reduces
MR
Randuin's
Omen
is
a
great
defensive
item
for
Shyvana
.
Its
AoE
active
is
very
useful
due
to
Shyvana
having
a
fairly
minimal
method
for
crowd
control
and
her
kit's
pletheora
of
area
of
effect
abilities
prefers
when
enemies
that
are
close
together
to
stay
that
way
as
long
as
possible.
Aegis
of
the
Legion
synergizes
with
Shyvana's
Dragon's
Descent
passive,
granting
you
a
lot
of
survivability
at
a
small
cost
in
early
game.
Bilgewater
Cutlass
is
a
great
mid
game
item
as
it
helps
Shyvana's
sustainability
along
with
the
unique
effect
that
allows
her
to
stick
to
her
target.
It
can
also
be
built
into
Blade
of
the
Ruined
King
,
which
synergizes
well
with
Burnout
and
Flame
Breath
considering
the
passive
and
active,
and
allows
her
to
maintain
a
strong
late
game
and
be
a
formidable
duelist.
Tiamat
and
its
upgrade,
Ravenous
Hydra
,
can
be
great
cost
effective
items
for
Shyvana
,
offering
attack
damage,
sustain
with
health
regen
and
life
steal
along
with
the
active
and
passive
effect,
which
synergizes
with
Shyvana's
Twin
Bite
,
procing
twice
on
a
single
target.
Tiamat
and
Ravenous
Hydra
share
a
unique
passive
Cleave
,
so
stacking
Tiamat
/
Ravenous
Hydra
doesn't
increase
the
splash
damage.
Twin
Bite
during
Dragon's
Descent
will
only
proc
the
passive
twice
on
the
primary
target
due
to
an
intern
timer
preventing
it
from
affecting
multiple
targets
in
one
attack.
Jungling
Shyvana
is
one
of
the
fastest
junglers,
having
great
clear
speed
and
mobility,
allowing
her
to
counter
jungling
exceptionally
well.
However,
her
lack
of
CC
diminishes
her
early
game
presence
and
is
more
focused
on
denying
the
enemy
jungler.
Consider
picking
up
a
Wriggle's
Lantern
for
extended
survivability
and
a
Frozen
Mallet
to
make
your
ganks
more
effective.

Countering
While
Shyvana
is
auto-attack
reliant
and
is
likely
to
build
attack
damage
items,
Shyvana's
Burnout
deals
magic
damage
,
which
scales
off
bonus
attack
damage
,
and
the
on-hit
effect
of
Flame
Breath
deals
magic
damage
based
off
the
target's
maximum
health
-
this
gives
Shyvana
high
mixed
damage
that
is
difficult
to
itemize
against.
Overall,
it
is
better
to
build
magic
resistance
over
health
and
armor
to
counteract
her
kit's
magic
damage
,
though
attack
speed
slowing
items
such
as
Frozen
Heart
and
Randuin's
Omen
may
help
to
lower
her
damage
output
considerably.
If
you
notice
Shyvana
using
her
Dragon's
Descent
,
move
away
from
the
spell
path
to
avoid
it
damaging
you
-
at
full
range,
it
will
take
her
1.3
seconds
to
reach
you
so
you
usually
can
hope
to
dodge
it
from
a
long
distance.
If
you
have
stun,
silence,
snare,
knock-back
or
knock-up
abilities,
use
them
quickly
on
Shyvana
when
she
casts
Dragon's
Descent
to
stop
her
mid-flight.
Shyvana
has
a
lot
of
potential
for
AoE
damage
while
using
Dragon's
Descent
.
However,
Twin
Bite
and
Flame
Breath
strike
in
front
of
her,
so
splitting
apart
to
make
Shyvana
unable
to
face
as
much
of
your
team
at
once
will
reduce
the
effectiveness
of
Twin
Bite
and
Flame
Breath
.
Take
note
if
Shyvana's
fury
bar
is
full
while
you
are
attempting
to
kill
her.
The
long
range
of
Dragon's
Descent
can
easily
allow
her
to
go
over
walls
even
while
a
fair
distance
away
from
them,
so
avoid
wasting
abilities
with
significant
cooldowns
and
costs
on
her.
Dragon's
Descent
is
not
limited
by
cooldown
-
quickly
gaining
fury
allows
her
ultimate
to
be
ready
long
before
yours
if
you
misuse
it.
Dragon's
Descent
requires
fury
,
which
is
quickly
gained
by
Shyvana
auto-attacking.
This
time
period
is
a
good
opportunity
to
harass
her
from
range
and
delay
her
ultimate.
Shyvana
shines
in
an
extended
close-combat
fight
over
time.
Use
champions
with
many
options
to
disengage
and
do
your
best
to
avoid
such
a
fight
against
her.
Shyvana
has
no
natural
ways
to
keep
you
in
place
for
her
to
auto-attack
you.
After
using
Dragon's
Descent
,
she
has
little
ability
to
catch
up
if
crowd-controlled
out
of
melee-range.
Using
crowd-control
effects
to
hinder
her
movement
during
Burnout
can
also
stop
her
from
getting
the
ability
to
its
maximum
duration
or
damage.
Burnout
provides
a
very
large
amount
of
bonus
movement
speed
at
the
beginning
of
the
ability,
which
decreases
a
bit
in
effectiveness
over
time.
Try
to
avoid
using
skillshots
against
Shyvana
until
after
she
casts
Burnout
,
as
the
movement
speed
boost,
especially
at
the
ability's
initial
use,
can
allow
her
to
easily
dodge
them.
Shyvana
tends
to
jungle
and
normally,
Shyvana's
jungle
route
starts
at
red.
Thus,
considering
stealing
her
blue
is
a
likely
safe
method
to
take
experience
away
her
early
jungle
and
to
prevent
any
enemies
from
having
it.
In
her
dragon
form,
Shyvana
is
more
powerful
than
during
her
human
form.
Her
passive
during
her
ultimate
is
doubled,
therefore
it
is
recommended
to
buy
armor
penetration
or
spell
penetration
items.
Keep
your
allies
spread
to
avoid
her
Twin
Bite
and
Flame
Breath
as
the
spells
are
turned
into
AoE
spells.
Beware
overextending
into
tense
situations
to
chase
her
in
her
dragon
form.
Burnout
increases
her
movement
speed
to
make
catching
her
difficult
and
leaves
a
fiery
trail
that
can
deal
significant
damage
if
you
do
not
avoid
it.
Following
the
burning
trail
allows
you
to
find
her
easily,
but
you
also
take
DoT
-
if
you
and
Shyvana
are
both
fairly
weakened,
underestimating
the
DoT
can
firmly
put
the
tide
in
her
favor.
Shyvana
lacks
any
gap
hard
gap
closers
across
from
her
ultimate,
Dragon's
Descent
and
she
is
highly
dependent
on
her
movement
speed
with
Burnout
to
get
into
range
into
the
enemy.
As
such,
ranged
top
laners
with
good
kiting
mechanics
such
as
Teemo
,
Kennen
,
Jayce
,
Nidalee
,
Ryze
,
Lulu
,
and
Kayle
can
easily
zone
Shyvana
out
and
can
harass
and
farm
safely
in
a
distance.
Keep
in
note
that
Shyvana
is
one
of
the
few
bruisers
that
do
not
use
mana
as
a
resource
and
can
easily
build
life
steal
items
such
as
Ravenous
Hydra
,
Blade
of
the
Ruined
King
,
and
The
Bloodthirster
to
sustain
herself
in
lane
longer,
so
build
accordingly
to
counter
her.
