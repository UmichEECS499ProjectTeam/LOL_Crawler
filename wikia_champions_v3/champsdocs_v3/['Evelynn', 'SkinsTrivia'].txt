Trivia
Evelynn
was
designed
by
Guinsoo
.
During
the
Beta,
Evelynn
was
voiced
by
Lea
Gulino
.
Her
current
voice
actress
is
uncredited
and
anonymous
to
the
public.
She
shares
this
voice
actress
with
Syndra
.
Evelynn's
dance
is
from
the
movie
Flashdance,
performed
to
the
song
Manhunt
.
A
side-by-side
comparison
can
be
seen
here
.
If
Evelynn
is
seen
by
an
enemy
champion
they
will
have
an
Exclamation
point
which
was
made
famous
by
the
Metal
Gear
Solid
series.
The
developer
of
the
Stealth
rework
also
claimed
to
get
the
idea
of
the
rework
from
the
Metal
Gear
Solid
series.
The
reason
why
Evelynn
does
not
have
quotes
of
her
own
from
the
altars
is
that
Riot
didn't
want
to
give
out
to
much
information
about
her
lore.
Kitae,
however,
confirmed
that
she
does
come
from
the
Shadow
Isles
.
[1]
Quotes
Evelynn's
quote:
"
I
like
it
when
they
scream
"
was
originally
made
for
Priscilla
the
Spider
Queen
[2]
.
Evelynn's
joke
is
a
direct
reference
to
a
quote
by
Evil
Ash
from
Evil
Dead
III:
Army
of
Darkness
.
Evelynn
shares
a
quote
with
Mordekaiser
and
the
western
altar
;
"Misery
loves
company."
In
addition,
this
quote
could
be
reference
to
Emily
Autumn
song
titled
same.
Evelynn
shares
a
quote
with
Thresh
,
Ezreal
,
Irelia
,
and
Annie
;
"This
way."
Evelynn
shares
the
same
quote
with
Mordekaiser
:
"If
I
must."
Evelynn
shares
a
quote
with
Ezreal
"All
too
easy."
Skins
Masquerade
Evelynn
is
likely
a
reference
to
the
roleplaying
game
Vampire:
The
Masquerade
.
The
skin
also
bears
similarities
to
Medusa
,
Queen
of
the
Inhumans,
from
Marvel
Comics
.
Evelynn
shares
a
Tango
skin
with
Twisted
Fate
.
In
the
Chinese
art,
the
only
difference
is
the
position
of
the
spotlight.
Lore
relations
Evelynn
and
Twisted
Fate
were
the
first
reported
couple
on
The
Journal
of
Justice
Issue
1
.
However,
Evelynn
reportedly
ended
the
relationship
in
Issue
10
.
