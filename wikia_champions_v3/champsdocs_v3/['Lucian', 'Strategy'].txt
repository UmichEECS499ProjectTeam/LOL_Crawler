Skill

Autoattacking
between
your
skills,
proccing
Lightslinger
,
is
an
efficient
way
to
boost
your
damage.
Piercing
Light
can
hit
target
out
of
its
cast
range,
cast
it
on
minions
to
damage
enemies
behind.
However,
beware
that
it
has
a
~0.35
sec
delay,
during
which
the
target
may
dodge
it.
Try
not
to
spam
this
ability,
the
short
cooldown
makes
it
tempting,
but
the
high
mana
cost
is
severe.
Missing
one
once
a
minute
or
two
is
acceptable,
but
can
get
unmanageable
if
you
have
a
bad
aim/your
opponent
can
avoid
it.
Lucian
is
a
high-burst
based
marksman;
a
quick
combo
of
Piercing
Light
-
Lightslinger
-
Ardent
Blaze
-
Lightslinger
can
be
used
to
deal
massive
damage
to
someone
early
in
the
game.
Later
on,
The
Culling
can
be
used
if
your
target
slips
out
of
range
or
to
provide
even
more
sustained
damage.
Remember
that
Relentless
Pursuit
will
also
proc
Lightslinger
,
so
you
can
use
it
to
contribute
to
combos.
However
you
are
better
off
saving
it
for
The
Culling
allows
you
to
re-position
yourself
if
the
intended
target
moves
away,
not
to
mention
it
will
refresh
if
you
kill/assist
on
an
enemy's
death.
Ardent
Blaze
produces
a
flash
of
light
where
it
detonates,
which
reveals
nearby
area.
Use
it
to
check
bushes.
Additionally,
enemies
hit
will
be
left
sparkling
with
energy
for
a
few
moments,
revealing
their
position
a
little
longer.
A
smart
tactic
to
escape
is
to
use
Ardent
Blaze
into
your
enemy,
dash
away
with
Relentless
Pursuit
and
use
The
Culling
,
proccing
the
mark
from
Ardent
Blaze
and
accelerating
yourself.
Ardent
Blaze
's
damage
quickly
slips
off
as
the
ablity
is
usually
not
maxed
out,
the
range
is
long
and
the
mana
cost
is
fairly
low,
but
the
damage
is
simply
underwhelming.
By
levels
1-4
the
damage
is
actually
good
and
you
can
use
it
to
harrass
from
a
long
range
By
levels
4-10
it
completely
slips
off
and
offers
mediocre
damage.
Use
it
mainly
to
chase/last-hit
someone
or
to
proc
Lightslinger
.
The
damage
improves
by
levels
10-18
as
you
are
putting
points
into
and
your
AD
makes
it
scale
decently.
It
will
tickle
a
tank
or
a
fighter
but
hits
decently
against
a
mage
or
other
marks(wo)man.
Lightslinger
second
shot
is
performed
a
very
(very,
0.2)
short
delay
after
the
base-first
one,
but
if
you
move
away
Lucian
will
still
perform
the
attack
(
with
an
special
animation),
it
can
be
smart
to
blow
a
Piercing
Light
,
Lightslinger
and
Relentless
Pursuit
while
getting
away
with
the
full
damage.
You
may
need
some
practice
to
fully
utilize
Ardent
Blaze
's
cross
shaped
explosion.
It
will
hit
enemies
directly
behind
the
main
target
in
the
same
angle
as
the
projectile,
this
may
be
the
easiest
way
to
utilize
it.
Aiming
The
Culling
on
a
target
affected
by
the
Ardent
Blaze
buff
procs
it,
increasing
your
movement
speed
and
making
it
easier
to
keep
up
with
their
possible
dodging
maneuvers.
Relentless
Pursuit
will
clean
any
slow,
as
well
as
most
secondary
effect,
such
as
Wither
's
attack
speed
slow.
Try
to
save
it
in
when
battle
breaks
out,
as
it
is
your
only
choice
to
escape
besides
Flash,
if
losing
the
combat,
or
to
chase
the
fleeing
enemies.
Try
to
aim
The
Culling
in
a
straight
line
rather
than
diagonally,
this
will
make
it
easier
to
position
to
hit
the
target.
The
Culling
can
be
a
very
good
way
to
scare
off
enemies
attempting
to
turret
dive
you.
You
can
also
use
The
Culling
to
quickly
clear
minion
waves
when
your
turret
is
being
pushed,
allow
it
to
target
enemy
champions
if
they
attempt
to
take
it
down.
The
Culling
can
be
used
to
get
a
reset
on
Relentless
Pursuit
's
cooldown,
as
seen
in
Lucian's
Champion
Spotlight.
Build
usage
Although
The
Culling
scales
with
attack
speed
,
Lucian
benefits
more
from
attack
damage
,
due
to
Lightslinger
and
Piercing
Light
.
Keep
in
mind
that
the
active
of
Sword
of
the
Divine
does
not
work
together
with
The
Culling
.
Trinity
Force
is
an
overall
effective
way
to
boost
Lucian's
kit.
The
boosted
Zeal
stats
are
good
on
any
autoattack
reliant
champion.
The
Phage
component
gives
him
some
attack
damage
and
health
,
providing
damage
and
tankyness,
also
the
Rage
passive
effect
of
Phage
and
Trinity
Force
gives
him
huge
kiting
and
chasing
potential.
The
Sheen
component
gives
more
burst
potential
with
the
'Spellblade'
passive
while
also
giving
him
increased
mana
,
which
gives
more
spammability
to
his
spells.
Fitting
extremely
well
with
his
"bursty"
nature,
Trinity
Force
can
be
"rushed"
on
Lucian
Iceborn
Gauntlet
is
a
slightly
cheaper
alternative
when
still
seeking
the
'Spellblade'
passive
of
Sheen
and
also
provides
a
large
amount
of
both
mana
and
armor
and
some
cooldown
reduction
to
help
with
spamming
spells.
Although
the
'Spellblade'
passive
is
not
as
strong
on
Iceborn
Gauntlet
as
it
is
on
Trinity
Force
,
in
exchange
it
provides
a
significant
AoE
slow,
giving
Lucian
some
effective
CC
when
combined
with
the
short
cooldown
of
Piercing
Light
at
higher
ranks.
Runaan's
Hurricane
is
an
efficient
item
on
Lucian
,
because
of
the
large
attack
speed
bonus
it
gives,
along
with
it's
unique
passive.
When
Lightslinger
procs,
Lucian
will
fire
a
total
of
6
shots,
which
is
useful
for
wave-clearing,
meaning
that
there
won't
be
a
large
threat
of
your
lane
being
pushed.
Additionally,
the
bonus
attack
speed
it
gives
will
have
synergy
with
The
Culling
,
increasing
your
damage
output
by
a
fair
amount.
The
Bloodthirster
is
an
excellent
item
for
Lucian,
because
it
grants
him
a
hefty
amount
of
attack
damage
,
while
the
life
steal
it
offers
grants
Lucian
much
needed
sustain,
especially
with
Lightslinger
.
As
one
of
the
core
items
on
any
Marksman
build,
The
Bloodthirster
can
also
be
'rushed'
on
Lucian
,
Trinity
Force
however
might
be
a
better
pick
if
Lucian
is
not
taking
heavy
poke
early
on,
but
if
he
does,
the
lifesteal
path
of
The
Bloodthirster
could
be
a
better
option
Statikk
Shiv
is
a
good
item
for
Lucian
,
because
it
offers
attack
speed
,
critical
strike
and
movement
speed
.
It
should
be
also
noted
that
the
Statikk
Shiv
passive
will
stack
much
faster
by
procing
Lightslinger
,
as
each
shot
will
provide
another
stack,
building
it
twice
as
fast.
Blade
of
the
Ruined
King
is
effective
on
Lucian
,
granting
him
attack
damage
,
attack
speed
,
life
steal
.
It
is
worth
mentioning
that
Lightslinger
procs
both
the
life
steal
and
passive
that
Blade
of
the
Ruined
King
offers.
The
Brutalizer
can
be
a
good
way
to
improve
your
damage,
due
to
the
armor
penetration
while
providing
some
cooldown
reduction
,
and
its
two
upgrades
have
benefits.
The
Black
Cleaver
will
grant
a
boost
of
health
and
attack
damage,
and
its
shred
can
quickly
be
stacked
with
either
Lightslinger
procs
or
The
Culling
.
Youmuu's
Ghostblade
,
while
it
doesn't
give
as
much
attack
damage
as
a
The
Black
Cleaver
and
may
not
grant
the
%
armor
shred,
gives
a
useful
active
to
boost
The
Culling
,
giving
about
2
extra
shots
as
well
as
movement
speed,
making
it
easier
to
follow
the
target,
while
the
increased
flat
armor
penetration
makes
it
easier
to
kill
squishier
targets.
Last
Whisper
will
grant
a
good
boost
of
attack
damage
as
well
as
high
%
armor
penetration,
making
it
useful
against
targets
with
lot
of
armor
.

Countering
Early
game,
Lucian
's
passive
Lightslinger
grants
him
a
lot
trading
potential.
Try
to
avoid
getting
hit
when
he
has
the
effect
ready.
Dodging
Piercing
Light
during
the
0.35
second
delay,
with
fast
reactions
or
an
ability
like
Vayne
's
Tumble
,
is
a
good
way
to
lower
Lucian
's
damage
output.
Also,
try
to
not
stand
in
a
line
with
allied
minions
and
Lucian
,
as
it
denies
him
every
chance
to
line
up
a
shot.
Be
careful
when
you
are
hit
by
Ardent
Blaze
:
now
affected
by
the
spell's
mark,
Lucian
can
easily
engage
with
the
bonus
movement
speed
.
Lucian
's
only
real
escaping
ability
(besides
summoner
spells
like
Flash
)
is
Relentless
Pursuit
.
Try
to
gank
Lucian
a
short
time
after
he
uses
the
spell,
since
the
cooldown
gives
a
substantial
timeframe
in
which
he
is
vulnerable
to
ganks.
Remember
that
Relentless
Pursuit
will
clean
any
slow
on
Lucian
,
keep
that
in
mind
before
using
powerful
slows
such
as
Wither
or
Exhaust
.
Altough
The
Culling
's
damage
may
seem
to
be
terrifying,
moving
sideways
can
help
dodging
at
least
a
few
shots,
because
the
angle
of
fire
cannot
be
altered
once
chosen.
Alternatively,
using
any
form
of
hard
CC,
such
as
a
stun
will
cancel
it.
However,
a
silence
will
not
cancel
it.
The
extra
damage
on
minions
makes
running
behind
them
not
a
good
strategy
although
will
block
a
few
hits.
