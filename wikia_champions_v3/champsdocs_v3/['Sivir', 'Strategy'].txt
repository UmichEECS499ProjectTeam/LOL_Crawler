Skill
usage
During
the
laning
phase,
you
can
harass
enemy
champions
with
Boomerang
Blade
to
put
pressure
on
them.
Successful
hits
will
force
them
to
play
safer
and
get
zoned
out
.
However,
the
mana
cost
of
this
playstyle
is
extremely
high,
due
to
Sivir's
small
mana
pool.
This
makes
laning
with
Soraka
more
viable,
as
she
can
replenish
mana.
Additionally,
Boomerang
Blade
returns
to
her
after
reaching
the
max
range,
so
you
can
move
your
own
position
to
hit
enemies
who
would
otherwise
have
evaded
it.
Boomerang
Blade
also
reaches
a
little
farther
than
what
the
range
indicator
shows.
Boomerang
Blade
can
be
used
to
check
for
enemy
champions
in
the
brush,
due
to
its
slicing
sound
when
it
hits
an
enemy
unit/champion.
As
Boomerang
Blade
deals
less
damage
with
each
enemy
hit,
try
to
hit
champions
without
hitting
minions.
A
good
strategy
is
to
wait
until
a
wave
clears,
or
when
they
are
running
in
a
straight
line.
Boomerang
Blade
tends
to
fall
off
somewhat
later
in
the
game
compared
to
Sivir's
autoattacks.
However,
it
is
still
useful
for
picking
off
enemies
after
a
team
fight.
Despite
being
a
champion
with
relatively
high
mana
costs
and
effective
lane
zoning,
Sivir
can
easily
and
effectively
be
adapted
to
play
in
an
aggressive
lane
with
supports
such
as
Thresh
and
Leona
with
a
few
simple
changes
to
mentality.
Use
Spell
Shield
to
bait
out
important
spells
from
your
enemies
before
you
engage,
OR
use
spell
shield
to
bait
an
engage
out
of
your
opponent.
Only
do
this
if
you
and
your
support
are
prepared
to
fight
to
the
death.
With
this
in
mind,
DO
NOT
mindlessly
waste
Spell
Shield.
Only
block
spells
if
you
need
mana
or
if
you
don't
fear
any
subsequent
spells
from
the
enemy.
Players
are
aware
of
Sivir's
need
to
regenerate
mana
with
her
Spell
Shield
and
may
bait
her
into
blocking
a
damage
spell
in
order
to
hard
engage
her
and
win
an
easy
kill.
Boomerang
Blade
is
a
zoning
tool
by
nature,
but
can
be
easily
wasted
if
you
only
use
it
for
this
purpose.
Instead,
conserve
mana
until
you
are
ready
to
hard-engage
the
enemy,
then
burst
down
your
target
with
a
mid-range
Boomerang
Blade
followed
immediately
by
one
Basic
Attack/Ricochet
reset
combo.
This
entire
combo
should
hit
before
the
Boomerang
blade
returns
to
deal
its
return
damage.
This
combo
allows
Sivir
to
compete
with
lane
bullies
and
bursty
carries
such
as
Lucian
in
a
hard
engage,
but
the
Boomerang
Blade
can
still
be
used
for
extreme
range
control
and
zoning
if
necessary.
Ricochet
is
a
cheap
tool
for
harassment.
Try
to
hit
enemy
champions
with
it
directly
after
an
auto
attack,
or
last
hit
creeps
with
a
Ricochet
when
the
enemy
is
close
to
the
wave.
Ricochet
also
resets
your
attack
timer,
which
means
you
can
use
it
immediately
after
you
auto-attack
to
get
a
"free
attack."
Getting
at
least
one
rank
of
Spell
Shield
early
is
very
helpful,
as
with
a
bit
of
practice
you
will
be
able
to
use
Spell
Shield
to
negate
spells.
With
experience
you
can
avoid
damage/crowd
control/death
and
recover
mana
in
the
process.
Spell
Shield
is
especially
strong
when
laning
against
mage
champions,
particularly
ones
with
delayed
damage
spells,
as
it
allows
you
to
regenerate
mana
fairly
often.
It
can
also
disrupt
combo-reliant
mages.
Spell
Shield
has
a
long
cooldown
when
it's
still
rank
1,
so
use
it
wisely
during
early
game.
When
using
Spell
Shield
to
regain
mana,
you
are
vulnerable
to
crowd
control
effects.
Spell
Shield
enables
Sivir
to
lane
mid
as
it
can
counter
most
spells
while
also
regenerating
Sivir's
mana.
The
movement
speed
bonuses
of
On
The
Hunt
work
very
well
on
meleeattacking-reliant
teammates.
Lacking
in
hard
CC,
Sivir
can
rely
on
Boomerang
Blade
and
Ricochet
to
deal
delayed
damage
and
prolong
Fleet
of
Foot
to
kite
her
enemies.
Given
enough
attack
damage,
Boomerang
Blade
and/or
Ricochet
can
quickly
kill
a
whole
wave
of
minions.
Build
usage
Using
Frozen
Mallet
or
Iceborn
Gauntlet
together
with
On
The
Hunt
keeps
your
targets
from
escaping.
These
items
are
also
effective
because
Sivir
has
no
natural
form
of
crowd
control.
Using
Boomerang
Blade
and
Ricochet
to
deal
delayed
damage
and
prolong
Fleet
of
Foot
synergizes
incredibly
well
with
Furor
.
The
armor-shred
passive
of
The
Black
Cleaver
is
triggered
by
not
only
auto-attacks,
but
on
any
effect
which
deals
physical
damage
such
as
Ricochet
and
Boomerang
Blade
(for
each
pass
through
an
enemy).
This
can
apply
max
armor-shred
stacks
very
rapidly
across
an
enemy
team.
Getting
a
Banshee's
Veil
will
allow
you
to
block
2
consecutive
spells
thanks
to
Spell
Shield
.
Be
aware
however
that
activating
Spell
Shield
while
Banshee's
Veil
is
up
will
cause
both
shields
to
pop
when
hit
by
an
ability.
Consider
buying
a
Sheen
based
item
on
Sivir
as
Ricochet
has
a
very
low
cooldown
and
applies
Sheen
proc
on
the
first
target
hit.
Trinity
Force
in
tandem
with
Phantom
Dancer
will
grant
massive
movement
speed,
attack
speed,
and
crit.
Coupled
with
a
Infinity
Edge
,
the
damage
from
just
autoattacking
while
hitting
Ricochet
can
put
out
massive
single
target
damage.
The
Bloodthirster
stacks
can
be
gained
easily,
thanks
to
Sivir's
high
farming
capabilities.
Some
ranged
AD
carry
champions
tend
to
rush
Infinity
Edge
,
however
The
Bloodthirster
will
provide
more
reliable
damage
on
Q-W
combos,
as
well
as
sustain.
An
early
Manamune
can
solve
mana
problems,
but
will
reduce
early
laning-phase
DPS
and
is
thus
ultimately
nearly
useless
due
to
your
Spell
Shield
generating
its
own
mana
when
it
is
used
up.

Countering
Sivir
is
fairly
squishy
in
the
lane.
Putting
a
pressure
on
her
can
make
her
underfarmed
or
underleveled.
Keep
in
mind
that
she
is
very
resilient
to
zone
because
of
her
Spell
Shield
,
and
being
too
aggressive
might
make
it
easier
for
her
to
land
Boomerang
Blade
.
Sivir
deals
entirely
physical
damage,
and
much
of
that
damage
is
dealt
through
autoattacks.
Consider
buying
armor
if
she
begins
to
deal
too
much
damage.
Avoid
taking
free
damage
from
her
Boomerang
Blade
,
by
moving
out
of
its
path.
If
you
can't
dodge
it,
staying
behind
your
minion
wave
will
mitigate
some
of
the
damage.
Also,
keep
in
mind
that
Boomerang
Blade
will
return
to
Sivir
after
reaching
its
max
range.
Being
at
it's
max
range
could
be
advantageous
in
that
it's
a
slow
projectile,
making
it
easier
to
dodge,
but
could
also
be
a
disadvantage
due
to
the
projectile
hitting
both
the
throw
and
return
strike
very
quickly.
Wait
until
Sivir's
Spell
Shield
is
on
cooldown
before
activating
your
high-damaging
spell.
Bait
her
into
using
it
by
acting
as
if
you're
going
to
cast
on
her,
but
don't
cast.
Sivir
is
often
very
attack
speed
oriented.
As
a
tank,
grabbing
a
Frozen
Heart
or
Randuin's
Omen
can
be
a
very
effective
counter
her,
and
champions
like
Malphite
and
Gragas
,
who
can
slow
attack
speed,
are
also
nice
counter-picks
to
her.
Although
Sivir
is
a
carry,
she
is
still
fairly
powerful
early
game.
Her
Boomerang
Blade
hits
hard
if
she
lands
both
portions
on
you
exclusively,
and
her
Ricochet
and
Spell
Shield
are
specialized
for
one-on-one
skirmishing.
Taking
her
head-on
without
heavy
armor
or
hit
points
can
result
in
a
long
trip
back
from
your
nexus.
