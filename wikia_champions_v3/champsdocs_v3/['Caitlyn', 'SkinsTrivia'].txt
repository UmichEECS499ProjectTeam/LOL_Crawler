Trivia
Caitlyn
was
designed
by
Ezreal
.
Caitlyn
was
the
first
champion
released
in
2011.
Caitlyn's
crime-fighting
partner
is
Vi
.
When
the
two
of
them
are
in
an
game
together
as
allies
they
get
a
cosmetic
buff:
"
On
The
Case:
Piltover's
finest
".
Where
both
get
an
additional
gold
for
every
kill/assist
they
make
together.
When
playing
against
an
enemy
Jinx
:
Causes
Caitlyn,
also
to
an
allied
Vi
if
she
is
present,
to
get
a
debuff
"
Catch
me
if
you
can!
".
The
debuff
reads
"Jinx
is
causing
chaos
again.
How
obnoxious...
Criminals
Apprehended:"
followed
by
a
counter
that
represents
the
number
of
Jinx
kills/assists.
+1
bonus
gold
for
every
criminal
they
apprehend.
Caitlyn
is,
along
with
Lissandra
,
Rumble
,
Varus
,
Vi
,
Xerath
,
and
Ziggs
,
one
of
the
few
champions
that
can
CC
themselves.
Caitlyn
is
the
most
frequently-picked
champion,
followed
by
Lee
Sin
,
Ezreal
,
Leona
,
and
Vayne
.
Caitlyn's
rifle
can
be
seen
in
the
Mac
Version
Launch
Video
for
League
of
Legends.
One
of
Caitlyn's
Yordle
Snap
Trap
can
also
be
seen
shortly
after.
Both
the
icon
for
Yordle
Snap
Trap
and
the
actual
placed
traps
appear
to
be
bear
traps
baited
with
a
cupcake.
Because
of
this,
many
players
refer
to
her
traps
simply
as
"cupcakes."
Likely
as
a
reference
to
this,
Vi
uses
"Cupcake"
as
a
nickname
for
Caitlyn
in
some
of
her
special
quotes.
Caitlyn
has
the
longest
Attack
Range
out
of
all
Champions,
650
range.
Tristana
may
have
longer
range,
but
only
with
the
help
of
Tristana's
Draw
a
Bead
.
Quotes
Caitlyn's
"Meet
the
long
gun
of
the
law"
quote
is
a
pun
on
the
phrase
"Long
Arm
of
the
Law"
.
Caitlyn's
quote
"Wanna
see
a
hat
trick?"
is
a
double
entendre
referring
to
the
magic
hat-trick
which
is
producing
an
object
out
of
an
seemingly
empty
top
hat
(similar
to
the
one
Caitlyn
wears)
and
the
sports
term
hat
trick
-
doing
a
triple-feat
in
any
sport
e.g.
triple-kill
in
League
of
Legends
,
three
touchdowns,
three
goals,
etc.
Caitlyn's
"Boom.
Headshot."
quote
is
a
reference
to
the
mockumentary
Pure
Pwnage
episode
"M8's,"
which
is
also
referenced
by
the
Team
Fortress
2
"Meet
the
Sniper"
video,
in
which
the
eponymous
class/character
says
it
while
tapping
a
bobblehead.
This
quote
could
also
be
derived
from
the
classic
N64
game
"Conker's
Bad
Fur
Day"
In
Polish
client,
Caitlyn's
"Bądź
czujny
jak
pies
podwójny"
(
"Be
open-eyed,
as
the
doubledog"
)
is
a
reference
to
stand-up
of
Kabaret
Moralnego
Niepokoju
-
Wyrywanie
Lachonów.
Skins
Safari
Caitlyn
skin
is
a
reference
to
not
only
to
(African)
safaris
,
but
also
to
the
web
browser
Safari
.
She
shares
the
internet
browsers
theme
with
Explorer
Ezreal
,
Chrome
Rammus
,
and
Foxfire
Ahri
.
Resistance
Caitlyn
skin
looks
similar
to
Natasha
Volkova
,
a
soviet
commando
from
the
Command
&
Conquer:
Red
Alert
3
video
game.
Arctic
Warfare
Caitlyn
skin
might
be
a
reference
to
the
Arctic
Warfare
series
of
sniper
rifles
by
Accuracy
International.
The
skin
was
a
special
gift
for
those
who
bought
the
PC
Gamer
US
November
2011
Issue
in
September
2011.
The
skin
was
later
made
avalible
for
everyone
to
purchase
on
December
29,
2011
More
clearly,
this
skin
is
an
homage
to
the
legendary
Finnish
sniper
Simo
Häyhä,
who
killed
505
Russian
soldiers
and
officers
over
a
span
of
100
days
during
the
Russian
invasion
of
Finland
in
the
winter
of
1939-1940.
Simo
has
the
highest
number
of
confirmed
kills
of
any
sniper
in
any
major
war
in
history.
Classic
Caitlyn
skin
resembles
Mad
Moxxi
from
the
Borderlands
series.
Relations
The
Hermit
of
the
Howling
Abyss
knew
Caitlyn's
mother.
Caitlyn
is
partners
with
Vi
in
the
Piltover
Sheriff's
Department.
The
two
have
been
chasing
after
Jinx
,
a
dangerous
criminal
who
has
been
causing
serious
problems
in
Piltover
for
apparently
no
reason.
