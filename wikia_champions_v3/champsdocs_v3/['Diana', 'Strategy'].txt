Skill
Usage
Landing
Crescent
Strike
is
important,
but
don't
be
afraid
to
miss.
The
cooldown
is
short
and
the
mana
cost
is
low.
You
must
be
able
to
accurately
predict
your
opponent's
movement
to
land
Crescent
Strike
.
Since
it
is
a
curved
skillshot
it
has
the
potential
to
go
around
them
and
miss
them
altogether.
You
can
also
use
the
curve
of
Crescent
Strike
to
your
advantage,
forcing
enemy
champions
to
move
inside
or
outside
of
the
curve.
Sometimes
people
may
try
to
dodge
Crescent
Strike
as
if
it
is
straight,
and
get
hit
instead.
Use
Moonfall
to
disrupt
channeled
abilities
such
as
Drain
,
Crowstorm
,
Meditate
,
Bullet
Time
,
Absolute
Zero
,
Death
Lotus
and
Requiem
.
Use
Lunar
Rush
and
Moonfall
to
stay
on
targets
and
activate
for
extra
damage.
The
time
it
takes
for
Crescent
Strike
to
reach
your
target
at
max
range
is
the
same
time
Lunar
Rush
takes
to
reach
so
if
you
cast
Crescent
Strike
into
Lunar
Rush
you
will
get
the
cooldown
refresh
immediately.
When
timed
correctly
Lunar
Rush
can
be
used
to
avoid
skill
shots
such
as
Enchanted
Crystal
Arrow
,
Final
Spark
,
and
Trueshot
Barrage
.
Diana
is
extremely
agile
in
the
jungle
due
to
the
synergy
of
Crescent
Strike
and
Lunar
Rush
.
Use
them
in
conjunction
to
traverse
the
map
quickly
or
to
escape
enemies.
Consider
when
to
cast
Lunar
Rush
without
Moonlight
and
when
to
wait
for
another
Crescent
Strike
.
Pale
Cascade
can
be
used
in
conjunction
with
Lunar
Rush
to
deal
extra
damage
and
also
refresh
your
shield.
Lunar
Rush
ignores
unit
collision,
so
Pale
Cascade
will
not
activate
until
your
target
tries
to
run.
If
chasing
an
enemy
champion
that
is
just
out
of
Lunar
Rush
's
range,
try
using
Crescent
Strike
on
a
nearby
minion,
use
Lunar
Rush
on
the
minion,
then
Lunar
Rush
to
your
target.
Build
Usage
Diana's
passive,
Moonsilver
Blade
,
activates
every
third
strike,
which
means
that
building
attack
speed
items
on
her
may
greatly
increase
your
sustained
AoE
damage
output.
Nashor's
Tooth
is
a
particularly
good
item
for
this,
as
it
gives
+50%
attack
speed,
20%
cooldown
reduction
,
and
+60
ability
power
.
Lich
Bane
works
very
well
on
Diana
due
to
her
low
cooldown
on
Crescent
Strike
and
her
ability
to
quickly
close
the
distance
with
Lunar
Rush
,
and
will
give
a
major
boost
to
your
burst
damage
provided
you
have
built
enough
AP
items.
The
extra
movement
speed
will
also
allow
you
to
stick
to
your
target
better.
Since
Diana
is
a
melee
assassin
building
survivability
items
will
be
necessary,
especially
since
she
often
needs
to
jump
into
the
middle
of
a
fight
to
kill
high
priority
enemies.
Even
when
building
for
survivability,
make
sure
to
buy
items
which
also
offer
ability
power
to
maximize
damage
output.
Abyssal
Scepter
will
give
a
good
boost
to
your
magic
resistance,
whilst
Zhonya's
Hourglass
should
be
built
when
the
enemy
teams
deals
a
lot
of
physical
damage.
Finally,
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
gives
substantial
health
and
a
useful
slowing
effect.
Although
Diana
can
become
deceptively
durable
with
a
Will
of
the
Ancients
due
to
the
low
cooldown
of
her
damaging
abilities,
most
of
it
is
AOE,
which
greatly
reduces
the
amount
of
spell
vamp.
Purchasing
a
Catalyst
the
Protector
early
can
effectively
keep
Diana's
health
and
mana
at
acceptable
levels
(without
buffs)
while
in
the
jungle.

Pale

Avoid
Diana
and
engage
her
after
the
shield
dissipates.
Diana
can
play
very
aggressively
if
she
uses
Lunar
Rush
without
Moonlight,
but
you
can
punish
her
by
slowing
or
stunning
her
when
she
has
no
way
to
get
back
into
position.
Diana
is
able
to
kill
squishy
characters
easily,
even
under
a
turret
due
to
her
shield.
Spending
on
an
early
Hexdrinker
is
a
good
option
for
all
AD
carries
to
build
which
can
later
be
changed
in
a
Maw
of
Malmortius
.
