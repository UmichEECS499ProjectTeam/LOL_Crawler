Trivia
Skill
usage
The
long
range
of
Lux's
abilities
allow
her
to
zone
and
generally
counter
short-ranged
champions.
If
you
hit
an
enemy
with
Light
Binding
,
throw
a
Lucent
Singularity
but
do
not
detonate
it
until
you
land
an
autoattack.
This
will
allow
you
to
ignite
two
Illumination
charges
for
extra
damage.
Lux
can
be
deceptively
durable
using
Prismatic
Barrier
.
This
allows
her
to
stay
alive
in
team
fights
much
longer
than
expected.
Use
Prismatic
Barrier
in
teamfights,
granting
your
entire
team
a
strong
absorption
shield.
On
cast,
Prismatic
Barrier
will
instantly
cast
the
shield
on
you,
and
when
the
rod
returns
it
resets
the
shield
on
yourself.
When
running,
cast
Prismatic
Barrier
in
the
direction
you
are
running.
This
way,
you
will
be
shielded
twice,
faster.
Lucent
Singularity
provides
sight.
Use
it
to
check
bushes
or
gank
spots
before
approaching
to
prevent
an
unnecessary
death.
Lucent
Singularity
can
also
be
used
to
check
Dragon
or
Baron
Nashor
.
Use
Lucent
Singularity
then
auto
attack
,
then
while
your
auto
attack
is
in
the
air
detonate
the
spell.
That
way
you
can
get
the
Illumination
passive
to
detonate
right
after.
The
combination
of
the
long
range
slow
of
Lucent
Singularity
and
Final
Spark
can
decimate
fleeing
enemies.
Using
Final
Spark
to
hit
enemies
who
are
attempting
to
Dragon
or
Baron
Nashor
may
allow
you
to
scare
them
or
even
kill
steal
the
Dragon
kill
or
the
Baron
buff.
Similarly,
it
can
be
used
to
finish
off
the
monster
when
your
team
is
attempting
the
kill.
If
Lux
is
used
on
the
map
Twisted
Treeline
,
her
ability
Final
Spark
from
the
middle
brush
can
target
enemies
at
the
tower.
This
gives
Lux
and
her
team
an
advantage
in
lane
control.
It
is
advised
for
Lux
not
to
get
into
a
close-up
fight,
as
her
low
movement
speed,
long
cooldowns,
and
relative
fragility
will
work
against
her.
Stay
behind
your
teammates
and
spam
spells
into
fights
from
afar
to
stay
out
of
harm's
way.
Lux
benefits
from
cooldown
reduction
more
than
most
champions,
as
her
spells
are
on
a
longer
cooldown
than
most
caster
champions.
Try
obtaining
the
Ancient
Golem
buff
to
use
Final
Spark
as
an
effective
poke
ability.
Having
a
strong
map
control
or
Clairvoyance
is
an
effective
way
to
see
enemies
in
the
fog
of
war
,
allowing
for
well
placed/timed
Final
Spark
on
low
health
enemies
or
epic
monsters.
Final
Spark
is
great
for
clearing
large
amounts
of
creeps
in
a
lane,
and
harassment
in
lategame
due
to
its
ridiculously
short
cooldown.
Feel
free
to
use
Final
Spark
just
to
shave
off
some
of
your
opponents'
HP,
due
to
its
low
cooldown
and
high
damage
output.
At
40%
cooldown
reduction
Lux
can
perform
it
every
30
seconds
,
which
is
so
low
that
she
can
use
it
to
soften
up
enemies
in
a
teamfight
and
then
finish
off
any
escaping
opponent
The
damage
of
her
ultimate
Final
Spark
extends
slightly
past
the
targeting
icon,
but
enemies
will
likely
dodge
it
if
they
are
at
the
very
edge.
The
most
common
damage
dealing
combo
that
Lux
can
use
is
(
Light
Binding
>
auto
attack
>
Lucent
Singularity
>
Final
Spark
>
autoattack)
Lux
can
easily
punish
enemies
who
overextend
or
chase
her
down
by
kiting
as
it's
easy
to
have
them
go
through
your
Lucent
Singularity
especially
in
the
jungle,
will
make
it
easy
for
you
to
use
Light
Binding
and
your
Final
Spark
right
after
for
damage
which
will
either
scare
them
off,
finish
them,
or
burst
down
their
hp
enough
for
your
team
to
finish
them.
It
is
stronly
suggested
to
use
smart
cast
as
Lux
requires
fast
initiation
of
spells
to
pull
of
her
whole
combo.
Do
not
neglect
her
passive
Illumination
at
any
level.
Lux
has
rather
low
ability
power
ratio's
for
a
mage,
but
an
extremely
powerful
level
scaling
on
her
passive
that
is
updated
every
level.
In
comparison,
if
you
were
to
fire
off
a
Final
Spark
at
level
11
with
a
Rabadon's
Deathcap
,
the
bonus
damage
on
your
ultimate
and
the
bonus
damage
from
your
passive
would
be
roughly
the
same.
Spacing
your
abilities
apart
and
weaving
in
auto-attacks
between
each
of
your
damaging
abilities
will
drastically
increase
your
damage
at
all
levels.
Build
usage
Lux
is
a
burst
mage
with
a
fair
amount
of
team
utility.
For
optimal
utility,
build
ability
power
and
cooldown
reduction,
coupled
with
enough
mana/mana
regen.
Ability
power
simply
improves
the
strength
of
all
of
Lux's
abilities.
The
primary
item
of
choice
for
this
is
Rabadon's
Deathcap
.
The
most
potent
damage
items
for
Lux
include
Rabadon's
Deathcap
,
Zhonya's
Hourglass
and
Liandry's
Torment
.
Flat
ability
power
increase
both
her
damage
and
utility
due
to
her
shield
scaling.
An
early
source
of
mana
regeneration
is
crucial
due
to
the
spammy
nature
of
her
abilities.
Chalice
of
Harmony
into
Athene's
Unholy
Grail
provides
mana
regen
into
late
game,
in
addition
to
a
large
chunk
of
cooldown
reduction.
Tear
of
the
Goddess
into
Archangel's
Staff
,
or
Catalyst
the
Protector
into
Rod
of
Ages
increases
both
your
mana
pool
and
survivability.
Athene's
is
the
most
efficient
choice
due
to
its
stats,
Archangel's
lacks
powerful
mana
regeneration,
and
Rod
of
Ages
should
be
incorporated
into
a
defensive
build
As
Archangel's
Staff
and
Rod
of
Ages
lack
cooldown
reduction,
they
can
be
coupled
with
a
Morellonomicon
.
Void
Staff
is
an
important
item
while
getting
to
the
later
phases
of
the
game.
Enemies
naturally
gain
magic
resist
as
they
level,
and
after
a
certain
point
they
are
able
to
brush
off
Lux's
attacks.
Penetration
helps
to
make
her
spells
hit
harder
and
closer
to
true
damage.
An
Elixir
of
Brilliance
is
a
great
way
to
cap
out
your
cooldown
reduction,
while
also
granting
a
fair
amount
for
ability
power
for
3
minutes.
It
is
worth
mentioning
that
getting
an
Elixir
of
Brilliance
is
not
always
a
good
idea.
Rapidly
getting
it
puts
your
gold
income
into
a
slope
and
delays
more
important
purchases

Countering
All
of
Lux's
spells
are
skillshots,
so
move
erratically
to
avoid
her
spells.
Avoiding
Lux's
Light
Binding
is
critical
for
your
survival
as
it
easier
for
her
to
land
her
full
combo
(
Light
Binding
»»
Lucent
Singularity
>
Final
Spark
)
on
you.
Remember
that
unlike
Dark
Binding
,
Light
Binding
will
snare
an
additional
enemy
behind
the
first
target.
Starting
with
Boots
of
Speed
will
can
help
you
dodge
skill
shots
by
moving
faster
away
or
out
of
them.
When
fleeing
with
low
health,
do
not
move
in
a
straight
line,
in
order
to
avoid
her
Final
Spark
.
Final
Spark
has
a
red
indicator
that
indicates
where
the
ability
is
cast,
even
in
fog
of
war.
Use
this
to
your
advantage.
Even
though
Final
Spark
has
a
long
but
limited
range,
the
spell
animation
is
nearly
instant,
unlike
Ezreal's
Trueshot
Barrage
.
Be
careful
when
you
have
the
Illumination
debuff
on
while
Lux
fires
Final
Spark
as
you
will
receive
both
the
damage
proc
from
the
Illumination
and
the
laser
itself.
Move
away
from
Lux
until
the
Illumination
debuff
wears
off
to
reduce
the
damage
you
will
take.
Do
not
run
in
a
straight
line
when
running
away
from
or
chasing
Lux
.
It
is
best
to
sidestep
to
avoid
her
Lucent
Singularity
or
Light
Binding
.
Prismatic
Barrier
does
not
do
any
damage,
thus
you
do
not
need
to
dodge
it.
However,
be
ready
to
dodge
Lux's
other
skills.
Due
to
the
small
and
narrow
paths
in
the
jungle,
Lux's
spells
become
more
than
likely
to
land,
enabling
her
to
fully
use
her
combo,
which
can
devastate
any
carries
or
squishies.
This
also
becomes
a
problem
/
advantage
in
team
fights
that
occur
in
these
areas.
Lux
can
easily
deal
massive
damage
to
enemies
who
stand
in
a
line.
Lux's
Prismatic
Barrier
is
also
more
than
likely
to
hit,
shielding
all
her
allies
which
will
cause
a
large
problem
/
advantage,
preventing
a
large
amount
of
DPS
dealt
to
her
team.
Lux
is
generally
countered
by
champions
that
can
survive
her
burst
and
chase
her/close
the
distance,
such
as
Wukong
.
Lux
is
a
skill
shot
based
champion.
Though
her
abilities
move
rather
quickly,
it
is
still
possible
to
dodge
them.
However,
Final
Spark
fires
instantly;
using
flash
to
escape
being
hit
by
this
may
be
necessary.
