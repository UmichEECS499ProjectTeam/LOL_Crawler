Skill
usage
Backstab
is
most
effective
after
using
Deceive
.
A
guaranteed
critical
strike
with
a
bonus
20%
damage
(not
a
true
critical),
then
quickly
followed
by
a
120%
damage
Two-Shiv
Poison
will
deal
a
reasonable
amount
of
damage
to
any
champion's
health.
Deceive
can
be
used
to
go
through
walls
in
a
similar
way
to
the
summoner
spell
Flash
,
so
it
can
help
you
make
a
clean
escape.
Unlike
Twitch's
Ambush
,
Deceive
allows
Shaco
to
enter
stealth
right
away
but
it
has
a
shorter
duration.
Be
aware
that
both
Jack
in
the
Boxes
and
Deceive
generate
a
puff
of
orange
smoke
when
used,
which
is
visible
to
the
enemy
even
if
used
in
a
bush
or
in
the
fog
of
war.
Having
at
least
1
rank
of
Jack
In
The
Box
is
important
for
team
fights
as
it
can
be
used
to
disable
many
enemies.
Stacking
multiple
Jack
in
the
Boxes
in
one
spot
can
rack
up
significant
damage
with
an
AP
build.
Warding
the
Jungle
and
surrounding
area
with
Jack
In
The
Box
can
allow
Shaco
to
see
a
gank
coming
and
escape
before
the
other
team
initiates.
Placing
them
in
the
brush
will
prevent
enemies
from
hiding
there.
Multiple
Jack
in
the
Boxes
strategically
placed
can
slow
or
trap
an
enemy.
The
Hallucinate
clone
can
be,
like
most
secondary
units,
controlled
by
pressing
Alt
+
doing
the
order
with
right-click.
It
does
not
use
any
abilities
or
activated
items
,
however.
Use
it
to
push
turrets
or
farm
minion
waves
once
the
duel/teamfight
is
over.
A
well-timed
Hallucinate
can
save
Shaco
from
getting
hit
by
projectiles.
This
works,
for
example,
against
turret
shots
and
certain
spells
such
as
Enchanted
Crystal
Arrow
or
even
Requiem
.
Using
Hallucinate
will
immediately
break
and
cancel
any
"leashed"
abilities
such
as
Ace
in
the
Hole
,
Soul
Shackles
,
or
Unspeakable
Horror
.
Casting
Hallucinate
will
not
break
stealth.
Sometimes
Shaco
is
best
played
tactically.
Start
off
with
a
point
in
Jack
In
The
Box
.
If
you
can,
sneak
into
your
lane
without
being
seen
by
enemies
and
get
to
your
bush.
When
in
your
bush
have
your
lane
partner
keep
the
enemies
away
from
the
bush.
Once
you've
placed
a
lot
of
Jack
In
The
Box
walk
out
of
the
bush
and
bait
your
enemies
into
a
bush.
Between
levels
1-4
this
should
be
an
easy
kill.
Keep
in
mind
that
experienced
players
will
be
wary
of
Jack
In
The
Box
in
bushes,
so
this
will
probably
not
work.
A
better
tactic
may
be
to
plant
them
in
an
enemy's
jungle
or
just
strictly
as
wards,
or
to
place
them
near
your
turret
to
make
defending
easier.
Shaco
has
a
number
of
differences
from
his
clone
that
reduce
its
effectiveness
against
observant
players.
He
can
be
distinguished
from
his
clone
in
the
following
ways:
his
clone
never
shows
a
neutral
buff
graphic,
pinging
Shaco
before
he
uses
Hallucinate
will
cause
the
ping
to
follow
the
real
Shaco
,
and
the
clone
wont
have
any
items
so
if
you
click
him
you'll
know
if
its
the
real
one
or
not,
at
last
if
he
Hallucinate
with
Trinity
Force
,
Lich
Bane
or
Sheen
you
are
able
to
tell
which
one
is
the
real
according
to
purple/red
glow.
Hallucinate
and
Deceive
can
remove
slows.
Deceive
will
not
increase
bonus
damage
applied
by
a
Trinity
Force
,
Lich
Bane
or
Sheen
proc.
When
laning,
having
a
teammate
with
Teleport
can
be
very
useful.
Placing
a
Jack
In
The
Box
in
a
bush
and
having
a
teammate
teleport
to
it
can
provide
a
fantastic
surprise
attack
that
the
other
team
wouldn't
be
able
to
call
MIA
quickly
enough.
Having
a
mid-laner
do
this
can
be
even
more
advantageous
due
to
the
level
difference.
Shaco
is
often
a
prime
target
in
team
fights.
You
should
be
using
this
to
your
advantage.
Coming
in
behind
the
enemies
and
posing
yourself
as
a
threat
will
cause
them
to
attack
you.
When
they
start
to
turn
to
you,
use
your
Jack
In
The
Box
to
fear
or
provide
another
target.
You
can
Deceive
once
they
start
to
pursue
you,
and
while
you
deceive
send
in
your
clone
for
additional
distraction.
All
this
will
allow
your
team
to
attack
with
less
counter
attack
since
enemies
will
be
focusing
on
you.
A
Banshee's
Veil
will
help
you
do
this
by
resisting
a
stun
or
silence
and
allow
you
to
Deceive
out
safely.
If
your
team
is
defending
a
turret
from
attack,
Shaco
can
push
another
lane
(split-pushing).
Shaco's
team
should
be
able
4-man
defend
a
turret
because
of
the
offensive
capability
of
the
turret
filling
in
for
Shaco,
and
an
AD
Shaco
can
take
turrets
down
very
quickly
with
his
Hallucinate
.
If
the
enemy
team
sends
a
few
champions
to
defend
the
turret
and
chase
you
down,
your
team
would
have
an
advantage
in
attacking
the
others.
If
the
entire
team
decides
to
target
you,
that
leaves
their
other
turrets
open
for
attack
by
your
team.
Jack
In
The
Box
can
be
used
as
an
anti-initiation
tool
against
champions
like
Evelynn
.
If
you
fear
that
they
may
initiate
on
you,
stand
on
top
of
a
Jack
In
The
Box
and
wait
for
them
to.
The
moment
they
do,
they
will
be
feared,
allowing
you
to
avoid
most
initial
damage
and
possibly
turn
the
fight
around.
Hallucinate
can
also
be
used
to
turret
dive
on
low
health
enemy
targets
hiding
under
their
turret.
When
recalling
(and
have
enough
mana):
Go
into
a
bush,
place
a
jack
in
the
box,
stand
on
top
of
it,
THEN
recall.
This
way,
if
people
are
looking
for
you,
they
won't
interrupt
the
recall
(unless
the
bush
is
warded
and
they
have
a
poke)
Build
usage
Shaco
is
primarily
built
with
attack
damage
and
attack
speed
,
due
to
his
assassin
style
gameplay.
Alternatively,
an
AP
-centered
build
is
also
possible,
but
relies
immensely
on
placement
of
Jack
In
The
Boxes
.
On-Hit
Items
such
as
Blade
of
the
Ruined
King
and
The
Black
Cleaver
will
increase
your
damage
greatly
as
your
Hallucinate
clone
will
trigger
their
passives
with
its
own
attacks.
(Stacking
effects
from
an
item
will
not
go
beyond
their
associated
cap.)
While
Sheen
does
give
bonus
damage
for
Deceive
be
aware
that
Shaco
's
clone
will
not
gain
the
particle
from
the
unique
passive
of
Sheen
,
making
it
easier
for
the
enemy
team
to
identify
the
real
Shaco
.
Cooldown
reduction
gives
Shaco
a
significant
boost,
allowing
you
to
plant
Jack
In
The
Box
faster,
create
clones
more
often,
and
use
Deceive
more
over
the
course
of
a
team
fight.
The
bonus
critical
strike
damage
from
Infinity
Edge
will
apply
on
critical
hits
from
Deceive
,
in
addition
to
the
bonus
damage
the
ability
gives.
Another
good
early
game
item
is
Wriggle's
Lantern
for
life
steal
and
attack
speed
when
building
an
AD
Shaco
.
Getting
an
early
B.
F.
Sword
can
greatly
increase
your
damage
output
due
to
the
increased
damage
from
Backstab
and
Deceive
.
The
Brutalizer
is
good
item
to
get
early
-
mid
game
as
the
armor
penetration
is
effective
against
squishy
champions.
Youmuu's
Ghostblade
,
which
builds
out
of
the
The
Brutalizer
,
is
an
ideal
early-mid
game
item
for
Shaco
,
affording
the
highest
flat
armour
penetration
in
the
game
(at
a
point
when
enemies
have
yet
to
stack
a
lot
of
armour,
particularly
the
squishies
most
in
need
of
being
shut
down)
on
top
of
every
other
offensive
stat
an
AA-dependant
champion
like
Shaco
could
desire
when
the
active
is
included.
Later,
it
can
be
swapped
out
for
The
Black
Cleaver
or
Last
Whisper
if
additional
armour
penetration
is
required.
Statikk
Shiv
has
a
unique
synergy
with
Shaco
,
as
Deceive
allows
him
to
get
a
guaranteed
crit
with
the
lightning
passive
at
the
beginning
of
an
engagement,
affording
him
an
extra
140-220
magic
damage
(depending
on
the
rank
of
Deceive
and
excluding
bonuses
from
crit
damage
sources
like
Infinity
Edge
)
at
the
beginning
of
his
burst,
as
well
as
giving
him
attack
speed
and
crit
chance,
which
he
likes,
and
building
out
of
the
Avarice
Blade
,
improving
its
affordability.
For
these
reasons,
it
is
often
rushed
in
a
lot
of
Shaco
builds.
Although
Berserker's
Greaves
are
probably
the
best
offensive
boot
choice
on
Shaco
due
to
his
dependence
on
auto-attacks,
do
not
overlook
the
fact
that,
as
a
melee
assassin,
he
is
exceptionally
vulnerable
to
crowd
control
.
Mercury's
Treads
may
often
prove
the
more
pragmatic
choice.
Boots
of
Mobility
are
also
viable
for
better
roaming,
though
bear
in
mind
that
Shaco
has
better
base
movement
speed
than
a
lot
of
champions
and
thus
may
not
need
them
as
much.

Stack
Jack
In
The
Box
es
to
take
the
first
Blue
golem
.
Jack
In
The
Box's
can
be
used
as
short
term
wards
in
the
jungle.
Shaco
can
counterjungle
well,
using
Jack
In
The
Box
es
to
kill
the
enemy
in
their
own
jungle
and
using
Deceive
to
escape.
•When
attacking
a
feared
jungle
monster,
it's
better
to
stand
behind
it
to
deal
the
bonus
damage
from
Backstab
Deceive
can
be
used
to
get
to
monster
camps
faster.
Use
Deceive
to
walk
past
where
wards
are
usually
placed
when
ganking.
Countering
Shaco
can
be
a
frustrating
champion
to
kill
due
to
the
quick
and
easy
escapes
with
Deceive
,
bringing
him
down
with
with
a
disable
or
a
fast
burst
will
make
him
a
much
easier
prey
Champions
that
can
detect
Shaco
during
his
Deceive
,
like
Lulu
,
Lee
Sin
,
Rengar
or
Twisted
Fate
will
make
him
very
easy
to
kill
,
as
Deceive
's
blink
is
pretty
short
ranged
Be
careful
when
Shaco
is
nowhere
to
be
seen,
he
might
surprise
you
with
his
Deceive
.
To
counter
this,
quickly
run
away
when
you
see
his
Deceive
particle.
Shaco's
Deceive
particle
can
be
seen
through
the
fog
of
war
and
in
bushes.
If
you
think
he
is
nearby
for
ganking,
be
on
the
lookout
for
it.
If
you
are
unsure
about
a
bush
be
very
careful
about
facechecking
as
he
might
have
filled
it
with
Jack
In
The
Box
.
Shaco
is
a
champion
who
stands
very
strong
early
game
and
is
know
for
his
deadly
ganks,
but
severely
falls
off
late
game,
apart
from
supports
almost
any
champion
with
a
similar
total
gold
will
be
able
to
defeat
him
without
suffering
too
much
damage.
Shaco
is
a
jungler
without
any
sustain,
as
such,
hurting
him
if
encountered
in
the
jungle
can
force
him
back
to
base,
as
well
as
a
bad
gank
can
do
the
same.
If
you
see
Shaco
initiate
a
fight
with
his
Deceive
,
quickly
focus
him
down
while
the
spell
is
still
on
cooldown.
When
fighting
Shaco
alone,
be
aware
that
he
might
use
his
Hallucinate
to
turn
the
fight
to
his
favor.
Also,
be
aware
that
he
can
dodge
any
projectile
or
casting
effect
when
he
casts
his
Hallucinate
.
To
easily
distinguish
the
clone
and
Shaco
,
his
clone
will
not
get
particles
from
any
actives,
buffs
or
passive
item
particles
such
as
Sheen
or
Youmuu's
Ghostblade
.
Shaco's
clone
can
not
use
abilities.
Keep
this
in
mind
when
you
are
trying
to
distinguish
between
the
real
one
and
the
clone.
When
he
casts
Hallucinate
,
his
clone
will
always
spawn
on
the
right
side
his
original
spot
and
face
backwards
while
the
real
one
spawns
on
the
front-right
of
his
original
spot
facing
forward.
Leona's
Zenith
Blade
will
only
apply
Sunlight
to
the
clone
and
Volibear's
Majestic
Roar
will
only
apply
the
fear
on
the
clone
while
the
real
Shaco
will
be
slowed.
Backstab
increases
any
of
his
damage
to
you
whenever
you
turn
your
back
from
him.
Be
careful
when
running
away
from
him.
