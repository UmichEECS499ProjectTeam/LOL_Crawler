Ability
Details
Death
Mark
is
a
single-targeted
dash
ability.
Applies
spell
effects
as
a
single
target
ability.
Spell
vamp
is
fully
applied.
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
will
apply
a
35%
slow.
Spell
shields
will
block
the
entire
application
of
the
mark,
including
Zed's
untargetability
and
dash,
but
it
will
not
block
the
detonation
of
a
mark
already
applied.
Additional
Information:
After
using
Death
Mark
Zed
can
blink
back
to
his
shadow
from
any
range.
If
Death
Mark's
damage
is
sufficient
in
killing
an
enemy,
a
shuriken
appears
above
the
marked
champion's
head
along
with
a
cloud
of
smoke
surrounding
them.
Death
Mark
can
be
removed
with
Quicksilver
.
Death
Mark
can
also
be
prevented
by
becoming
untargetable
before
Zed
strikes
you.
The
shadow
is
functionally
the
same
as
Living
Shadow
for
ability
casts.
A
third
shuriken
hitting
the
same
target
deals
50%
damage,
not
25%.
A
third
slash
hitting
the
same
target
applies
the
same
slow
as
two.
Magic
and
physical
damage
is
calculated
from
all
abilities,
items
and
buffs.
Damage
is
calculated
with
pre-mitigation
values.
[2]
True
damage
,
such
as
from
Ignite
,
is
not
counted.
If
the
target
dies
during
the
dash,
the
cooldown
is
reset
to
4-5
seconds.
If
this
happens,
Zed
will
leave
a
glitched
out
shadow
from
where
his
shadow
was
supposed
to
be
in
the
first
place.
This
shadow
will
remain
indefinitely
and
will
in
fact
mimic
all
of
Zed's
abilities
(so
he
can
have
up
to
four
shurikens
at
once).
He
cannot
switch
to
this
shadow,
however.
If
Zed's
Death
Mark
will
deal
enough
damage
to
kill
the
target,
a
swirling
shuriken
will
appear
above
the
target's
head.
If
the
target's
health
is
replenished
in
any
way
that
will
let
the
target
survive,
the
swirling
shuriken
mark
will
disappear.
The
red
mark
inside
the
target
that
denotes
the
mark's
existence
will
remain
for
the
full
three
seconds,
however
(unless
removed
by
means
of
Quicksilver
Sash
or
Mercurial
Scimitar
).
