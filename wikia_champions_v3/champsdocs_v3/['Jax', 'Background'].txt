It
is
seldom
the
case
where
a
champion
is
defined
by
his
actions
after
joining
the
League
of
Legends
rather
than
before.
Such
is
the
case
with
Jax,
for
whom
the
argument
could
be
made
that
he
is
the
most
prolific
tournament
fighter
currently
at
the
Institute
of
War
.
Before
joining
the
League
,
Jax
was
an
unremarkable
soldier-for-hire.
For
reasons
known
only
to
the
former
leader
of
the
League,
High
Councilor
Reginald
Ashram,
Jax
was
put
on
the
top
of
the
list
of
candidates
to
receive
a
League
Judgment
-
the
interview
process
that
either
accepts
or
rejects
a
prospective
champion.
His
Judgment
was
the
quickest
in
League
history,
where
the
Doors
of
Acceptance
glowed
and
slowly
swung
open
as
soon
as
it
began.
Jax
faced
no
recorded
Observation
or
Reflection
during
his
Judgment.
Jax
proved
himself
to
be
an
immediate
terror
in
the
Fields
of
Justice
.
The
self-proclaimed
Armsmaster
of
the
League
rattled
off
a
streak
of
consecutive
wins
that
to
this
day
has
not
been
matched.
A
number
of
summoners
in
the
League
grew
concerned
that
the
perceived
objectivity
of
the
League
of
Legends
would
be
questioned
by
the
presence
of
an
unknown
fighter
who
was
unbeatable.
For
this
reason,
the
new
leader
of
the
League
(following
Reginald
Ashram's
disappearance),
High
Councilor
Heyward
Relivash,
created
special
restrictions
for
Jax
to
fight
under.
This
was
something
the
League
had
never
done
before,
and
something
which
has
never
been
done
since.
The
burly
fighter
responded
by
imposing
his
own
special
conditions;
as
a
means
of
protest,
he
permitted
himself
to
fight
using
only
a
brass
lamppost.
Neither
the
League's
sanctions
nor
his
own
has
affected
his
winning
ways.
The
League
has
since
rescinded
its
sanctions,
but
Jax
has
not;
he
fights
and
fights
well
with
his
trusty
brass
lamppost.
"Be
advised
-
there
has
been
an
outbreak
of
lamppost-shaped
bruises
in
the
League
of
Legends."
―
Gragas
The
most
prolific
tournament
fighter
at
the
Institute
of
War
,
the
self-proclaimed
"Grandmaster
at
Arms"
rattled
off
a
streak
of
consecutive
wins
152
long.
No
one
had
ever
achieved
even
half
of
that
number
before,
but
what
made
it
even
more
remarkable
was
that
he
did
so
while
fighting
only
152
matches.
Concerned
the
peace
accords
that
ended
the
Rune
Wars
would
be
threatened
by
a
fighter
who
was
unbeatable
in
the
arena,
the
League
hastily
banned
Jax
from
the
arena
all
together.
But
in
the
spirit
of
the
Institute,
the
League
eventually
relented,
stating
that
a
champion’s
skill
was
no
reason
to
remove
a
realm’s
access
to
the
governing
powers
of
the
tournaments.
Jax
was
reinstated,
but
with
one
rule:
He
is
only
allowed
to
fight
with
weapons
the
League
deems
suitable.
For
now,
that
list
includes
a
lamppost,
a
chicken’s
foot,
a
spatula,
and
a
fishing
rod.

Nemesis
Jax
Announcement
made
by
NeeksNaman
:
[1]
There
are
times
when
a
champion’s
intimidating
visage
is
so
bloodcurdling
that
his
icy
stare
can
leave
an
enemy
quaking
in
his
Boots
of
Speed.
If
you’ve
been
on
the
lookout
for
a
truly
threatening
take
on
the
Grandmaster
at
Arms,
you’ll
be
pleased
to
know
that
Nemesis
Jax
is
armed
and
ready
to
leap
into
the
fray.
With
an
imposing
new
model
that
sports
a
steel
mask,
flowing
cape
and
wicked-looking
mace,
this
is
one
champion
your
enemies
won’t
want
to
face
top
lane.
