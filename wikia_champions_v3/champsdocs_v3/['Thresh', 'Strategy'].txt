Skill
usage
While
Damnation
lets
Thresh
continually
gain
power,
he
starts
off
weak.
Be
cautious
early
game.
Throwing
Dark
Passage
on
to
nearby
souls
can
let
you
collect
them
without
getting
close.
This
tactic
is
considered
very
useful
if
you
are
in
a
lane
against
champions
that
play
aggressive
early
in
game
(e.g
Darius
or
Renekton
)
or
champions
that
have
a
fair
amount
of
poking
abilities
(e.g
Lulu's
Glitterlance
,
Ezreal's
Mystic
Shot
and
Essence
Flux
or
Jayce
's
Shock
Blast
plus
Acceleration
Gate
combo).
When
considering
this
tactic,
Be
sure
you
have
enough
Mana
Regeneration
when
against
these
champions,
as
you
might
need
to
spam
Dark
Passage
quite
a
lot.
Flay's
passive
is
strong
enough
to
make
building
attack
damage
worthwhile.
Later
in
the
game,
when
you
have
collected
a
good
number
of
souls,
attack
speed
can
be
a
good
choice.
While
the
passive's
damage
scales
off
of
attack
damage,
it
is
still
magic
damage
,
and
will
benefit
from
magic
penetration
.
At
level
5,
with
no
attack
speed
bonus,
it
adds
~24%
of
your
attack
damage
per
attack.
Which
is
~20.5
at
level
18,
without
any
damage
bonuses.
(Pending
Testing).
It's
worth
saying
that
the
passive
effect
does
not
encourage
continual
attacking,
as
you
will
not
get
any
bonus
damage
if
you
do
not
let
the
ability
"charge".
Death
Sentence
is
a
great
initiation
tool.
Consider
the
merits
of
pulling
them
vs
pulling
yourself.
Keep
in
mind
that
it
can
also
be
cast
on
neutral
monsters.
This
can
be
used
to
escape,
set
up
jungle
ganks,
or
to
simply
increase
mobility.
Dark
Passage
is
a
great
way
to
save
an
ally.
Not
only
do
you
shield
them,
but
you
can
allow
them
to
escape
if
they
click
the
lantern.
Consider
teaming
up
with
melee
champions
who
have
dashes,
such
as
Xin
Zhao
or
Jax
.
They
can
jump
on
the
enemy,
be
shielded
from
counter
attacks,
and
jump
back
to
safety.
If
an
ally
is
coming
in
to
gank
your
lane,
you
can
place
the
lantern
in
his
path
and
initiate,
the
jungler/ally
can
use
the
lantern
to
jump
to
you
and
help
secure
the
kill
quickly.
Dark
Passage
can
be
a
good
scouting
tool,
particularly
when
checking
the
Baron
and
Dragon
pits.
However,
be
wary
of
the
ability's
long
cooldown.
Flay
is
a
good
escape
and
chase
tool,
depending
on
the
cast
direction.
If
you
catch
a
fleeing
enemy
with
Death
Sentence
immediately
use
your
Flay
to
push
them
further
towards
your
allies
or
turret,
securing
their
doom.
Also
useful
to
counter
enemy
leaps,
such
as
Leona
's
Zenith
Blade
.
If
an
enemy
is
camping
inside
The
Box
and
refuses
to
touch
one
of
the
walls,
consider
using
Flay
to
push
them
into
one.
The
slow
and
damage
will
be
worth
it
especially
if
you
Flay
them
in
a
helpful
direction.
(i.e.
towards
a
turret
or
allies)
Build
usage
With
abilities
that
scale
off
of
ability
power
and
attack
damage,
as
well
as
having
heavy
crowd
control,
Thresh
can
make
use
of
pretty
much
any
stat,
except
for
perhaps
critical
chance.
Let
him
adapt
to
changing
situations
and
match
ups.
Thresh's
ability
power
ratios
are
fairly
low,
and
gains
extra
on-hit
magic
damage,
making
magic
penetration
from
items
like
Abyssal
Scepter
a
valuable
stat.
Rabadon's
Deathcap
(or
Wooglet's
Witchcap
)
may
still
be
worthwhile
late
game,
since
it
will
multiply
his
passive
ability
power
gains,
but
only
if
you
have
a
lot
of
souls.
You
should
consider
Liandry's
Torment
for
the
%HP
damage
which
works
well
in
conjunction
with
Flay
.
Flay's
passive
component
has
great
damage
potential
and
can
be
combined
with
several
other
effects
for
devastating
results.
​Since
the
passive
multiplier
grows
between
attacks,
you
will
not
get
a
fully
multiplied
effect
building
both
attack
damage
and
attack
speed.
With
a
lot
of
souls
(at
least
100),
Nashor's
Tooth
,
Wit's
End
,
and
Runaan's
Hurricane
,
Thresh's
can
deal
very
good
DPS.
Nashor's
Tooth's
damage
will
also
be
increased
by
the
bonus
AP
from
Damnation
.
With
lot's
of
AD
and
time
to
wind
up
Thresh
can
deal
a
very
high
amount
of
damage
in
a
single
hit.
(up
to
450%
AD
if
using
the
Infinity
Edge
,
not
counting
the
souls
obtained)
Note
that
the
bonus
damage
is
magical,
and
as
such
it
will
not
crit.
Sword
of
the
Divine
can
help
ensure
you
crit.
​Thresh's
gap
closer,
crowd
control,
and
the
ability
for
allies
to
move
to
him
with
Dark
Passage
allow
him
to
be
a
great
initiator.
Consider
building
tank
and
aura
items
like
Frozen
Heart
,
Abyssal
Scepter
,
or
Locket
of
the
Iron
Solari
.
Locket
of
the
Iron
Solari
is
probably
the
best
item
when
playing
support
Thresh,
thank
to
the
fact
that
he
can
shield
the
whole
team
with
Dark
Passage
,
and
increase
magic
resistance
of
all
the
teammates.
Thresh's
effectiveness
in
several
roles
depends
very
much
on
the
number
of
soul
he
has
collected.
Under
100
souls,
your
armor
is
lower
than
that
of
the
most
champions.
Thus,
you
should
consider
buying
items
with
high
armor
values
or
play
defensive.
Between
100
and
200
souls,
you
can
consider
building
something
more
offensive
or
refocus
on
magic
resist
or
health
if
you
are
building
as
a
tank.
You
have
matched
the
armor
of
many
champions,
and
with
115
souls
you
surpass
Maokai
,
having
the
highest
armor
at
level
18
(passive
abilities,
such
as
Shatter
not
included).
Over
200
souls,
you
can
build
Rabadon's
Deathcap
and
Runaan's
Hurricane
and
start
becoming
a
full
offensive
champion,
because
you
have
162
base
armor
(surpassing
even
Taric
)
and
150
AP,
only
by
the
collected
souls.
You
can
also
add
a
Wit's
End
for
powerful
magic
resistance
reduction,
or
a
Nashor's
Tooth
to
this
build
for
adding
on-hit,
AP-based
magic
damage.
In
this
case,
you
should
take
some
magic
resist
and
health
item,
like
Banshee's
Veil
or
Spirit
Visage
.

Countering
Since
Thresh
receives
a
lot
of
his
power
through
Damnation
,
zoning
him
out
from
collecting
souls
is
especially
effective.
Take
into
account
your
own
creeps'
positions
as
these
are
where
souls
may
spawn.
Thresh
will
commonly
use
Dark
Passage
to
collect
souls.
It
can
be
a
good
idea
to
wait
until
Dark
Passage
goes
on
cooldown
before
going
on
the
offensive.
Remember,
every
death
leaves
Thresh
with
downtime
where
he
can't
collect
souls.
His
passive
can
be
his
downfall
if
successfully
utilized
against
him.
Thresh
has
high
offensive
capability,
but
only
in
a
relatively
close
range.
Thresh's
Death
Sentence
is
his
main
initiation
ability,
and
much
like
playing
against
other
aggressive
supports,
avoiding
it
will
limit
his
ability
to
get
on
top
of
you
and
unloading
his
combo.
Using
allied
minions
to
shield
yourself
can
be
effective,
but
note
that
Thresh
may
still
choose
to
pull
himself
anyway
to
get
in
range
for
his
other
spells.
Thresh
is
not
very
durable
early
on,
and
harassing
Thresh
will
make
it
risky
for
him
to
use
his
spells
effectively.
Use
these
opportunities
to
force
fights.
Be
aware
that
Dark
Passage
can
be
used
to
quickly
bring
one
of
Thresh's
allies
into
a
fight.
Try
to
gain
vision
of
areas
behind
Thresh
from
where
his
reinforcements
could
approach.
Dark
Passage
when
used
to
help
Thresh's
allies
escape
can
be
halted
by
placing
obstacles
(such
as
wards
or
pets)
and/or
moving
into
the
lantern
to
try
and
stop
enemy
champions
from
clicking
on
the
lantern
as
they
will
attack
the
obstacle
instead
of
activating
the
lantern.
As
of
Patch
3.11
you
can
now
Cleanse
the
stun,
break
the
chain,
and
prevent
Death
Leap
into
you
team
using
Mikael's
Crucible
on
a
hooked
ally.
It
can
be
self-cast.
