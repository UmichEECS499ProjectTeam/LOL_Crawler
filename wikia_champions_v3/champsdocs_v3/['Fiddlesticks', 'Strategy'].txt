Keep
in
mind
that
your
passive
Dread
will
be
seen
when
your
enemy
is
close
enough,
even
when
they
lack
vision
of
you.
This
can
occasionally
ruin
potential
ganks
in
which
the
enemy
gets
the
debuff
and
retreats,
so
make
sure
that
your
passive
is
out
of
range
until
you
engage.
Dread
is
very
useful
early
game.
If
you
are
laning
with
a
mage
or
caster,
this
will
allow
you
to
push
your
lane
much
better.
Terrify
with
Drain
is
an
amazing
combo
that
can
turn
the
tables
in
a
fight.
To
make
sure
that
the
enemy
stays
within
range,
Terrify
them
against
a
wall,
where
they
will
be
under
heavy
fire
and
under
control.
If
you
use
Drain
on
enemies
that
go
into
stealth
or
flash,
Fiddlesticks
won't
stop
channeling
until
they
go
out
of
range.
Drain
also
continues
through
Sanguine
Pool
,
Rebirth
and
Playful
.
In
early
game
lane,
Dark
Wind
is
an
extremely
effective
poke.
With
no
ability
power
runes
it
does
65
damage
a
bounce
with
no
reduction
in
damage
from
successive
bounces,
and
it
only
costs
50
mana.
Furthermore,
Dark
Wind
can
be
used
from
an
extremely
long
range
since
you
can
bounce
it
from
melee
minions
to
range
minions
to
the
target
character.
Even
at
closer
range
it
silences
so
you
can
escape
often
without
taking
damage.
Since
Dark
Wind
is
the
last
ability
you
should
level,
use
it
early
(levels
1-5)
and
often
to
give
you
a
lane
advantage.
At
middle
levels
(6-11)
this
ability
will
be
far
less
effective
at
poking
from
range
and
clearing
minions,
while
champions
with
long
range
pokes
will
stop
you
from
farming.
When
taking
down
opponents,
consider
using
him
as
an
assassin,
as
Fiddlesticks
shouldn't
take
on
many
champions
head-to-head.
Sneaking
up
on
an
enemy
champion
then
using
Crowstorm
,
Terrify
,
and
Drain
maximizes
damage.
Dark
Wind
is
most
useful
for
silencing
enemy
champions,
but
can
do
very
high
damage
to
bunched
up
enemy
champions
(especially
pairs
of
champions
with
no
minions
around
as
the
spell
will
bounce
between
them
until
it
reaches
5
bounces,
keeping
them
both
silenced
for
the
duration).
It
can
also
be
very
effective
for
farming
since
it
deals
50%
bonus
damage
to
minions.
You
can
also
initiate
a
fight
by
using
Flash
or
Crowstorm
over
a
wall
and
using
the
aforementioned
combo
onto
the
enemy
team.
Coordinate
with
your
teammates
when
you
use
Crowstorm
in
order
to
maximize
the
damage.
It
synergizes
well
with
abilities
which
provide
area
of
effect
crowd
control
.
Use
Dark
Wind
to
rack
up
minion
kills
and
try
to
use
Drain
primarily
on
siege
minions
to
get
the
maximum
health
gain.
Drain
allows
Fiddlesticks
to
jungle
by
almost
continuously
regaining
health.
With
his
Terrify
and
with
Dark
Wind
,
he
is
a
great
ganker
as
well
as
a
great
jungler.
Casting
other
abilities,
getting
silenced
or
getting
stunned
while
using
Drain
will
stop
channeling.
Flash
can
be
used
after
casting
Crowstorm
to
quickly
jump
into
an
enemy
or
group
of
enemies.
Two
blinks
are
twice
as
effective.
A
summoner
spell
that
can
be
used
to
escape,
such
as
Ghost
or
Flash
,
is
essentially
mandatory
on
Fiddlesticks
.
Crowstorm
does
not
make
you
invulnerable.
Be
careful
about
blinking
into
crowds
with
only
maximizing
damage
in
mind.
Items
like
Zhonya's
Hourglass
or
abilities
like
Idol
of
Durand
would
be
helpful.
Build
usage
Starting
items
for
Fiddlesticks
should
almost
always
include
some
form
of
mana
regen.
A
few
Mana
Potions
or
a
Doran's
Ring
will
allow
you
to
poke
constantly
and
keep
your
life
up
with
Drain
.
Zhonya's
Hourglass
is
a
must
have
on
Fiddlesticks.
It
gives
you
the
ability
to
very
effectively
tower
dive
or
initiate
team
fights
with
Crowstorm
or
block
the
massive
amounts
of
CC
and
incoming
damage
that
will
be
thrown
at
you
whenever
you
choose
to
Crowstorm
in.
It
is
often
best
to
rush
Zhonya's
Hourglass
since
Terrify
->
Drain
combo
will
give
you
plenty
of
sustain
while
Crowstorming
in
for
1v1
assassinations,
and
what
you
need
is
early
team
fight
sustain
since
you
often
have
to
get
into
the
frontline
to
deal
damage.
Buying
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
will
maximize
your
damage
with
Drain
,
as
your
enemy
is
slowed
when
trying
to
escape.
It
will
also
help
your
ultimate
by
maximizing
damage
and
adding
a
large
AoE
slow
in
team
fights,
giving
an
advantage
to
your
team.
Buying
a
Deathfire
Grasp
or
Liandry's
Torment
/
Blackfire
Torch
can
help
Fiddlesticks
deal
with
champions
with
high
health
.
If
you
are
being
targeted
by
the
enemy
team
during
Crowstorm
,
you
can
use
Zhonya's
Hourglass
to
avoid
taking
damage
without
ending
the
Area
of
Effect
effect
of
Crowstorm
.
Fiddlesticks
is
a
relatively
slow
jungler
and
it
can
be
hard
to
gank
until
you
reach
level
6
and
get
Crowstorm
.
Consider
buying
Boots
of
Mobility
/
Boots
of
Swiftness
to
help
switch
between
farming
while
your
Crowstorm
is
on
cooldown
and
ganking.
Abyssal
Scepter
can
synergize
with
his
passive
Dread
,
decreasing
enemies'
magic
resistance
by
up
to
30
MR.
Using
a
Banshee's
Veil
is
good
idea
for
more
survivability
and
so
the
channeling
of
your
ultimate
Crowstorm
will
not
be
interrupted
by
an
enemy
with
a
disruption
CC
ability.
A
Spirit
Visage
allows
Fiddlesticks
to
heal
a
lot
more
with
Drain
meaning
that
he
can
put
more
points
into
other
abilities
earlier
on.
Additionally,
spell
vamp
extremely
increases
the
healing
effectiveness
of
Drain
,
making
Will
of
the
Ancients
a
decent
item,
but
not
an
absolute
must-have.
Buying
Athene's
Unholy
Grail
will
provide
a
huge
amount
of
sustain
when
used
with
drain,
not
to
mention
cooldown
reduction
and
ability
power.
Jungling
If
the
enemy
team
has
a
strong
invader,
such
as
Blitzcrank
or
Alistar
,
consider
starting
with
Boots
of
Speed
,
Sight
Ward
and
a
Health
Potion
.
Placing
the
ward
at
either
your
blue,
or
the
enemy
team's
blue
before
the
jungle
camps
spawn,
can
give
your
team
valuable
information
on
where
the
enemy
jungler
is
starting
and
make
it
easier
for
you
to
steal
their
blue
if
they're
invading
your
side
of
the
jungle.
Starting
items:
Amplifying
Tome
or
Doran's
Ring
or
(
Boots
of
Speed
and
2
×
Health
Potion
and
a
Mana

Gank
/
Fountain
An
alternate
strategy
is
to
get
Terrify
at
level
2,
and
gank
a
lane.
Terrify
/
Drain
can
deal
significant
damage,
especially
if
your
opponents
have
not
hit
level
2.
Fiddlesticks
doesn't
necessarily
need
Smite
for
a
full
clear
due
to
his
health
regeneration
through
Drain
,
but
jungling
without
it
is
not
recommended
as
it
jeopardizes
buff
camps,
Dragon
and
Baron
Nashor.

Countering
Fiddlesticks
deals
most
of
his
damage
from
his
Drain
and
Crowstorm
and
both
have
channels
which
can
be
interrupted.
This
means
that
hard
CC,
like
a
stun,
can
stop
most
of
Fiddlesticks'
damage.
However,
Fiddlesticks
will
likely
disable
you
with
Terrify's
lengthy
fear
before
channeling,
making
a
teammate
invaluable.
A
common
Fiddlesticks
strategy
is
to
hide
in
the
brush,
wait
for
an
unaware
champion
to
appear,
and
use
his
Crowstorm
.
Good
warding
and
map
awareness
can
stop
Fiddlesticks
from
ganking
you
from
typical
locations.
If
you
notice
you
have
the
Dread
debuff,
but
you
can
not
see
Fiddlesticks,
he
is
probably
hiding
nearby
in
a
bush
or
behind
a
nearby
thin
wall.
Use
this
to
your
advantage.
When
starting
a
teamfight,
try
to
save
your
ability
with
CC
that
can
interrupt
channeling
abilities.
If
you
see
an
enemy
Fiddlesticks
channeling
his
Crowstorm
,
use
a
CC
ability
that
can
stop
him
(stun,
silence,
knockback,
knockup).
If
you
have
vision
of
Fiddlesticks,
Crowstorm
has
a
distinctive
"scratching"
noise
followed
by
a
"
tak
"
sound
while
channeling.
Alternatively,
his
pose
is
same
as
Drain
except
without
a
green
leash.
However,
the
time
window
is
fairly
narrow,
and
you
may
be
in
even
more
danger
of
taking
the
brunt
of
Crowstorm's
devastating
damage
if
you
are
trying
to
reach
Fiddlesticks.
Having
a
healing
reduction
like
Ignite
,
Executioner's
Calling
,
Morellonomicon
or
abilities
such
as
Impure
Shots
can
make
Drain
less
effective.
An
easy
way
to
counter
Fiddlesticks
is
to
purchase
Mercury's
Treads
to
reduce
the
duration
of
his
fear
or
a
Banshee's
Veil
to
negate
one
of
his
spell
and
reduce
his
damage
output.
