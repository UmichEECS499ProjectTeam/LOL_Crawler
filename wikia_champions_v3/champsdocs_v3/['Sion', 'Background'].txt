Background

&
Trivia
Lore
Prior
to
the
creation
of
the
League
of
Legends
,
the
city-states
of
Demacia
and
Noxus
were
locked
in
a
brutal
series
of
on-again-off-again
wars
that
spanned
the
course
of
centuries.
Both
powers
sought
an
advantage
over
the
other,
but
Noxus
was
the
city-state
willing
to
forego
conventional
morality
to
achieve
its
goals.
Only
brute
strength
and
the
will
to
use
it
mattered
to
Noxus,
and
this
is
best
exemplified
in
the
murderous
warrior,
Sion.
Used
by
the
Noxians
as
a
human
battering
ram,
Sion
would
be
sent
thundering
ahead
of
Noxian
troops.
He
would
mercilessly
slaughter
foes
with
his
large
double-bladed
axe,
"Chopper".
His
complete
disregard
for
caution
ultimately
cost
him
his
life,
as
he
was
captured
and
summarily
executed
by
Demacian
forces.
The
Demacians
thought
that
the
beheading
of
Sion
would
be
the
end
of
his
bloodthirsty
ways.
Death,
however,
was
merely
the
beginning
of
Sion's
rise
to
power.
The
famed
Noxian
assassin,
Katarina
,
recovered
Sion's
remains
and
Noxian
necromancers
reanimated
the
behemoth
to
serve
Noxus
once
again.
Sion's
reanimation
actually
bestowed
new
powers
on
him
and
increased
the
potency
of
his
existing
abilities,
making
him
even
more
of
a
terror
to
behold
on
the
battlefield.
The
Noxian
High
Command
had
a
powerful
new
weapon
in
their
hands
-
one
they
have
brought
to
bear
as
a
champion
in
the
League
of
Legends.
Even
though
Sion's
increased
powers
would
make
him
a
powerful
tool
for
the
High
Command's
use
outside
the
Fields
of
Justice
,
Noxus
no
longer
risks
losing
one
of
their
greatest
champions
in
the
League
to
chance
or
circumstance;
Sion's
days
as
a
front-line
fighter
for
Noxus'
military
conquests
are
at
an
end.
"For
Noxus,
death
is
a
promotion."
