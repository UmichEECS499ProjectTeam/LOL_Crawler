Lucian,
the
Purifier
is
a
champion
in
League
of
Legends
.
[1]
Abilities
Lightslinger
After
using
an
ability,
Lucian's
next
auto
attack
within
6
seconds
will
strike
twice.
The
second
shot
deals
50%
of
Lucian's
AD
,
but
fully
applies
on-hit
effects.
Minions
and
monsters
take
full
damage
from
the
second
shot.
The
second
shot
can
critically
strike.
If
the
target
is
killed
before
the
second
shot
can
go
off,
the
second
shot
will
automatically
shoot
at
something
else.
Ability
Details
Lightslinger
is
an
on-hit
effect
that
triggers
whenever
Lucian
uses
an
ability,
and
causes
him
to
attempt
to
complete
2
autoattacks
in
quick
succession.
The
first
attack,
respectively,
functions
as
the
trigger
of
Lightslinger
and
will
consume
the
empowerment.
Both
attacks
will
trigger
on-attack
effects
and
on-hit
effects
.
Note
however,
that
only
one
attack
will
consume
on-hit
effects
that
apply
only
for
a
single
hit
(for
example,
the
passive
of
Sheen
)
Both
attacks
are
classified
as
ranged
.
Critical
strike
chance
is
calculated
on
each
attack
individually.
The
second
attack's
critical
strike
will
deal
damage
based
on
50%
of
Lucian's
AD
.
Blind
and
Counter
Strike
mitigates
the
physical
damage
of
both
hits.
Aegis
Protection
and
Riposte
will
only
block
the
first
hit.
Spellblade
items
don't
interact
with
the
second
shot
as
they
are
almost
always
used
by
Lucian's
primary
attack,
and
due
to
their
internal
cooldown
they
are
not
up
in
time
for
the
second
shot.
Runaan's
Hurricane
will
trigger
on
both
attacks,
making
a
total
of
6
shots.
Spell
shields
have
no
effect.
Additional
Information:
If
the
target
dies
to
the
first
hit
of
Lightslinger,
the
second
shot
will
target
another
nearby
enemy
unit.
This
will
prioritise
enemy
champions,
and
minions
with
low
health.
Even
if
no
second
target
is
found,
the
Lightslinger
buff
is
still
consumed.
The
second
shot
can
target
enemies
that
are
hidden
in
the
fog
of
war
or
a
bush.
This
action
was
originally
a
bug,
but
was
properly
integrated
into
the
ability
in
V3.12
.

Additional
Information:
The
mark
can
be
removed
with
Quicksilver
.
Lucian
will
only
gain
bonus
movement
speed
from
damaging
an
enemy.

that
are

,
or

Active:
Lucian
dashes
a
short
distance
and
removes
all
slowing
effects.
Relentless
Pursuit's
cooldown
resets
if
Lucian
scores
a
kill
during
The
Culling.
Ability
Details
Relentless
Pursuit
is
a
linear
dash
.
Additional
Information:
The
cooldown
is
only
refreshed
if
Lucian
scores
a
kill
while
The
Culling
is
active.
Scoring
a
kill
with
The
Culling,
but
after
the
effect
has
ended,
will
not
refresh
the
cooldown.
Relentless
Pursuit
only
removes
slows
on-cast,
and
will
not
remove
any
slows
that
are
applied
during
the
dash.
Relentless
Pursuit
will
remove
any
and
all
slow
debuffs,
including
any
additional
effects
the
debuff
applies.
As
of
V3.13
,
all
attack
speed
reduction
is
treated
as
a
slow
and
will
also
be
removed.
As
Frozen
Heart
is
an
aura
it
is
not
removed
by
Relentless
Pursuit.
It
will
remove
"Chill",
preventing
Frostbite
from
dealing
double
damage.
Relentless
Pursuit
will
not
remove
the
additional
effects
if
the
two
parts
are
separate
debuffs.
For
example,
it
will
not
remove
the
damage
reduction
from
Exhaust
or
the
attack
damage
reductions
of
Mocking
Shout
and
Chomp
.
The
Culling
Range:
1400
Cooldown:
100
/
75
/

Cost:
100
mana
Active:
Lucian
starts
firing
shots
in
the
target
direction
for
3
seconds,
each
shot
dealing
physical
damage
to
the
first
enemy
it
hits.
The
number
of
shots
fired
scales
with
his
attack
speed.
The
Culling
deals
quadruple
damage
to
minions
but
not
monsters.
While
using
The
Culling,
Lucian's
basic
attacks
are
disabled
and
he
cannot
activate
Piercing
Light
or
Ardent
Blaze.
He
can,
however,
move
freely
and
activate
Relentless
Pursuit.
The
Culling
can
be
reactivated
to
end
the
effect
early
and
it
is
interrupted
by
crowd
control
effects
that
inhibit
basic
attacks.

Ability
Details
The
Culling
is
made
up
of
multiple
linear,
colliding
skill
shots
that
fire
at
a
fixed
angle
relative
to
the
map.
Applies
spell
effects
as
an
area
of
effect
ability.
Spell
vamp
is
reduced
to
one-third
effectiveness.
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
will
apply
a
15%
slow.
On-hit
effects
are
not
applied.
Spell
shields
will
block
a
single
shot.
Additional
Information:
While
similar
to
a
channel
,
The
Culling
is
only
interrupted
by
crowd
control
effects
that
inhibit
attacking
-
namely:
airborne,
forced
action,
stun,
suppression,
entangle
and
polymorph.
Silences
will
not
interrupt
it.
Interestingly,
blind
will
also
not
interrupt
The
Culling
as
Blind
does
not
actually
prevent
the
target
from
declaring
attacks.
Factoring
only
Lucian's
base
attack
speed
at
levels
6,
11
and
16,
he
will
fire
a
minimum
of
13
/
15
/
17
shots.
An
alternate
formula
for
calculating
the
number
of
shots
fired
is
13
/
15
/
17
(+1
per
20.
9
%
/
17.
4
%
/
14.
9
%
AS)
.
This
formula
may
prove
more
useful
for
calculating
the
efficiency
of
builds
outside
of
the
game
where
AS
is
presented
as
a
%
bonus
rather
than
as
attacks-per-second.
Temporary
attack
speed
steroids
that
are
active
on-cast
will
influence
the
shots
fired,
such
as
Youmuu's
Ghostblade
and
Blood
Boil
.
That
said,
The
Culling
will
ignore
the
bonus
attack
speed
from
Sword
of
the
Divine
.
This
is
a
special
case
to
prevent
abuse.
[2]
Lucian
can
also
activate
Ghost
,
Flash
and
interact
with
Dark
Passage
while
using
The
Culling.
For
the
purposes
of
skills
such
as
Backstab
and
Mocking
Shout
,
Lucian
is
facing
the
direction
of
his
movement,
not
the
direction
his
model
is
facing.
