At
2
stacks,
Diana
gains
an
on-hit
effect
which
deals
damage
in
a
point
blank
area
of
effect
.
The
ability
also
passively
grants
a
permanent
attack
speed
buff.
Does
not
apply
spell
effects
.
The
triggering
attack
will
apply
other
on-hit
effects
and
can
critically
strike
as
normal.
Critical
strikes
will
not
interact
with

damage
structures,
but
deals
only
50%
damage.

stacks
or

the
empowered
attack

autoattacks
are

,

,
or
if
the
attack
misses
.
Magic
damage
will
be
mitigated
by
Black
Shield
and
Lifeline
.
Spell
shields
will
block
the
damage.
Additional
Information:
Diana's
target
is
guaranteed
to
take
the
damage,
even
if
they
flash
out
of
range
before
the
attack
completes
(and
visually
aren't
within
the
area
of
effect).
Unlike
similar
effects,
such
as
Double
Strike
and
Headshot
,
there
is
no
visible
counter.
However,
each
of
the
three
attacks
in
the
cycle
has
a
distinct
animation
and
her
blade
will
glow
when
the
empowered
attack
is
ready.
The
area
of
effect
is
centered
on
Diana
-
not
her
target.
