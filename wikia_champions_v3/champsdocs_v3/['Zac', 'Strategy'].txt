Skill
usage
Although
all
of
Zac's
abilities
cost
4%
of
his
current
health,
the
cost
is
always
compensated
by
picking
up
the
blobs
from
Cell
Division
.
In
fact,
because
bloblets
recover
4%
of
Zac's
maximum
health,
picking
up
bloblets
has
a
net
healing
effect
which
is
increased
at
low
health.
Therefore,
do
not
be
afraid
to
spam
your
skills
provided
you
can
safely
collect
the
bloblets.
However,
do
not
overextend
to
collect
a
bloblet
if
doing
so
will
put
you
in
danger
of
enemy
damage
or
CC.
Cell
Division
allows
Zac
to
survive
many
situations
that
other
champions
could
not.
For
example,
getting
hit
by
Ignite
at
low
health
is
fatal
to
many
champions,
but
so
long
as
Zac
can
reach
safety,
he
will
be
able
to
"respawn"
with
50%
of
his
maximum
health.
This
also
includes
tower
diving.
At
maximum
range
of
the
turret,
at
least
two
of
Zac's
blobs
will
land
out
of
range,
allowing
him
to
survive
and
come
back
with
30%
of
his
maximum
health.
Stretching
Strike
is
a
powerful
slowing
ability
with
a
deceptively
long
range.
Use
this
ability
to
lock
down
targets
when
pursuing
or
escaping.
This
skill
can
be
cast
backwards
(opposite
to
the
direction
Zac
is
facing)
without
turning
Zac
around.
This
makes
it
easy
to
use
as
an
escape
skill.
Unstable
Matter
is
a
great
AoE
damage
ability.
It's
percent
damage
makes
it
perfect
for
clearing
jungle
camps
and
gives
Zac
strong
sustained
damage
against
enemy
champions.
Spamming
Unstable
Matter
is
a
massive
source
of
AoE
damage
in
team
fights
since
it
has
a
low
cooldown
and
the
percent
damage
is
effective
against
champions.
The
percent
damage
on
Unstable
Matter
actually
makes
it
a
worse
skill
for
farming
minions
in
lane
and
killing
the
small
jungle
creeps
because
of
their
low
maximum
health.
Zac
can
jump
over
walls
with
Elastic
Slingshot
,
allowing
him
to
avoid
area
with
a
Sight
Ward
in
them.
Therefore,
this
skill
is
invaluable
both
in
setting
up
and
performing
ganks.
When
initiating
using
Elastic
Slingshot
,
be
sure
to
jump
towards
the
back
of
the
enemy
team
in
an
attempt
to
hit
and
focus
the
AD/AP
carry.
The
combination
of
Elastic
Slingshot
and
Let's
Bounce!
is
an
amazing
initiation
tool,
which
can
easily
stack
a
team
fight
in
your
favor
from
the
beginning.
When
using
Let's
Bounce!
,
try
to
hit
each
member
of
the
enemy
team
at
least
once
to
maximize
the
damage
and
number
of
knock-ups
that
the
ability
can
achieve.
Although
you
cannot
use
Stretching
Strike
or
Elastic
Slingshot
during
Let's
Bounce!
,
you
can
use
Unstable
Matter
.
Take
advantage
of
this
to
maximize
Zac's
damage
output.
Even
when
building
very
tanky,
Zac
has
a
surprising
damage
output
in
teamfights.
The
enemy
team
will
either
be
forced
to
focus
you
(allowing
your
ADC
and
APC
to
wreak
havoc)
or
else
take
lots
of
damage
from
Zac's
abilities.
Using
Let's
Bounce!
will
result
in
the
dropping
of
four
blobs
from
Cell
Division
,
which
you
can
pick
up
for
a
whopping
16%
of
your
maximum
health
(19.2%
with
Spirit
Visage
)
This
makes
Zac's
a
deceptively
tanky
initiator.
You
will
likely
lose
a
lot
of
health
during
Let's
Bounce!
,
but
you
can
gain
most
of
this
back
so
long
as
your
resistances
are
high.
Build
usage
Zac
effectively
has
two
build
paths;
full
tank
and
AP
bruiser.
Tank
Randuin's
Omen
is
a
strong
item
on
Zac
for
a
tank
build,
since
it
provides
health,
armor,
and
useful
passive
effects.
Spirit
Visage
adds
sustain,
health,
cooldown
reduction,
and
magic
resistance,
all
of
which
benefit
Zac
greatly.
Since
Spirit
Visage
gives
cooldown
reduction
and
no
mana-related
stats,
making
it
perfect
for
Zac
.
For
boots,
your
decision
should
be
between
Mercury's
Treads
,
Ninja
Tabi
,
Boots
of
Mobility
.
Boots
of
Mobility
should
only
be
used
if
you
need
to
be
getting
back
to
lane
very
quickly,
or
if
you're
jungling
and
need
more
mobility.
Warmog's
Armor
should
be
taken
to
provide
tons
of
health
as
well
as
very
strong
health
regeneration
effect.
It
is
especially
effective
when
combined
with
Spirit
Visage
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
works
well
even
for
a
tank
build
because
it
provides
a
lot
of
health
and
gives
utility
and
bonus
damage.
Spirit
of
the
Ancient
Golem
can
be
useful
because
of
the
tenacity,
CDR
and
health.
Sunfire
Cape
is
amazing.
It
gives
AoE
damage,
health,
and
armor,
which
all
tanks
need
in
order
to
be
effective.
Locket
of
the
Iron
Solari
is
really
effective
on
all
tanks,
since
it
gives
health
and
armor,
as
well
as
an
active
that
allows
you
to
shield
your
entire
team,
making
your
strong
initiation
skills
even
stronger.
Bruiser
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
is
a
core
item
for
this
build.
The
slow,
health,
and
AP
all
work
perfectly
with
Zac's
damaging
style.
This
item
functions
well
in
combination
with
Sunfire
Cape
.
Abyssal
Scepter
can
be
used
to
provide
some
penetration
and
magic
resist
to
help
in
dealing
with
enemy
mages.
For
boots,
you
should
either
use
Mercury's
Treads
or
Sorcerer's
Shoes
.
The
decision
is
based
on
whether
you
want
survivability
or
magic
pen.
Like
with
the
Tank
build,
Randuin's
Omen
is
recommended,
as
it
provides
armor
and
health
to
deal
with
the
fact
that
Zac
needs
to
be
so
close
to
deal
damage
by
comparison
to
other
AP's.
Rabadon's
Deathcap
is
not
recommended,
but
can
be
used
if
more
damage
is
necessary.
Consider
substituting
it
with
a
Warmog's
Armor
for
more
survivability.
Zhonya's
Hourglass
is
a
viable
purchase
because
of
the
survivability
it
provides
as
well
as
the
large
amount
of
AP,
not
to
mention
the
active
effect.
Deathfire
Grasp
can
be
effective
on
Zac
since
it
gives
him
a
lot
of
ability
power
and
a
decent
amount
of
cooldown
reduction,
which
allows
him
to
spam
Unstable
Matter
more
quickly
and
increase
his
damage
output.
Liandry's
Torment
is
basically
a
must
on
him,
since
he
is
so
heavily
based
on
health
and
that
penetration
will
make
his
percent
damage
on
Unstable
Matter
even
more
potent.
This
is
a
particularly
effective
pick
in
combination
with
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
.
Since
penetration
works
so
well
in
combination
with
Unstable
Matter
,
Void
Staff
is
a
viable
pick.
Try
not
to
waste
gold
on
items
with
mana
or
mana
regeneration
components,
as
these
are
wasted
on
Zac.
Any
slots
not
taken
up
by
AP
items
should
be
slotted
to
increasing
survivability,
since
Zac
needs
to
be
so
close
to
enemies
to
effectively
deal
damage.
Other
notes
Spirit
Visage
is
highly
effective
on
him,
and
it
is
recommended
that
you
pick
it
up
regardless
of
build
path.

Countering
Zac
heals
from
the
goo
that
separates
from
him.
You
can
crush
the
goo
by
stepping
on
it.
Kill
all
of
Zac's
bloblets
when
he
splits
apart
to
prevent
him
from
reforming.
You
can
use
Ignite
and
Smite
on
the
bloblets.
Silences,
roots,
stuns
and
knockups
will
all
interrupt
the
charging
of
Zac's
Elastic
Slingshot
.
All
forms
of
crowd
control
are
especially
effective
against
Zac
,
since
without
mobility
to
allow
him
to
collect
his
healing
blobs
from
Cell
Division
and
he
will,
therefore,
chop
down
his
health.
Building
either
a
Executioner's
Calling
or
Morellonomicon
against
Zac
can
be
extremely
effective,
since
they
significantly
reduce
the
amount
that
he
can
heal.
Zac
needs
to
be
very
close
to
you
in
order
to
deal
the
majority
of
his
damage,
which
makes
kiting
a
very
viable
strategy.
Cell
Division
has
a
very
long
cooldown
of
five
minutes.
Popping
this
before
a
teamfight
or
other
major
engagement
can
cripple
his
effectiveness.
Be
sure
to
keep
an
eye
on
when
this
is
available,
as
it
will
allow
you
to
more
accurately
determine
whether
you
can
win
a
1v1
with
him.
