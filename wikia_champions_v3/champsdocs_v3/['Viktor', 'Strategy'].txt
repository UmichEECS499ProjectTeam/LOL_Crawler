Trivia
Skill
usage
Viktor's
early
laning
phase
is
perhaps
the
largest
stumbling
block
to
new
players.
Power
Transfer
can
be
used
to
last-hit
minions,
as
it
has
a
short
cooldown
and
a
low
mana
cost.
Take
any
opportunity
to
hit
your
opponent
with
Power
Transfer
,
although
bear
in
mind
its
mediocre
range
may
put
you
in
a
dangerous
position.
Keep
in
mind
that
offensive
use
of
Gravity
Field
in
a
lane
is
very
limited,
as
it
costs
a
lot
of
mana
and
has
a
too
short
range
to
be
used
safely
in
this
manner.
Try
to
use
it
for
zone
denial
and
as
a
defensive
measure
versus
ganks,
rather
than
relying
on
it
to
set
up
combos.
Death
Ray
can
be
used
to
quickly
clear
waves
when
returning
to
base,
or
preparing
to
roam
and
gank
another
lane.
Death
Ray
is
also
a
useful
long-range
poke/harassment
tool,
although
its
manacost
is
fairly
high
and
should
thus
be
used
sparingly.
Viktor's
lane
presence
increases
significantly
when
he
gets
his
ultimate
Chaos
Storm
;
combined
with
his
other
nukes
and
an
Ignite
he
can
easily
burst
down
most
other
mages.
Viktor
players
should
also
put
thought
into
which
of
their
basic
nukes
(
Power
Transfer
and
Death
Ray
)
should
be
maxed
out
first,
as
both
are
viable
but
more
suited
to
different
situations.
Ranks
into
Power
Transfer
will
increase
damage
and
make
its
cooldown
trivial,
and
the
mana
cost
increase
is
negligible.
The
shield
strength
boost
is
small
but
welcome.
However,
its
short
casting
range
will
force
Viktor
to
take
risks
during
skirmishes.
Max
out
Power
Transfer
when
Viktor's
opponents
have
little
to
no
long-range
option,
or
if
you
are
confident
you
can
skirt
battles
without
dying.
Less
practiced
Viktor
players
who
have
trouble
landing
Death
Ray
regularly
should
also
take
Power
Transfer
to
keep
their
damage
output
up.
Points
into
Death
Ray
will
also
increase
Viktor's
DPS
with
higher
damage
and
reduced
cooldowns.
However
the
main
differences
are
the
casting
range
and
AoE;
from
max
range
Death
Ray
can
allow
Viktor
to
damage
multiple
enemies
without
any
chance
of
retaliation.
A
well
aimed
cast
(with
some
ability
power
boosts)
will
also
clear
creep
waves
with
ease.
However,
the
mana
cost
increase
and
skillshot
requirement
are
notable
downsides
to
maxing
Death
Ray
.
In
higher
level
play,
you
will
want
to
max
Death
Ray
for
the
majority
of
your
games
as
it
is
Viktor's
wave-clearing
ability,
allowing
you
to
quickly
farm
a
wave
of
minions
then
move
out
to
take
map
objectives
or
gank.
Your
choice
of
upgrade
for
The
Hex
Core
is
a
major
factor
as
well,
since
ranks
in
the
Augmented
ability
will
increase
the
item's
effectiveness
drastically.
Smart-casting
Death
Ray
is
very
different
from
most
other
abilities,
and
will
take
practice
to
perfect.
One
method
is
to
place
your
mouse
at
the
starting
point,
then
"flick"
your
cursor
in
the
direction
you
wish
the
laser
to
travel.
Try
to
wait
for
people
to
fully
commit
to
a
fight
or
get
trapped
in
your
Gravity
Field
before
using
Chaos
Storm
,
as
it
deals
deceptively
strong
damage-over-time
if
enemies
stay
near
it.
Don't
forget
Chaos
Storm
has
a
silence
on
cast,
which
can
be
just
as
useful
as
the
damage.
Viktor
can
easily
interrupt
deadly
channeled
abilities
such
as
Katarina's
Death
Lotus
with
Chaos
Storm
.
Death
Ray
provides
sight
along
its
path.
Use
it
to
safely
check
the
brush
or
other
areas.
By
using
Gravity
Field
first,
you
can
often
ensure
hitting
an
enemy
with
Death
Ray
.
Keep
in
mind
when
the
enemy
notices
the
Gravity
Field
,
they
will
most
likely
run
away
(or
to
you
depending
on
the
closest
exit).
Place
your
Death
Ray
appropriately.
Viktor
holds
an
advantage
over
most
casters
due
to
Death
Ray
not
being
blockable
by
minions
or
a
point-and-click
cast
spell.
Use
it
to
punish
a
brazen
opponent
using
creep
to
try
and
shield
themselves
as
they
advance
onto
you.
Gravity
Field
can
be
very
powerful
for
escaping
melee
attackers.
By
placing
Gravity
Field
in
your
path,
enemies
will
be
either
forced
to
go
around
or
through
it,
slowing
them
down
either
way.
When
escaping
remember
that
the
shield
from
Power
Transfer
is
based
on
the
damage
it
does
before
reductions,
so
it
would
make
no
difference
in
shield
value
if
you
aim
at
a
minion
rather
than
a
pursing
champion.
Build
usage
Like
most
mages,
Viktor
benefits
greatly
from
ability
power
purchases.
A
Rabadon's
Deathcap
as
your
first
item
is
almost
never
a
bad
choice.
Due
to
Viktor's
relatively
short
spellcasting
range,
items
that
grant
him
some
survivability
through
health
,
armor
and
magic
resistance
will
aid
him
greatly.
Viktor's
need
to
fight
up
close
can
make
an
Abyssal
Scepter
well
worth
it,
with
its
aura
making
up
for
your
lower
AP.
It
may
also
be
necessary
to
get
Abyssal
Scepter
when
facing
mage-killer
champions
like
LeBlanc
and
Veigar
.
A
Rod
of
Ages
is
a
great
pick-up,
especially
if
Viktor
does
well
early
and
can
rush
Catalyst
the
Protector
.
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
grants
a
substantial
amount
of
health
alongside
AP.
More
importantly,
its
slow
effects
make
your
Chaos
Storm
even
more
potent
as
enemies
will
take
more
damage
trying
to
escape.
If
you
are
close-up
to
the
foe,
Chaos
Storm's
increased
movement
speed
and
chasing
ability
can
force
them
to
take
all
of
its
damage.
If
Augment:
Death
is
taken
along
with
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
,
Death
Ray's
damage
over
time
will
also
slow
opponents
for
the
duration.
As
Viktor
is
primarily
a
burst
mage
and
deals
most
of
his
damage
up-front,
a
Zhonya's
Hourglass
makes
a
good
complement
to
avoid
retaliation.
Gravity
Field
and
Chaos
Storm
will
also
remain
active
while
he
is
in
Stasis.
Athene's
Unholy
Grail
is
a
well-rounded
option
for
Viktor
;
it
solves
his
mana
issues
(noticeable
when
Death
Ray
is
maxed),
grants
a
decent
chunk
of
AP
and
MR,
and
perhaps
most
importantly
grants
valuable
cooldown
reduction
to
increase
the
uptime
of
his
devasting
Chaos
Storm
.
A
Will
of
the
Ancients
grants
Viktor
a
lot
of
sustain,
especially
due
to
the
low
cooldown
and
mana
cost
of
Power
Transfer
.
Chaos
Storm's
damage
over
time
will
also
help
to
keep
you
alive
in
teamfights.
Try
to
coordinate
The
Hex
Core
with
your
build:
Augment:
Power's
upgrade
for
additional
health
can
help
Viktor
survive
in
team
fights
or
the
lane.
It
also
gives
a
bonus
movement
speed
when
Power
Transfer
is
activated,
which
is
great
for
kiting
and
chasing
purposes.
The
Augment:
Gravity
upgrade
allows
Viktor
to
use
his
spells
more
frequently
thanks
to
the
bonus
mana
and
cooldown
reduction.
It
also
increases
the
cast
range
of
Gravity
Field
,
making
it
a
better
defensive
tool
and
a
more
viable
initiation
aid.
An
Augment:
Death
upgrade
grants
you
flat
Ability
Power,
and
even
more
damage
on
Death
Ray
.
This
is
generally
considered
to
be
the
best
choice
due
to
Viktor's
burst-damage
role
in
team
fights.
Remember
that
The
Hex
Core
will
still
grant
him
+3
Ability
Power
per
level,
regardless
of
the
Augment
he
is
using.
It
is
generally
ideal
to
upgrade
The
Hex
Core
as
soon
as
possible,
as
the
ability
enhancement
is
substantial
even
if
the
statistics
are
not.
Liandry's
Torment
is,
as
of
its
most
recent
buffs,
perhaps
Viktor's
core
offensive
item;
its
passive
synergizes
extremely
well
with
the
DoT
nature
of
his
Augmented
Death
Ray
and
Chaos
Storm
and
with
the
AoE
slow/stun
on
Gravity
Field
,
as
well
as
making
him
deadly
to
bruisy
targets
in
addition
to
squishies,
while
the
magic
penetration
complements
his
high
base
damages.
With
cheap
components
and
some
health
included
for
durability,
Liandry's
is
therefore
an
ideal
rush
item
after
one's
Augment.

Countering
Invest
in
a
magic
resistance
item
to
help
mitigate
Viktor's
damage.
Viktor
gains
a
Hex
Core
at
the
start
of
the
game
from
his
Evolving
Technology
.
It
is
wise
to
know
the
Hex
Core's
Augments
to
counter
him.
Also,
remember
that
Hex
Core
can
only
be
upgraded
once.
Remember
that
augmented
Power
Transfer
will
give
him
movement
speed
to
help
him
escape
from
or
catch
up
to
you.
Death
Ray
has
a
very
long
range,
especially
once
Augmented,
as
it
deals
30%
more
damage.
Viktor
is
a
vunerable
champion
early-game
in
general;
he
is
fairly
squishy,
has
low
escapability,
and
low
base
movement
speed.
Harass
him
if
you
are
particularly
good
at
doing
it,
and
try
to
starve
him
of
farm
by
freezing
the
lane.
Most
importantly,
due
to
his
vunerablility,
take
any
opportunity
you
can
to
make
ganks
happen.
Death
Ray
travels
in
a
straight
line
(start
to
end),
so
by
side
stepping
immediately
you
can
dodge
the
ability.
Quickly
move
away
from
the
AoE
of
Gravity
Field
to
deny
Viktor
the
chance
to
stun
you.
Champions
who
can
remove
disables
(such
as
Olaf
or
Gangplank
)
are
safe
from
Viktor's
only
defense
mechanism,
and
should
exploit
this.
Chaos
Storm
will
damage
you
continously
if
you
stay
too
close
to
the
storm.
By
moving
away
from
the
storm,
you
can
negate
the
storm's
damage.
Viktor
only
has
his
Gravity
Field
to
escape
pursuers,
and
is
relatively
fragile
once
focused.
Exploit
his
low
mobility
if
he
ever
uses
Gravity
Field
in
a
sub-optimal
manner.
