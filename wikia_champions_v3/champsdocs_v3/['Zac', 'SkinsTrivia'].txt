Trivia
Zac
was
designed
by
SubNinja
[1]
Zac
is
voiced
by
Patrick
Warburton
,
who
also
voices
Volibear
.
Zac
is
one
of
the
unidentified
silhouettes
in
Battle
Bunny
Riven's
splash
art,
which
can
be
seen
here
.
[2]
Z.A.C
stands
for
Zaun
Amorphous
Combatant
A
blob-like
creature
made
an
appearance
in
the
Mac
Debut
Video
,
possibly
referring
to
Zac.
Zac
has
a
hidden
passive
;
he
grows
larger
the
more
health
he
has
and
shrinks
the
lower
the
health
he
has
left.
This
passive
resembles
The
Blob
,
who,
grew
and
shrank
based
on
the
amount
of
people
it
absorbed
Contrary
to
popular
belief,
Zac
is
not
among
the
few
champions
who
can
CC
themselves.
Elastic
Slingshot
is
a
channeled
ability,
which
is
not
considered
a
form
of
crowd
control.
Zac's
promotional
text
in
the
League
of
Legends
Launcher
is
a
reference
to
the
Star
Trek
franchise,
which
Original
Series'
Intro
told
of
the
Enterprise
"to
boldly
go
where
no
man
has
gone
before".
Due
to
the
game
treating
the
blobs
from
Cell
Division
as
minions,
he
is
the
only
champion
that
can
be
damaged
by
spells
like
Smite
or
Consume
,
and
can
be
teleported
to.
Zac's
appearance
and
move-set
closely
mirrors
that
of
the
Rainbow
Devil
from
Mega
Man
Zero
.
Zac's
appearance
and
his
passive
resembles
the
Amoeboids
of
the
Ratchet
&
Clank
series.
Zac's
name
is
a
reference
to
the
film
John
Carter;
to
the
aliens
native
to
mars,
the
word
"zac"
means
"to
jump".
Zac
is
the
only
champion
to
have
2
laughing
animations.
One
where
he
roars
triumphantly
into
the
air,
and
another
where
he
shyly
looks
around
to
see
if
anyone
sees
him
laughing.
Skins
Zac's
classic
skin
also
greatly
resembles
the
amorphous
creature
from
the
movie
Flubber
.
Special
Weapon
Zac
skin
bears
a
resemblance
to
the
Ing
from
Metroid
Prime
2
,
and
to
[1]
from
Teen
Titans
.
Special
Weapon
Zac
old
PBE
name
(Grumpy
Zac)
was
an
homage
to
Grumpy
Monkey,
the
rioter
who
teased
Zac
in
the
first
place
(his
icon
is
Zac
from
Battle
Bunny
Riven's
splash
art).
Quotes
Zac's
quote
"I'm
not
as
squishy
as
I
look."
is
a
reference
to
players
referring
to
defensively
weaker
champions
as
"squishy",
which
Zac
is
not
commonly
considered
to
be.
Zac's
quote
"I
should
get
a
suit."
is
a
reference
to
Barney
Stinson
from
How
I
Met
Your
Mother
.
Relations
Unlike
other
city-state
champions
of
Zaun,
Zac
is
the
only
one
known
who
is
neither
mentally
unstable
or
morally
questionable.
