Lore
When
the
people
of
Valoran
speak
of
the
"Battle
Mistress",
there
is
only
one
woman
to
whom
they
refer.
Combining
unflinching
bravery
with
prowess
in
combat
and
endless
ambition,
Sivir's
reputation
as
a
fortune
hunter
is
only
rivaled
by
her
amassed
wealth
and
acclaim.
Faced
with
the
revelation
of
her
mysterious
heritage,
Sivir
must
now
weigh
her
desire
to
follow
her
own
path
against
the
burden
of
a
greater
legacy.
Sivir
grew
up
among
the
desert
nomads
of
Shurima
,
mastering
the
art
of
tomb
robbing
and
enjoying
a
life
without
strong
ties
to
any
one
place.
She
excelled
at
the
mercenary
life,
accumulating
riches,
followers
and
reputation
with
ease.
As
her
fame
spread
beyond
the
desert
sands,
she
caught
the
attention
of
wealthy
patrons
across
all
of
Valoran
.
The
most
influential
of
these
benefactors
was
Noxus
High
Command.
Sivir
served
the
whims
of
the
brutal
nation
with
little
concern
for
consequence.
Their
partnership
proved
to
be
a
profitable
one
until
the
Ionian
conflict
broke
out.
She
chose
to
take
no
part
in
the
messy
invasion
and
severed
her
ties.
It
was
no
surprise
to
Sivir
when
the
Noxians
next
paid
her
a
visit,
but
where
she
expected
assassins,
she
instead
received
an
offer.
Cassiopeia
,
the
daughter
of
one
of
Noxus's
most
influential
families,
claimed
to
have
unearthed
the
location
of
ancient
Shurima's
greatest
treasure.
All
that
the
noblewoman
required
was
an
experienced
tomb
robber
as
an
escort.
The
expedition
proved
to
be
more
than
Sivir
and
Cassiopeia
bargained
for.
The
ancient
tomb
held
neither
the
treasure
Cassiopeia
had
promised,
nor
the
weapon
she
coveted.
Despite
Sivir's
warnings,
the
Noxian
flung
open
the
door
to
the
entombed
vault,
setting
events
in
motion
that
would
change
not
just
Sivir's
life,
but
all
of
Shurima
forever.
"What's
lost
can
be
found...
and
sold."
―
Sivir
The
beautiful
and
deadly
champion
known
as
Sivir
has
been
a
favorite
of
League
summoners
since
the
first
days.
A
soldier-for-hire
outside
of
the
Fields
of
Justice
,
she
is
the
embodiment
of
a
highly
successful
mercenary
on
modern
day
Runeterra
.
Sivir
has
little
interest
in
the
cribbage
sheets
-
as
she
calls
them
-
of
League
influence
bartering.
Instead,
she
is
motivated
by
material
wealth
and
riches,
and
she
is
paid
handsomely
for
her
services.
Sivir
is
one
of
the
wealthiest
individuals
found
anywhere
on
Valoran
.
Sivir
owns
multiple
residences
in
a
number
of
different
city-states,
as
well
as
ownership
stakes
in
a
number
of
businesses
all
across
Valoran.
Her
detractors,
either
envious
of
her
success
or
acrimonious
of
her
flexible
morality,
have
begun
to
use
Sivir
as
a
symbol
of
what
is
wrong
with
the
mercenary
nature
of
the
League.
Sivir
dismisses
her
critics,
saying
that
while
her
personal
code
of
ethics
is
less
ruthless
than
her
competitors,
"Everyone
has
a
price".
Sivir
has
earned
many
titles
and
accolades
throughout
her
illustrious
career,
but
the
one
she
held
until
recently
was
"Battle
Mistress
of
Noxus
".
Now
she
is
simply
known
as
"The
Battle
Mistress"
after
breaking
her
contract
with
the
Noxian
High
Command.
Sivir
dared
to
object
to
the
Noxian
war
against
the
peaceful
island
state
of
Ionia
,
though
less
about
the
morality
of
the
issue
than
the
planning
behind
it;
her
predictions
of
a
bloody
stalemate
came
true
when
the
Ionians
held
off
the
relentless
assaults
of
the
Noxians.
Claiming
that
the
Noxian
High
Command
had
lost
its
direction,
she
left
Noxus
and
made
her
services
available
to
the
Institute
of
War
.
The
Noxian
High
Command
has
sent
a
number
of
contracted
assassins
to
deal
with
its
rogue
mercenary,
but
none
have
delivered
her
or
survived.
"Time
and
time
again,
Sivir
proves
that
she
has
earned
the
right
to
call
herself
'The
Battle
Mistress'."
