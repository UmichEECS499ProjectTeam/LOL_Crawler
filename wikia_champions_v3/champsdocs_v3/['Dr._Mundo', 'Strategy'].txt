Skill
usage
Dr.
Mundo
can
stay
in
lane
very
long
since
he
is
manaless
and
his
Adrenaline
Rush
allows
him
to
constantly
regenerate
health
.
His
base
health
at
level
18
is
2035
and
his
base
HP5
at
level
18
is
20.
Combined
with
his
passive
of
1.5%
health
every
5
seconds,
Dr.
Mundo's
minimum
base
HP5
at
level
18
is
effectively
50.5.
Infected
Cleaver
is
very
effective
in
taking
out
neutral
camps.
It
deals
damage
based
on
a
monster's
health,
so
Dr.
Mundo
can
jungle
effectively.
Because
Infected
Cleaver
makes
a
distinctive
splat
noise
and
returns
health
when
it
hits
an
enemy,
it
can
be
used
reliably
for
checking
bushes
for
enemies.
Since
Burning
Agony
also
gives
you
crowd
control
reduction
in
addition
to
the
damage,
don't
forget
to
use
it
during
team
fights
or
while
chasing/fleeing
especially
against
crowd
control
heavy
enemies.
Also,
the
reduction
does
stack
with
Mercury's
Treads
and
Spirit
of
the
Ancient
Golem
to
make
crowd
control
very
ineffective
against
Dr.
Mundo
.
A
well-timed
Sadism
can
bait
enemy
champions
into
attacking
you
even
when
they
lack
the
damage
to
finish
you.
Force
enemies
to
chase
you
across
the
map
in
their
attempt
to
finish
you
off,
if
you
can-
sadism's
speed
boost
combined
with
the
cc
reduction
of
Burning
Agony
makes
taking
out
Mundo
frustratingly
difficult.
After
you
reach
level
6,
you
should
rarely
have
to
leave
your
lane.
Although
Dr.
Mundo
abilities
use
health,
his
Sadism
has
a
fairly
short
cooldown
so
you
can
regain
lost
health
about
once
every
minute.
Sadism
continues
to
heal
you
when
you're
resurrecting
from
Guardian
Angel
.
Timing
a
Sadism
well
with
Guardian
Angel
is
a
very
good
way
to
bait
and
finish
off
low
health
opponents
who
wait
for
you
to
resurrect.
Due
to
a
tendency
for
many
players
to
counteract
Dr.
Mundo's
health
regeneration
with
Ignite
,
taking
Cleanse
as
a
summoner
spell
might
seem
like
a
good
choice;
however,
it
does
not
actually
remove
the
healing
debuff,
only
the
DoT.
It
does
combine
well
with
Burning
Agony
to
cause
strong
crowd
control
resistance,
though.
You
can
remove
the
ignite
debuff
mentioned
above
with
a
Quicksilver
Sash
,
it
cleanses
the
healing
reduction
debuff,
and
gives
MR,
giving
Mundo
better
tanking
capabilities.
Sadism
,
Infected
Cleaver
,
and
Exhaust
make
Dr.
Mundo
an
amazing
chaser
who
can
chase
champions
all
the
way
back
to
their
spawning
pools
for
kills.
Since
Sadism
is
a
regeneration
buff
and
not
a
heal
it
will
give
you
the
most
survivability
if
activated
right
before
you
take
major
damage.
Keep
in
mind
the
regeneration
speed
relies
upon
a
percentage
of
your
maximum
health,
so
stack
up
for
the
fastest
regeneration
possible!
Build
usage
Spirit
Visage
is
a
very
effective
item
for
Mundo
due
to
its
20%
boost
to
regenerative
effects,
cooldown
reduction
,
and
extra
tankiness,
all
of
which
benefit
Dr.
Mundo
.
Spirit
of
the
Ancient
Golem
is
good
too
since
it
gives
you
a
sizable
amount
of
health,
faster
clearing
and
more
Tenacity.
Warmog's
Armor
offers
a
lot
of
health
regeneration
without
any
life
steal,
even
more
when
Adrenaline
Rush
and
Sadism
are
taken
into
consideration.
With
it,
Mundo's
health
regen
will
outpace
the
health
cost
of
Burning
Agony
.
Be
wary
of
buying
too
many
health
items
like
Warmog's
Armor
or
Frozen
Mallet
if
the
enemy
team
has
a
champion
that
can
deal
percent
health
damage,
such
as
Kog'Maw
or
Elise
,
as
such
kinds
of
damage
can
make
quick
work
of
your
health.
However,
this
counter
loses
its
effectiveness
if
you
build
armor
or
magic
resistance
to
reduce
the
damage
by
a
significant
percentage.
Stacking
health
and
getting
an
Atma's
Impaler
can
greatly
boost
your
damage,
synergizing
with
Masochism
,
as
well
as
increasing
your
survivability.
Attack
speed
items
or
critical
chance
items
(
Wit's
End
/
Zeal
)
greatly
increase
Dr.
Mundo's
damage
output
with
Masochism
.
Sunfire
Cape
paired
with
Wit's
End
offer
Dr.
Mundo
a
lot
of
valuable
stats
-
health,
armor,
magic
resist
and
attack
speed.
Magic
Penetration
is
overall
more
useful
to
Dr.
Mundo
than
ability
power,
because
Dr.
Mundo's
Infected
Cleaver
gains
no
benefit
from
ability
power
since
its
damage
is
based
on
enemy
health,
but
still
deals
magic
damage.
Sorcerer's
Shoes
or
Haunting
Guise
are
all
superb
choices
for
anyone
wanting
to
increase
the
damage
output
of
Mundo's
Cleaver
and
Burning
Agony.
Getting
a
Furor
boots
upgrade
gives
Dr.Mundo
an
advantage
over
his
enemy,
allowing
him
to
gain
movement
speed
from
his
Infected
Cleaver
as
well
as
slowing
his
target
down.
A
Liandry's
Torment
is
a
great
buy
as
it
has
health,
magic
pen,
and
a
passive
that
procs
on
his
Infected
Cleaver.
If
you
wish
to
stick
to
your
targets,
it
may
be
wise
to
buy
one
of
the
following
items
as
they
both
give
a
large
amount
of
health.
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
gives
a
15%
slow
that
synergizes
well
with
Burning
Agony
.
Frozen
Mallet
lets
you
apply
a
40%
slow
on
your
basic
attacks
to
compliment
Infected
Cleaver
while
it's
on
cooldown.

Countering
Debuffs
from
Executioner's
Calling
,
Morellonomicon
and
Ignite
can
be
an
extremely
effective
counter
to
Sadism
and
weaken
his
regeneration
tremendously.
If
playing
against
a
good
Dr.
Mundo
one
of
these
three
should
always
be
available
in
team
battles.
Dr.
Mundo
is
also
effectively
countered
by
champions
with
healing
reduction
abilities,
such
as
Fizz
,
Katarina
,
Miss
Fortune
,
and
Tristana
.
Don't
stack
health
when
facing
Dr.
Mundo
,
as
it
increases
his
damage
from
Infected
Cleaver
.
