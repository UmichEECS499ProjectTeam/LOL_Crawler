Trivia
Skill
Usage
Saving
energy
and
spell
cooldowns
until
you
use
your
ultimate
will
potentially
maximize
Death
Mark's
damage.
By
quickly
activating
Living
Shadow
twice,
Zed
will
send
out
his
shadow
and
immediately
teleport
to
it
afterwards,
allowing
for
quick
escapes.
This
can
be
used
to
go
over
walls.
Use
Shadow
Slash
when
your
enemy
catches
up
with
the
shadow
to
slow
them
and
prevent
pursuit.
Living
Shadow
provides
vision,
which
can
be
used
to
check
bushes
or
scout
over
walls.
If
you
move
too
far
away
from
the
shadow(s)
created
by
Living
Shadow
and
Death
Mark
you
can
no
longer
switch
places
with
them.
An
arrow
indicates
the
direction
of
the
shadow
from
Zed
and
changes
colors
depending
on
distance.
If
it
is
green
then
Zed
is
close
enough
to
the
shadow
to
swap
positions
with
it;
yellow
means
Zed
can
still
switch
places
with
it
but
will
soon
be
out
of
range
while
red
means
he
cannot.
Placing
a
Living
Shadow
before
using
Death
Mark
can
give
Zed
a
safe
escape
from
combat.
The
skills
also
may
allow
you
to
catch
enemies
off
guard
after
a
small
skirmish.
Using
Death
Mark
primarily
for
damage,
do
not
forget
that
it
places
a
Living
Shadow
at
the
location
of
the
cast.
Faking
retreat
after
a
kill,
deceive
your
enemy
by
swapping
places
with
your
ultimate's
shadow
and
use
your
Living
Shadow
to
effectively
give
your
Razor
Shuriken
50%
more
damage
output.
Three
overlapping
Shadow
Slashes
will
apply
a
stronger
slow
than
just
two,
however
won't
do
any
additional
damage.
If
you
already
have
a
shadow
up
from
your
Death
Mark
,
strongly
consider
saving
your
Living
Shadow
for
escaping
or
chasing.
In
order,
using
Death
Mark
,
Shadow
Slash
,
Razor
Shuriken
,
and
an
autoattack
(if
not,
an
additional
Living
Shadow
)
to
proc
Contempt
for
the
Weak
can
deal
enough
burst
damage
to
kill
a
squishy
enemy.
If
you're
in
danger
and
your
marked
target
is
low
enough,
you
may
be
able
to
use
Living
Shadow
to
escape
(or
Death
Mark
if
it's
safe
enough
due
to
it's
longer
duration)
and
wait
for
the
mark
from
Death
Mark
to
kill
the
target.
Be
wary
of
effects
that
can
deny
you
the
kill
or
even
turn
the
tables,
such
as
Wish
,
Chrono
Shift
,
or
Intervention
.
With
just
10%
cooldown
reduction
the
cooldown
of
Shadow
Slash
becomes
short
enough
to
land
two
of
them
before
Death
Mark
's
damage
triggers.
This
can
be
used
against
enemies
who
not
consider
Zed's
cooldowns.
With
maximum
CDR
(40%)
you
can
get
off
3
Shadow
Slash
and
barely
get
off
2
Razor
Shuriken
during
a
single
Living
Shadow
or
Death
Mark
.
Consider
finding
a
way
to
fit
it
into
your
late
game
item
build.
Both
Living
Shadow
and
Death
Mark
come
in
very
handy
when
running
away
from
an
enemy
champion
or
two.
The
first
tactic
is
to
place
Living
Shadow
in
a
bush
opposite
of
the
direction
you
are
running
in,
slow
them
with
Shadow
Slash
and
switch
places
with
your
shadow
afterwards
for
a
nifty
escape
trick.
The
second
is
to
place
your
shadow
behind
you
and
run
in
the
opposite
direction
in
an
attempt
to
have
them
dodge
an
uncasted
Shadow
Slash
or
Razor
Shuriken
,
then
cast
Death
Mark
to
fool
your
pursuer
into
chasing
you
while
you
escape
with
your
Living
Shadow
and
then
your
ultimate's.
In
some
cases
these
strategies
are
way
better
than
just
simply
using
Living
Shadow
as
a
quick
flash
to
safety,
and
might
even
ensure
a
kill.
Death
Mark
gives
a
short
time
on
invulnerability,
especially
since
having
a
slightly
longer
duration
compared
to
Hallucinate
.
Use
it
to
avoid
channeled
spells
such
as
Absolute
Zero
,
Requiem
,
Noxian
Guillotine
,
or
with
good
timing,
last-moment
skillshots
and
autoattacks.
Zed's
Contempt
for
the
Weak
makes
him
very
good
at
last
hitting/stealing
important
monster
kills
especially
in
the
jungle,
but
be
careful
when
laning
as
if
you
abuse
the
bonus
damage
too
much
you
might
end
up
pushing
the
lane
to
your
disadvantage.
An
effective
way
to
guarantee
kills
is
to
have
deception
as
your
ally.
Letting
a
bruiser
(an
ADC/APC
as
a
weaker
bait
might
work
occasionally)
initiate
on
the
enemy
can
ensure
an
advantage,
often
providing
a
good
"clearing
up"
for
a
shutdown
kill
or
even
an
ace.
This
tactic
becomes
extremely
potent
in
late-game
teamfights,
as
even
though
Death
Mark
's
damage
is
primarily
single-target,
Shadow
Slash
and
Razor
Shuriken
's
damage
remains
AOE,
being
able
to
shred
through
carries
and
groups
of
champions
with
ease.
If
you
are
affected
by
Death
Mark
and
a
shuriken
appears
over
your
head,
try
to
heal
or
shield,
because
that
means
that
Zed
is
gonna
kill
you.
Item
Usage
Zed
plays
as
an
AD
Caster
making
AD
,
armor
penetration
and
CDR
more
valuable
than
critical
strike
and
attack
speed
.
Last
Whisper
is
a
good
core
item
on
Zed
due
to
its
AD
and
Armor
Penetration.
The
Black
Cleaver
is
another
excellent
core
item
on
him
since
it
builds
out
of
The
Brutalizer
and
all
of
its
stats
benefit
him
greatly.
If
while
playing
Zed
you
find
yourself
dominating
consider
building
a
Sword
of
the
Occult
.
Due
to
the
passive
effect
of
his
Living
Shadow
,
Zed
can
benefit
from
every
AD
item
like
an
AP
champ
would
with
Rabadon's
Deathcap,
and
thus
can
obtain
very
high
amount
of
AD
on
late
game.
With
fully
stacked
Sword
of
the
Occult
and
The
Bloodthirster
and
no
other
damage
items,
he
can
reach
262.5
bonus
AD,
although
stacking
the
Sword
of
the
Occult
and
keeping
it
stacked
can
be
difficult
in
a
lot
of
matches.
Another
good
combination
of
items
is
The
Bloodthirster
,
and
Youmuu's
Ghostblade
as
they
both
synergize
well
with
his
abilities.
Getting
Maw
of
Malmortius
can
be
a
good
choice
if
you
are
being
bullied
by
opponents
with
large
amounts
of
magic
damage.
The
active
from
Sword
of
the
Divine
works
surprisingly
well
with
his
Ult
-
Zed
generally
achieves
high
amounts
of
AD,
causing
the
crits
to
deal
high
damage
on
top
of
Death
Mark's
damage.
A
Blade
of
the
Ruined
King
allows
Zed
to
fight
1v1's
extremely
well,
as
it
adds
extra
single
target
damage
that
allows
him
to
keep
on
top
of
his
opponent
aswell
as
increasing
the
total
damage
when
his
Death
Mark
pops.
The
extra
attack
speed
also
allows
him
to
take
down
towers
quickly,
in
combination
with
the
active
allows
him
to
splitpush,
knowing
you'll
be
able
to
kill
most
of
the
things
that
are
sent
at
you.
The
high
AD
and
active
from
Tiamat
/
Ravenous
Hydra
can
add
significant
damage
to
the
Ult.
Zed
starts
auto-attacking
his
target
automatically.
After
the
first
hit,
use
the
active
to
deal
more
damage,
reset
the
attack
timer
and
attack
again.
The
combination
can
be
as
much
as
300%
of
Zed's
AD
in
a
very
short
time.
This
item
also
includes
a
lot
of
extra
wave
clear
for
Zed,
increasing
his
splitpush
potential
further.
If
Zed's
opponents
have
high
amounts
of
crowd
control,
and
he
finds
himself
being
locked
down,
a
Quicksilver
Sash
/
Mercurial
Scimitar
can
be
effective,
not
only
reducing
magic
damage
on
him
from
his
opponents,
the
upgrade
gives
him
a
considerable
amount
of
AD.
Once
Zed
has
his
6
item
build,
it
is
possible
to
replace
his
boots
with
a
Zephyr
to
increase
his
overall
DPS
in
teamfights
as
it
will
reduce
Crowd
Control
effects
on
him,
as
well
as
making
his
combat
stats
stronger
and
the
10%
movement
speed
makes
up
for
the
amount
lost
from
not
having
boots
fairly
well.
As
some
games
go,
it
is
relatively
more
cost
efficient
to
rush
a
Guardian
Angel
as
the
enemy
players
will
be
quick
to
focus
on
Zed
in
a
team
fight.

Countering
After
Zed
uses
his
Living
Shadow
and
Death
Mark
,
he
is
at
his
most
vulnerable
as
his
damage
and
mobility
are
both
dependent
upon
it.
Zed's
Razor
Shurikens
deals
less
damage
if
they
pass
through
other
units
before
hitting
your
champion.
Escaping
laterally,
rather
than
directly
away,
from
Zed
when
he
uses
his
ultimate
will
slightly
limit
his
ability
to
slow
and
pursue
your
champion.
Be
aware
of
Zed's
clone
as
he
can
use
it
to
mimic
Shadow
Slash
and
Razor
Shuriken
even
when
he
is
out
of
sight,
giving
him
deceptively
long
range.
On
that
note,
be
very
careful
when
towerhugging
at
low
health,
as
he
can
easily
kill
you
while
only
taking
a
minimial
amount
of
damage
from
the
tower.
Zed
can
be
extremely
vulnerable
after
he
uses
Death
Mark
,
as
he
will
most
likely
use
all
of
his
abilities
to
do
as
much
damage
as
possible.
If
you
have
any
hard
CC,
try
to
save
it
for
after
Zed
activates
Death
Mark
(and
if
possible,
Living
Shadow
)
,
as
this
will
both
reduce
the
time
he
has
to
combo
the
mark
and
give
the
marked
champion
a
chance
to
escape.
The
delayed-effect
damage
caused
by
Zed's
ultimate
can
be
prevented
by
activating
a
Quicksilver
Sash
(
or
Mercurial
Scimitar
)
within
the
3
seconds
before
the
mark
detonates.
Cleanse
and
Remove
Scurvy
will
not
remove
the
mark.
Zhonya's
Hourglass
is
a
great
item
to
counter
Zed
as
a
mage,
with
armor
to
protect
you
and
the
active
to
avoid
the
worst
of
his
Death
Mark
.
Beware,
Zed
is
surprisingly
dangerous
especially
when
assassinating
low-health
champions
due
to
Contempt
for
the
Weak
.
