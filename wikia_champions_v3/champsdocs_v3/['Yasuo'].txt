Yasuo,
the
Unforgiven
is
a
champion
in
League
of
Legends
.
[1]
Abilities
Yasuo's
abilities
have
no
cost
related
to
them
and
their
use
is
limited
only
by
cooldowns.
His
secondary
resource
bar
tracks
his
unique
mechanic:
Flow.
Yasuo
can
have
up

Flow.
Yasuo
generates
1%
of
his
maximum
Flow
with
every
46
units
he
travels,
requiring
a
total
of
4600
units-traveled
to
obtain
maximum
Flow.
Flow
does
not
decay
or
generate
idly.
As
Flow
generation
is
based
on
distance
travelled,
it
is
also
accumulated
while
dashing,
teleporting
or
when
displaced
by
crowd
control
effects.
Way
of
the
Wanderer
Intent:
Yasuo's
critical
strike
chance
is
doubled,
but
the
damage
dealt
by
his
critical
strikes
is
reduced
by
10%
(25%
on
Steel
Tempest).
Resolve:
At
maximum
Flow,
the
next
time
Yasuo
would
take
damage
from
a
champion
or
monster
he
first
converts
his
Flow
into
a
shield
that
absorbs
damage.
After
1.5
seconds,
if
not
already
depleted,
Yasuo
loses
all
his
Flow.
Ability
Details
Way
of
the
Wanderer
consists
of
two
independent
passive
abilities.
Additional
Information:
The
damage
reduction
applies
to
the
total
damage
dealt
(before
damage
mitigation).
A
standard
critical
strike's
200%
damage
is
reduced
to
180%,
and
a
critical
strike
with
Infinity
Edge
deals
225%
damage
instead
of
250%.
The
reduction
is
not
a
subtraction
to
his
critical
strike
damage
statistic.
The
10%
damage
penalty
will
not
affect
any
on-hit
effect
(such
as
Trinity
Force
),
with
the
exception
of
Statikk
Shiv
.
Critically
strike
with
Steel
Tempest
does
not
affect
the
20
/
40
/
60
/
80
/
100
base
damage
(both
for
the
purposes
of
calculating
the
bonus
damage
or
being
reduced
by
the
10%
penalty).
Once
the
Flow
bar
is
full,
upon
taking
damage
from
a
champion
or
neutral
monster,
resolve
first
produces
a
shield
that
reduces
the
incoming
damage
by
an
amount
up
to
the
current
maximum
amount
of
Flow
for
up
to
2
seconds.
Damage
that
is
negated
by
Resolve's
shield
appears
as
a
blue
indicator.
For
example,
-60

Consecutive
successful
casts
of
Steel
Tempest
within
10
seconds
form
a
chain.
First
Active:
Yasuo
thrusts
his
sword
forward,
dealing
physical
damage
to
all
enemies
in
a
475-unit
line.
If
cast
while
using
Sweeping
Blade,
the
area
of
effect
is
changed
to
a
~375-radius
circle
around
Yasuo.
Second
Active:
Same
as
the
first
active.
Third
Active:
Yasuo
brandishes
his
sword
causing
a
whirlwind
to
tear
forward
in
a
~900-unit
line,
dealing
physical
damage
and
knocking
airborne
all
enemies
hit.
If
cast
while
using
Sweeping
Blade,
the
area
of
effect
is
changed
to
an
~375-radius
circle
around
Yasuo.
This
active
resets
the
chain.
Steel
Tempest
can
critically
strike,
having
a
25%
damage
penalty.
Without
any
additional
critical
damage
the
bonus
damage
equals
50%
of
Yasuo's
attack
damage
.
Additionally,
on-hit
effects
will
be
applied
to
the
first
enemy
hit
within
475-unit
range.
The
cooldown
and
cast
time
of
Steel
Tempest
is
reduced
based
on
Yasuo's
bonus
attack
speed
and
unaffected
by
cooldown
reduction.

Details
Steel
Tempest
is
a
pass-through
skill
shot
that
uses
quick
cast
by
default.
The
third
active
knocks
airborne
all
enemies
in
its
path.
On-hit
effects
are
applied
to
the
first
enemy
hit.
PENDING
FOR
TEST
Steel
Tempest's
relationship
with
dodge
,
parry
,
block
and
blind
has
yet
to
be
tested.
Spell
shields
will
block
the
ability.
Additional
Information:
The
cooldown
of
Steel
Tempest
is
unaffected
by
cooldown
reduction
and
is
instead
reduced
by
1%
for
every
1.
72
%
of
his
bonus
attack
speed.
This
is
capped
at
66%
cooldown
reduction
with
114%
bonus
attack
speed.
At
max
rank,
the
minimum
cooldown
is
1.
33
seconds
(1.
4
attack
speed).
Yasuo's
3.
5
%
attack
speed
per
level
is
factored
into
Steel
Tempest's
cooldown
reduction
and
cast
time
reduction.
At
level
18,
Yasuo
has
a
total
of
59%
bonus
attack
speed
from
leveling
alone
which
reduces
Steel
Tempest's
cooldown
by
34%
(and
he
requires
only
55%
attack
speed
from
items,
runes
and
masteries
to
reach
the
cap).
Steel
Tempest's
cooldown
is
effectively
reduced
by
2.
03
%
per
level.
Way
of
the
Wanderer's
critical
strike
damage
penalty
with
Steel
Tempest
is
25%
instead
of
10%.
With
100%
critical
damage
(base),
the
bonus
damage
equates
to
simply
50%
AD
(200%
×
.
75
);
with
150%
critical
damage
(Base
+
Infinity
Edge
),
the
bonus
damage
equates
to
87.
5
%
AD
(250%
×
.
75
).
Critically
striking
with
Steel
Tempest
is
calculated
on
cast,
not
per
enemy
hit.
The
third
cast
will
still
knock
enemies
airborne
when
it
strikes
as
a
point-blank
area
of
effect.

form

400
units
away
from
himself.
The
wall
slowly
drifts
forward
over
3.

seconds,
blocking
all
enemy
projectiles
with
the
exception
of
tower
hits.

Ability
Details
Wind
Wall
is
a
ground-targeted
area
of
effect
that
slowly
drifts
forward
over
the
duration.
Wind
Wall
is
always
cast
at
maximum
range.
Additional
Information:
Sweeping
Blade
will
generate
~7%
of
Yasuo's
maximum
flow
innately
as
Flow-generation
is
based
on
distance
traveled.
The
4-20%
gained
from
Wind
Wall
will
stack
additively
(i.e.
in
addition
to).
The
gust
of
wind
takes
~0.
25
seconds
to
travel
forward
from
Yasuo
to
form
the
wall,
but
will
still
block
projectiles
as
with
the
fully
formed
wall
during
that
time
(for
a
total
of
4
seconds
as
listed
in
the
in-game
tooltip).
The
wall
grants
sight
over
a
small
area.
A
projectile
is
any
entity
with
a
velocity
that
is
not
classified
as
a
unit
(champions,
minions,
monsters,
etc).
Moving
units
are
not
blocked
under
any
circumstance,
including
dash
abilities.
Champion-summoned
units,
such
as
Orianna's
Command:
Attack
and
Maokai's
Sapling
Toss
,
are
not
considered
to
be
units
until
they
hit
the
ground
-
and
thus
will
interact
with
Wind
Wall
while
en
route.
The
following
projectiles
pass
through
Wind
Wall
(possible
bugs):
Nautilus's
Depth
Charge
(visually
it
travels
under
the
ground)
Xerath's
Rite
of
the
Arcane
(visually,
the
blasts

Details
Sweeping
Blade
is
a
targeted,
fixed-length
dash
.
Applies
spell
effects
as
a
single
target
ability.
Spell
vamp
is
fully

Rylai's

a

Magic

Spell

will

the
ability.
Additional
Information:
Yasuo
can
pass
through
terrain
both
before
and
after
he's
hit
his
target
-
permitting
sufficient
space
for
him
to
make
the
jump.
Uniquely,
all
forms
of
movement-inhibiting
crowd
control
(airborne,
snares,
stuns,
suppression,
etc)
will
interrupt
Sweeping
Blade
when
they
hit
him
-
rather
than
waiting
for
him
to
complete
the
dash.
This
is
contrary
to
all
other
dashes,
which
are
only
interrupted
by
airborne-type
crowd
control
effects.
The
cooldown
of
Sweeping
Blade
is
unaffected
by
cooldown
reduction.

Ability
Details
Last
Breath
is
an
auto-targeted
ability
that
can
only
be
activated
if
there
is
an
airborne
enemy
champion
nearby.
The
cursor's
current
position
will
influence
the
ability's
auto-targeting,
although
it
is
not
technically
using
Quick
cast
and
having
your
cursor
near
a
valid
target
is
not
required
to
activate
the
ability.
Applies
spell
effects
as
an
area
of
effect
ability.
Spell
vamp
is
reduced
to
one-third
effectiveness.
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
will
apply
a
15%
slow.
Spell
shields
will
block
the
ability.
Additional
Information:
Bonus
armor
refers
to
all
sources
of
armor
beyond
the
target's
base
armor
and
armor
per
level.
Bonus
armor
refers
specifically
to
armor
granted
through:
runes,
masteries,
items,
auras/buffs
and
champion
abilities.
The
bonus
armor
penetration
applies
before
percentage
armor
penetration.
Using
Last
Whisper
as
an
example:
"Subtract
half
the
enemy's
bonus
armor,
then
subtract
35%
of
the
total
remaining
armor."

Note
that
"Airborne"
is
a
classification
of
enemy
enforced
crowd
control
and
not
a
visual
description.
Only
airborne-type
crowd
control
sourced
from
an
enemy
champion
will
count
for
the
purposes
of
Last
Breath.
Jumps
,
including
abilities
recognized
as
self-CC
,
do
not
classify
the
unit
as
being
Airborne.
Bouncing
animations,
such
as
Zac
during
Let's
Bounce!
,
do
not
classify
the
unit
as
being
Airborne
(though
the
enemy
targets
he
hits
with
it
are
knocked
Airborne
and
will
function
with
Last
Breath).
