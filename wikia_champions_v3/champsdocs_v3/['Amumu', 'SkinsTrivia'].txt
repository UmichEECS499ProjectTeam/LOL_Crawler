Trivia
Amumu
was
designed
by
Ezreal
.
Amumu
is
voiced
by
Cristina
Ulloa,
Who
also
voices
Annie
and
Nunu
.
The
icon
for
Bandage
Toss
is
a
reference
to
Spiderman
from
Marvel
Comics
.
Amumu
was
one
of
the
champions
available
for
the
Ionian
pool
during
the
Ionia
vs.
Noxus
match
,
and
was
one
of
the
selected
champions.
Amumu
is
seen
on
a
caution
sign
in
the
Mac
Version
of
League
of
Legends
preview
video.
Amumu
is
the
third
champion
to
have
7
skins.
Amumu's
dance
is
a
reference
to
the
television
show
South
Park
,
in
which
the
Gothic
kids
would
dance
by
shuffling
from
side
to
side,
and
take
a
smoke
from
their
cigarette
every
second
time
they
turned.
A
side-by-side
comparison
can
be
viewed
here
.
Both
dances
are,
in
turn,
parodies
of
the
classic
"Peanut's
Dance",
which
is
the
bizarre
shuffling
dance
performed
by
the
characters
of
the
Peanuts
comic.
His
name
is
a
pun
on
"A
mummy".
When
Amumu
dies,
his
pose
is
that
of
an
egiptian
mummy
with
the
arms
crossed
right
over
left.
Him
having
his
arms
crossed
this
way
might
mean
he
is
from
royal
descent.
Skins
In
his
classic
skin
Amumu
is
creating
a
magical
image
of
his
parents
,
which
look
human,
despite
he
is
clearly
a
yordle
.
It
could
be
that
he's
just
replicating
what
"parents"
might
look
like,
as
he
has
no
memory
of
his
own.
In
the
Emumu
skin,
the
background
posters
are
a
parody
of
several
well-known
bands:
"Death
Cab
for
Corki"
for
Death
Cab
for
Cutie
,
"Cho'Gath
Eat
World"
for
Jimmy
Eat
World
and
"Anivinescence"
for
Evanescence
.
The
sad-face
poster
is
a
parody
of
Nirvana's
symbol,
which
is
a
happy
face.
In
the
background
of
the
Chinese
Emumu
skin,
a
ghost
Tristana
is
playing
a
bass
and
a
ghost
Poppy
is
playing
drums.
Riot
created
a
flash
minigame
called
Cho'Gath
Eats
the
World
.
The
Classic
Amumu
artwork
is
used
by
The
Tribunal
to
indicate
an
error.
Vancouver
Amumu
is
a
reference
to
the
Vancouver
2010
Olympic
Winter
Games
.
Almost-Prom
King
Amumu
and
Prom
Queen
Annie
share
a
Prom
skin
theme.
Little
Knight
Amumu
is
a
reference
to
The
Sword
in
the
Stone
from
Arthurian
legend,
only
instead
of
removing
the
sword
from
the
stone,
Amumu
breaks
it.
The
skin
was
an
idea
from
the
Riot
staffer
Nikasaur
,
her
first
skin
idea,
as
revealed
here
In
the
Chinese
artwork,
Amumu
is
shown
with
the
sword
in
one
piece,
and
he
wields
it
against
Warwick
.
If
you
look
closely
behind
him,
you
can
see
a
passed
out
girl
that
bears
a
strong
resemblance
to
Annie
,
one
of
his
close
friends.
Sad
Robot
Amumu
might
be
a
reference
to
Marvin
the
Paranoid
Android
of
the
novel:
The
Hitchhiker's
Guide
to
the
Galaxy.
It
also
bears
a
striking
resemblence
to
Robot
Jones
off
the
show
"Whatever
Happenned
To
Robot
Jones".
It
might
also
be
a
reference
to
Chibi
Robo
,
due
to
the
outlet
that
he
drags
along
The
skin's
laugh
was
bugged
upon
release
and
could
be
heard
globally
by
both
allies
and
enemies.
This
however
has
been
fixed.
The
skin
replaces
the
glyphs
along
the
rim
of
Curse
of
the
Sad
Mummy
with
various
sad
face
emoticons
such
as
DX,
T_T,
Q_Q,
:\,
Ò_Ó,
etc.
[1]
Relations
Amumu
joined
the
League
as
a
champion,
which
has
given
him
the
thing
he
desired:
a
home.
With
his
present
(un)life
secured,
he
now
hopes
the
friends
he
has
made
will
help
him
discover
his
past.
Amumu
is
a
good
friend
of
Annie
.
Regarding
Amumu,
Ezreal
states,
"Things
are
bad
when
Amumu
is
crying,
but
they're
much
worse
when
he's
angry."
During
a
contagion
outbreak
at
the
Institute
of
War
,
Amumu
can
be
seen
being
administered
a
mandatory
shot
from
Akali
.
