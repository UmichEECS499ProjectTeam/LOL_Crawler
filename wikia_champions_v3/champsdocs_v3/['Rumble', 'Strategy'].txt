Skill
usage
It's
important
to
keep
a
close
eye
on
your
heat
gauge
whenever
casting,
with
the
exception
of
The
Equalizer
.
All
of
Rumble's
abilities
are
stronger
from
50%
heat
to
99%
heat,
but
overheating
(at
100%
heat)
will
silence
you.
Spam
Flamespitter
at
the
beginning
of
the
game
to
get
in
the
danger
zone,
increasing
your
damage.
Enemies
who
do
not
have
vision
on
Rumble
will
not
see
Flamespitter
's
animation,
but
they
will
see
their
health
bar
depleting.
Use
this
to
potentially
harras
from
one
edge
of
top
or
bot
lane
bush
to
another.
The
bonus
damage
on
Junkyard
Titan
can
be
just
enough
for
the
kill,
but
be
careful,
because
if
you
were
relying
on
one
of
his
standard
abilities
to
help
you
pick
up
the
kill,
the
silence
due
to
overheating
can
end
up
denying
you
a
kill.
Consider
leveling
Scrap
Shield
for
a
low
cooldown
movement
speed
boost,
and
an
effective
clutch
shield.
You
can
also
use
it
to
always
stay
above
50%
heat.
Electro-Harpoon
and
The
Equalizer
help
to
keep
foes
within
range
of
your
Flamespitter
.
The
Equalizer
receives
no
benefit
from
being
cast
above
50%
heat,
so
it
can
be
wise
to
cast
early
so
that
you
don't
risk
being
overheated
when
you
really
need
The
Equalizer
.
Proper
placement
of
The
Equalizer
can
completely
change
a
teamfight.
Depending
on
where
it
is
placed,
Rumble
can
punish
enemies
attempting
to
enter
a
teamfight,
damage
most
enemies
already
within
the
teamfight
or
cut
off
the
escape
route
of
enemies
wishing
to
exit
the
teamfight.
When
casting
The
Equalizer
,
note
that
the
point
from
which
the
cursor
is
dragged
will
become
one
end
of
the
trail.
The
Equalizer
has
a
very
large
casting
radius.
Rumble
can
often
surprise
enemies
by
casting
it
from
behind
a
wall.
Scrap
Shield
and
Electro-Harpoon
both
have
utility
for
chasing/escaping.
Allowing
you
to
chase/escape
with
Scrap
Shield
while
shooting
your
Electro-Harpoon
while
your
enemy
is
running
away
from
you
or
towards
you.
Build
usage
Rumble
is
one
of
the
few
"mage"
type
units
whose
standard
attack
is
a
melee
range
attack
which
will
put
him
in
harm's
way
very
often.
Buying
items
that
increase
health
like
Haunting
Guise
and
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
or
increase
resistances
like
Abyssal
Scepter
and
Zhonya's
Hourglass
can
be
very
helpful.
Scrap
Shield
increases
your
effective
health
(and
scales
with
ability
power
)
so
buying
items
that
increase
your
resistances
(and
ability
power
)
like
Abyssal
Scepter
and
Zhonya's
Hourglass
can
improve
its
effectiveness.
Since
The
Equalizer
and
Flamespitter
do
damage
the
longer
an
enemy
stays
within
them,
a
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
can
help
prevent
foes
from
moving
out
of
Rumble
's
damaging
AoE
.
Because
Rumble
scales
so
well
with
ability
power
,
Rabadon's
Deathcap
is
highly
beneficial
to
him.
The
bonus
damage
from
Junkyard
Titan
has
a
0.25
ability
power
ratio
per
attack.
If
you
find
yourself
relying
on
Junkyard
Titan
for
damage
output,
building
lots
of
ability
power
with
some
attack
speed
will
augment
your
damage
output
while
giving
you
ability
power
and
magic
resistance
reduction
for
your
abilities.
Spell
vamp
items
like
Hextech
Revolver
and
Will
of
the
Ancients
help
Rumble
stay
in
lane
longer.
Although
Rumble
could
benefit
from
cooldown
reduction
,
very
few
cooldown
reduction
items
have
any
synergy
with
him.
However,
Ionian
Boots
of
Lucidity
and
Nashor's
Tooth
are
beneficial.
Once
Rumble
buys
a
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
,
a
Liandry's
Torment
is
a
very
smart
idea
as
the
burn
damage
from
it
will
always
be
doubled.
This
also
allows
you
to
go
down
a
tankier
route
with
liandrys
as
your
main
source
of
damage.

Countering
Rumble
deals
primarily
magic
damage
.
Get
magic

items
to
reduce

damage
output.
In

try
to
wait
until
Rumble
uses
Flamespitter
and/or
Scrap
Shield
before
taking
the
offensive.
This
will
help
tilt
skirmishes
in
your
favor.
Flamespitter
is
a
powerful
zoning
tool
but
it
pushes
the
lane,
so
try
to
get
an
ally
to
help
gank
Rumble
.
Moving
away
from
his
The
Equalizer
can
be
critical
to
your
survival.
Avoid
tight
paths
which
will
make
moving
away
from
it
impossible
along
the
path.
Remember
that
it
has
a
very
high
potential
range.
Be
careful
after
avoiding
his
Electro-Harpoon
,
as
he
can
still
fire
another
one
even
if
he
overheats.
