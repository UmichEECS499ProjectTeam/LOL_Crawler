Skill
usage
If
Dredge
Line
deals
the
killing
blow,
it
will
drag
Nautilus
to
where
the
target
was
upon
death,
as
if
the
skill
had
hit
terrain.
Titan's
Wrath
and
Riptide
are
excellent
farming
tools
when
used
together,
as
they
each
deal
a
good
amount
of
area
of
effect
damage.
Titan's
Wrath
resets
your
autoattack
timer,
so
timing
it
right
after
a
basic
attack
can
allow
for
a
quick
second
hit.
Despite
Titan's
Wrath
bonus
on-hit
damage
will
be
lost
upon
depletion
or
expiry
of
the
shield,
if
Nautilus'
attack
animation
is
in
first
half
of
modified
animation,
his
next
hit
will
trigger
the
on-hit
magic
DoT
as
well.
If
you
are
farming
minions,
Staggering
Blow
can
be
a
great
tool
to
increase
your
last-hitting
capabilities
due
to
its
free
bonus-damage.
Be
careful
when
chasing
an
enemy
under
the
turret
with
Dredge
Line
.
If
you
miss
and
hit
the
turret,
you'll
end
up
horribly
off
position.
Be
sure
about
your
position
while
using
Riptide
.
You
must
be
close
enough
to
catch
the
opponent
because
this
spell
is
pretty
slow
in
animation.
The
range
on
Dredge
Line
is
a
bit
further
than
the
indicator
shows.
Experiment
on
terrain
to
see
how
far
you
can
be
to
proc
the
skill
shot.
Dredge
Line
is
a
fantastic
method
of
travel,
especially
at
higher
levels.
When
running
around
between
lanes,
use
it
on
terrain
to
pull
yourself
along
faster.
The
same
goes
for
fleeing;
if
a
fight
goes
bad,
run
for
the
nearest
turret
or
open
terrain,
and
pull
yourself
to
it
for
a
quick
escape.
For
a
quick
start
after
recalling
or
respawning,
latch
on
to
your
nexus.
To
perfrom
the
highest
crowd
control/burst
combo
on
a
target
send
Depth
Charge
after
them.
Right
when
the
opponent
is
in
landing
back
to
the
ground
follow
up
with
an
easy
Dredge
Line
and
a
mid-air
Riptide
to
ensure
a
second
explosios
hit.
Finally
hit
them
for
Staggering
Blow
and
use
Titan's
Wrath
for
the
autoattack
rest,
bonus
damage
and
absorving
counter-attack
Mark
squishy/high
priority
targets
with
Depth
Charge
in
order
to
give
your
team
a
good
chance
to
kill
them.
It's
also
useful
for
stopping
channels,
such
as
Katarina's
Death
Lotus
.
Also,
the
squishy
targets
tend
to
be
at
the
back
their
team
so
you'll
be
able
to
hit
their
entire
team
with
the
pass
through
damage
instead
of
only
one
target
with
the
explosion
damage
Remember
that
Staggering
Blow
is
an
immobilization,
which
means
it
does
nothing
to
stop
channeled
ultimates.
Dredge
Line
can
stop
channeled
abilities
like
Warwick's
Infinite
Duress
.
Attack
speed
can
speed
up
jungling
by
increasing
the
amount
of
damage
your
Titan's
Wrath
does
over
time,
since
each
attack
immediately
applies
the
first
tick
of
the
damage
over
time.
Nautilus
can
jungle
because
Titan's
Wrath
and
Riptide
are
extremely
effective
for
clearing
out
minion
camps.
Build
usage
Building
resistances
will
generally
give
your
shield
more
effective
health
than
building
health,
despite
the
health
ratio
on
it.
Abyssal
Scepter
helps
both
in
tanking
and
increasing
your
damage
especially
since
Nautilus
is
such
a
good
initiator
and
often
in
the
middle
of
the
enemy
team's
zone
in
fights.
Nautilus
has
really
high
ability
power
ratios
for
a
tank,
making
one
or
two
tanky
mage
items
desirable
on
him.
Rod
of
Ages
offers
a
good
deal
of
health
and
ability
power.
It's
build
path
item
Catalyst
the
Protector
solves
Nautilus
mana
problems
when
he
does
not
have
the
Crest
of
the
Ancient
Golem
On
games
when
you
are
far
ahead
you
can
consider
odd
item
picks
like
Zhonya's
Hourglass
or
Morellonomicon
just
to
furtherly
stoomp
over
your
weakeaned
enemy
team.
It's
worth
noting
that
Nautilus
gets
outrageously
bursty
with
some
ability
power
While
Warmog's
Armor
does
increase
the
damage
amount
absorbed
by
Titan's
Wrath
,
it
doesn't
increase
your
overall
damage
output,
making
the
enemy
less
likely
to
focus
you
during
fights.
Frozen
Mallet
or
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
can
be
an
effective
alternatives
as
the
slows
can
help
you
get
more
Staggering
Blow
hits.
Iceborn
Gauntlet
offer
a
lot
of
different
stats
all
of
which
Nautilus
really
likes.
The
slow
field
that
creates
adds
even
more
distruption
and
crowd
control
to
Nautilus
alredy
overloaded
kit,
making
it
very
desiable.
Randuin's
Omen
gives
a
lot
of
health
a
world
of
armor
and
gifts
Nautilus
with
an
extra
CC
abbility
to
use
while
he
is
suffering
from
his
long
cooldowns.
Nautilus
depends
greatly
on
his
abilities
to
deal
damage
so
building
CDR
to
counter
his
large
cooldowns
will
allow
you
to
do
great
amounts
of
damage
to
the
enemy
team.
Allowing
him
to
get
really
tanky
while
solving
his
cooldownish
problems
Spirit
Visage
and
Frozen
Heart
are
simply
perfect,
not
to
mention
that
their
build
paths
are
really
easy
and
alredy
give
useful
stats
Fiendish
Codex
and
its
upgrades
greatly
benefit
a
more
damage-oriented
style
of
gameplay.

Countering
Titan's
Wrath
has
a
very
long
CD
time,
especially
early
before
Nautilus
gets
it
to
high
levels
and
has
more
CDR.
Try
running
out
the
clock
on
the
ability,
then
hit
him
during
that
cooldown
window.
Titan's
Wrath
can
add
up
to
significant
damage
over
the
course
of
a
team
fight.
Consider
diverting
a
couple
of
attacks
to
break
the
shield
when
you
see
him
use
it.
Nautilus
can
be
used
as
a
CC
heavy
support
like
Leona
with
a
harder
to
land
initiation
but
with
more
damage
and
CC
,
getting
caught
by
his
combo
and
his
lane
partner
can
be
even
deadlier
than
getting
grabbed
by
Blitzcrank.
Nautilus
is
one
of
the
few
tanks
that
has
strong
magic
damage,
so
consider
building
magic
resistance
.
While
Nautilus
has
burst
damage,
this
is
moot
when
his
abilities
are
on
cooldown.
Try
to
engage
him
after
he
has
used
several
abilities.
Dredge
Line
draws
Nautilus
to
terrain,
so
when
running
from
him,
try
and
stay
away
from
terrain,
or
a
miss
may
still
bring
him
closer.
With
enough
ability
power
Nautilus
can
burst
down
a
squishy
target
(ADC
,
APC)
like
a
mage
,
but
including
an
overwhelming
amount
of
CC
He
will
combo
with
Dredge
Line
,
followed
by
Riptide
(that
will
likely
hit
twice)
,
all
while
he
has
his
shield
up,
and
finish
the
it
landing
an
an
unavoidable
Depth
Charge
,
that
has
even
more
harsher
CC
and
a
devastating
blow
of
damage.
Nautilus
will
think
twice
of
following
the
attack
if
you
avoid
Dredge
Line
,
as
it
will
be
much
harder
for
him
to
combo
,
and
Dredge
Line
has
quite
a
damaging
blow
,
that
Nautilus
can't
hope
to
miss,
as
he
is
just
left
with
Depth
Charge
to
close
the
gap
,
and
loosing
a
significant
amount
of
damage.
Nautilus
has
early
mana
problems
,
force
him
to
overuse
his
abilities.
Stand
still
when
he
uses
his
Riptide
to
prevent
the
extra
magic
damage
the
spell
deals
when
it
moves.
Even
standing
still
it's
very
likely
to
get
hit
by
two
explosions
if
you
are
using
any
champion
bigger
than
Teemo
or
Lulu
Getting
hit
by
3
explosions
is
impossible
if
you
are
still
but
almost
confirmed
to
hit
if
you
are
moving.
