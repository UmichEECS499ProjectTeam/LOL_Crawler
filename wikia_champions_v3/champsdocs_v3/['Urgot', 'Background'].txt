Background

&
Trivia
Lore
There
are
warriors
who
become
great
for
their
strength,
cunning,
or
skill
with
arms.
Others
simply
refuse
to
die.
Urgot,
once
a
great
soldier
of
Noxus
,
may
constitute
a
case
in
support
of
the
latter.
Prone
to
diving
headlong
into
enemy
battle
lines,
Urgot
sowed
chaos
throughout
the
enemy
ranks,
often
sustaining
grievous
injuries
in
the
process.
When
his
body
was
unable
to
weather
further
abuse,
the
crippled
Urgot
was
delegated
the
position
of
High
Executioner
of
Noxus.
By
this
time,
his
hands
had
been
ruined
and
he
could
barely
walk.
Scythe-like
grafts
affixed
to
his
maimed
limbs
served
to
carry
out
his
bloody
work.
Urgot
finally
met
his
end
at
what
should
have
been
his
finest
hour.
Because
of
his
military
background,
he
often
accompanied
detachments
into
foreign
territory
to
carry
out
judgment.
After
ambushing
an
enemy
force,
Jarvan
IV,
the
Crown
Prince
of
Demacia
,
fell
into
the
clutches
of
Urgot's
division.
Too
far
from
Noxus
to
risk
transporting
their
prize
for
ransom,
Urgot
prepared
to
dispose
of
their
captive.
At
the
final
moment,
however,
the
Dauntless
Vanguard,
led
by
Garen,
the
Might
of
Demacia
,
intervened,
and
Urgot
was
cut
in
two
by
the
zealous
warrior
as
he
scrambled
to
free
his
Prince.
In
recognition
of
his
service,
the
executioner's
remains
were
remanded
to
the
Bleak
Academy
for
reanimation.
A
lifetime
of
abuse,
however,
had
left
his
body
in
a
catastrophic
state;
proving
problematic
to
the
necromancers'
craft.
Professor
Stanwick
Pididly,
the
prevailing
scholar
of
Zaun
,
offered
a
solution.
Within
Pididly's
laboratories,
a
nightmarish
new
body
was
forged
for
Urgot.
Now
as
much
machine
as
man,
Urgot
arrived
at
the
League
of
Legends
in
search
of
the
man
who
ended
his
life;
necromantic
energies
coursing
through
his
metal
veins.
"We
can
rebuild
him.
We
have
the
techmaturgy."
―
Professor
Stanwick

CLE
OBSERVATION
Urgot
shambles
along
the
great
hall
of
the
Institute
of
War,
spider-like
legs
ferrying
his
bloated,
bulbous
body
towards
his
ultimate
goal.
The
scrape
of
metal
against
marble
and
the
dull
crackle
of
energy
mark
his
passage
as
he
moves
with
deceptive
agility.
His
horrid
emotionless
visage
belies
the
conviction
in
his
gaze.
From
his
right
arm
swings
a
wicked-looking
blade,
beginning
where
the
hand
should
have
been.
His
left
arm
terminates
in
a
cannon,
a
similarly
poor
replacement
for
the
extremity.
He
creaks
to
a
halt
before
a
pair
of
ornate
marble
doors.
He
lifts
one
of
his
segmented
metal
legs,
extending
it
forward
to
deal
with
the
blocking
portal,
which
slides
open
easily
at
his
touch.
His
scarred,
patchwork
skin
-
blanched
in
the
eerie
glow
of
the
techmaturgical
engine
that
sustains
him
-
glistens
with
beads
of
sweat
as
he
scuttles
inside.
REFLECTION
The
darkness
around
him
grew
heavy
and
familiar.
He
could
feel
the
dew
on
his
scalp
as
a
stiff
breeze
crossed
over
him.
His
whole
body
trembled,
but
there
was
no
fear
in
it.
Only
the
anticipation
of
what
was
to
come.
Urgot
wrung
his
fingers
around
the
shaft
of
his
axe.
His
fingers!
He
lifted
a
hand
in
front
of
his
face.
As
his
eyes
adjusted
to
the
darkness,
he
stared
in
disbelief
at
the
sight
of
his
own,
unspoiled
digits.
Just
beyond
them
he
recognized
the
dour
face
of
Sion,
his
commanding
officer,
a
whistle
pinched
between
his
lips.
An
arc
of
lightning
lit
the
sky,
its
brilliance
revealing
a
distant
silhouette.
Thunder
followed
a
few
seconds
later.
Could
it
be?
Could
he
be
here,
now?
The
shrill
squeal
of
his
commander's
whistle
wrenched
him
from
his
contemplations.
Almost
involuntarily,
he
broke
into
a
charge,
dashing
headlong
towards
his
distant
adversary.
"Gatecrashers!"
he
heard
someone
cry.
"Form
up,
men!"
Ahead,
he
could
see
the
soldiers
forming
ranks,
a
wall
of
Demacian
shields
waiting
to
meet
the
charge.
Something
was
wrong.
There
were
too
many.
Without
breaking
stride
be
brought
his
greataxe
around,
sundering
the
lead
enemy's
shield
and
toppling
him
backward.
Urgot
waded
in
-
oblivious
to
the
danger
-
swinging
the
weapon
in
wide
arcs
to
broaden
the
hole
in
his
enemy's
defenses.
The
sounds
of
combat
filled
the
air
as
chaos
erupted
about
him.
For
an
instant,
the
Demacians
were
staggered,
offering
him
a
moment's
reprieve.
A
fresh
wound
leaked
blood
into
his
eyes,
and
he
smeared
it
away
as
he
peered
through
the
havoc.
Another
bolt
of
lightning
revealed
a
resolute,
armored
form
to
the
rear
of
the
vanguard
who
was
shouting
orders
while
steadying
himself
against
an
ancient
oak.
Urgot
began
moving
once
more,
battleaxe
leading
the
way.
He
hacked
his
way
to
the
back
of
the
enemy
force,
the
cries
of
his
fellows
lending
urgency
to
his
attack.
The
Demacians
were
rallying.
His
comrades
were
being
overwhelmed.
He
lunged
forward
to
intercept
the
enemy
commander,
axe
held
high,
as
he
moved
to
rejoin
the
fray.
His
opponent
darted
to
the
side
and
the
axeblade
bit
firmly
into
the
trunk
of
the
tree.
Urgot
wrenched
wildly,
struggling
to
free
the
stubborn
weapon.
But
it
was
too
late.
There
was
a
flash
of
silver,
and
everything
fell
silent.
His
vision
blurred
as
he
stumbled
backward,
arms
extended
before
him.
The
ruined
appendages
-
ending
just
below
the
wrist
-
burned
white
hot
agony
as
they
issued
forth
a
torrent
of
gore.
"Do
you
remember,
Urgot?"
asked
a
familiar
voice.
Urgot
turned
to
face
who
addressed
him.
The
carnage
around
him
had
vanished,
and
it
was
daybreak
now.
He
was
standing
at
a
clearing
in
the
woods.
He
could
hear
the
birds
chirping
in
the
brisk
morning
air.
Garen,
the
Might
of
Demacia,
stood
a
few
paces
away,
idly
wiping
the
blood
from
his
sword.
"I
remember,
Demacian,"
croaked
the
maimed
warrior,
stoically,
"I
remember
what
you
have
done
to
me."
A
wicked
smile
curled
at
the
edge
of
Garen's
lips.
"It
is
not
over,"
he
mocked.
In
the
blink
of
an
eye
he
was
gone,
replaced
by
a
cheering
crowd
of
Noxian
warriors.
Urgot's
mutilated
right
arm
now
ended
in
a
vicious
looking
glaive,
a
gift
from
a
field
surgeon.
He
looked
down.
At
his
feet,
bound
prostrate
in
the
dirt,
was
a
handsome,
blonde
haired
youth.
Jarvan
IV,
the
Crown
Prince
of
Demacia
stared
up
at
him,
piercing
blue
eyes
locked
on
his
executioner
without
fear.
Though
he
was
defeated,
the
air
of
pride
and
dignity
about
him
could
not
be
tempered.
Urgot
wore
a
self-satisfied
grin
as
he
raised
his
arm
to
strike
the
fatal
stroke.
An
arrow
caught
him
in
the
chest,
staying
his
hand.
He
gasped
in
pain,
looking
up
just
in
time
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
that
same
armored
figure
closing
in
on
him
with
uncanny
speed,
weapon
raised
menacingly.
He
plummeted
to
the
earth,
a
warm
puddle
spreading
rapidly
beneath
him
with
each
slow,
deafening
beat
of
his
heart.
He
felt
to
scream,
but
could
not
find
his
breath.
This
could
not
be
the
end!
Not
like
this!
This
was
his
moment.
Not
like
this!
Blackness
closed
in
around
him,
leaving
him
alone
with
his
killer.
"Why
do
you
want
to
join
the
League,
Urgot?"
asked
Garen,
leaning
heavily
on
his
sword.
Urgot's
labored
gasps
ceased.
He
was
whole
once
more,
his
metal
legs
creaking
as
he
quivered
with
rage.
Necromantic
energy
raced
along
his
metallic
spine.
"Revenge!"
he
roared,
eyes
ablaze
with
hatred.
Garen
nodded,
taking
a
step
closer.
"How
does
it
feel,
exposing
your
mind?"
In
response,
Urgot
raised
his
mighty
glaive
over
his
head
and
brought
it
down
furiously
on
the
image
of
his
nemesis.
He
found
only
the
open
air
as
the
phantom
dissolved
into
the
dark.
The
great
doors
before
him
flew
open.
The
League
was
waiting.

The
Champion
was
officially
revealed
first
in
the
Issue
3
of
The
Journal
of
Justice.
[1]
Then
it
was
announced
in
the
Official
forums:
Some
stories
bring
new
meaning
to
the
phrase:
"cautionary
tale,"
and
I'm
pretty
sure
that
this
one
qualifies.
Meet
Urgot,
the
Headman's
Pride.
As
you
might
be
able
to
tell,
this
bloke's
seen
a
few
scrapes
in
his
life
and,
by
this
point,
is
a
bit
the
worse
for
wear.
While
he
may
not
be
winning
any
beauty
contests,
you're
really
got
to
admit
it,
the
guy's
got
style.
Unless,
of
course,
you’re
an
arachnophobe.
Then
the
two
of
you
might
have
issues.
Be
on
the
lookout
for
Urgot
as
he
scuttles
his
way
onto
the
Field
of
Justice
in
the
coming
patch.
