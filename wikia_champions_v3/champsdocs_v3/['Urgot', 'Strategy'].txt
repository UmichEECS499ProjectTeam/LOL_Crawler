Skill

Zaun-Touched
Bolt
Augmenter
is
a
strong
debuff
that
can
save
your
team
from
a
lot
of
damage.
Apply
it
liberally
to
enemy
champions
when
fighting.
Zaun-Touched
Bolt
Augmenter
makes
Urgot
hard
to
kill
in
a
1v1
fight,
especially
if
he
is
built
tanky.
Try
to
apply
Zaun-Touched
Bolt
Augmenter
on
an
enemy
carry
during
a
teamfight
to
reduce
their
overall
damage
output.
When
farming,
time
the
activation
of
your
Acid
Hunter
s
so
that
you
fire
it
in
between
your
autoattacks.
That
way,
you
farm
as
efficiently
as
possible
and
you
can
also
push
the
lane
very
fast
this
way.
If
no
enemies
are
nearby,
begin
farming
a
creep
wave
by
hitting
the
back
line
of
enemy
minions
with
Noxian
Corrosive
Charge
and
let
the
corrosion
deal
it's
full
damage
to
the
minions
while
you
destroy
the
close-attacking
minions
with
your
autoattacks
and
Acid
Hunters
.
Prior
to
firing
Acid
Hunter
,
try
hovering
over
an
enemy
afflicted
by
Noxian
Corrosive
Charge
.
Upon
launching,
the
Acid
Hunter
will
ignore
all
other
enemies
and
fly
directly
to
the
corroding
target.
A
locked-on
Acid
Hunter
has
incredible
range
and
can
hit
even
if
the
target
is
not
visible
to
you,
being
in
brush,
the
fog
of
war
and
even
in
stealth.
Acid
Hunter
can
hit
through
walls,
giving
an
unexpected
attack
with
a
suprising
amount
of
damage.
Acid
Hunter
has
good
range
and
hits
unarmored
targets
hard
even
when
not
locked-on.
Getting
in
the
habit
of
using
the
skill
shot
occasionally,
even
when
Noxian
Corrosive
Charge
isn't
necessary
applied,
helps
to
throw
enemies
off
of
their
rhythm
and
makes
you
a
threat
even
when
your
lock-on
fails
or
wears
off.
The
Crest
of
the
Ancient
Golem
will
dramatically
improve
Urgot's
fighting
ability
if
he
gets
it;
the
high
mana
regeneration
lend
itself
to
constant
Acid
Hunter
barrages,
while
the
cooldown
reduction
allows
him
to
lock
on
targets
with
Noxian
Corrosive
Charge
more
frequently.
You
will
only
slow
enemies
as
long
as
your
shield
remains
active,
so
consider
putting
ranks
into
Terror
Capacitor
to
provide
Urgot
with
a
crippling
slow,
better
chances
of
maintaining
it
and
greater
durability
in
skirmishes.
Using
Terror
Capacitor
with
Acid
Hunter
can
allow
you
to
quickly
catch
fleeing
opponents
or
deter
individual
pursuers.
Noxian
Corrosive
Charge
is
capable
of
revealing
the
fog
of
war
.
Use
it
to
scout
without
risk.
His
Hyper-Kinetic
Position
Reverser
should
be
used
to
pull
enemies
right
into
ganks
and
towers,
but
it
also
has
a
use
in
escaping
should
your
escape
path
be
blocked
by
an
enemy.
Whenever
there
are
any
squishy
targets
on
the
other
team,
use
Hyper-Kinetic
Position
Reverser
to
swap
them
into
your
team
to
get
an
easy
kill.
Remember
that
although
Hyper-Kinetic
Position
Reverser
grants
armor
and
magic
resist,
you
are
not
invincible.
Take
note
of
nearby
towers
or
enemy
champions
that
can
burst
you
down
before
its
channel
is
complete.
Hyper-Kinetic
Position
Reverser
suppresses
the
target
while
channeling,
so
it
can
be
used
for
deterring
an
enemy's
escape
for
your
team
to
finish
off
your
target.
It
can
also
be
used
to
interrupt
your
enemies'
channeled
spells,
such
as
Katarina
's
Death
Lotus
.
Urgot's
skillset
makes
him
most
effective
in
eliminating
the
enemy
team's
carries,
but
don't
overestimate
his
toughness.
In
general,
it
is
a
good
idea
to
keep
your
distance
from
DPS
champions
until
they
have
been
weakened
or
separated.
Urgot's
Hyper-Kinetic
Position
Reverser
can
be
used
over
walls
to
pull
an
enemy
through
it,
provided
that
he
can
see
the
enemy.
This
can
be
used
offensively
and
defensively
either
when
you
are
being
chased,
ganking
in
the
jungle,
or
caught
in
a
teamfight.
Urgot
is
great
at
harassing.
Use
the
long
range
and
reasonably
wide
area
of
effect
of
noxian
corrosive
charge
to
weaken
enemy
champions
with
impunity
while
simultaneously
farming.
One
strategy
to
take
down
an
enemy
champion
as
Urgot
is
to
conserve
your
abilities
for
chasing.
As
soon
as
your
target
begin
retreating,
pop
your
shield
and
keep
hitting
them
with
as
many
autoattacks
as
you
can
until
Terror
Capacitor
's
time
limit
is
almost
up,
then
catch
your
victim
with
Noxian
Corrosive
Charge
and
follow
up
by
striking
with
as
many
Acid
Hunter
s
as
you
can
before
your
opponent
is
out
of
range.
Urgot's
passive
damage
reduction
from
Zaun-Touched
Bolt
Augmenter
,
extra
survivability
from
Terror
Capacitor
,
and
the
armor
reduction
from
Noxian
Corrosive
Charge
make
it
extremely
difficult
for
opponents
to
gauge
his
strength,
frequently
causing
enemies
to
trade
blows
with
Urgot
and
usually
take
more
damage.
Don't
overestimate
your
foe's
intelligence
or
you
will
miss
opportunities
to
take
them
out
when
they
make
this
common
mistake.
Build
usage
Stacking
high
amounts
of
attack
damage
on
Urgot
will
make
his
Acid
Hunter
and
basic
attacks
more
powerful.
Manamune
is
a
great
first
item
on
Urgot
since
it
gives
him
attack
damage
and
helps
solve
his
mana
problems.
Later
in
the
game,
Muramana
provides
more
damage
to
his
Acid
Hunter
,
especially
if
Urgot
chooses
to
build
more
mana
with
items
like
Frozen
Heart
.
The
Brutalizer
is
a
fantastic
early
item
on
Urgot
since
attack
damage,
armor
penetration
,
and
cooldown
reduction
are
the
exact
things
he
needs
to
increase
his
damage,
which
is
strongest
early/mid
game.
The
Black
Cleaver
has
great
synergy
with
Urgot
's
Noxian
Corrosive
Charge
because
the
damage
over
time
ticks
will
apply
The
Black
Cleaver
's
armor
shred.
The
Bloodthirster
is
a
good
late-game
item
since
life
steal
is
valuable
to
boost
survivability.
Other
standard
attack
damage
items
such
as
Infinity
Edge
are
not
as
effective
since
Urgot's
main
damage
source,
Acid
Hunter
,
cannot
crit
and
does
not
apply
on-hit
effects.
Last
Whisper
is
also
a
good
late-game
item
if
the
enemy
team
is
building
armor
to
counter
you.
Urgot
can
be
mana-hungry
in
the
early
laning
stage,
but
buying
Tear
of
the
Goddess
should
eliminate
mana
problems
for
the
rest
of
the
game.
If
you
decide
not
to
focus
your
build
around
picking
up
the
Manamune
early,
other
mana
regeneration
sources
are
recommended.
Guardian
Angel
can
be
an
effective
defensive
item
for
Urgot
as
his
Terror
Capacitor
can
offer
the
additional
time
necessary
for
a
last
escape,
or
give
you
time
for
cooldowns
to
refresh
so
you
can
quickly
focus
down
low
health
enemies
who
linger
nearby.
Trinity
Force
is
a
strong
if
unorthodox
item
on
Urgot
.
Although
it
does
little
for
your
long-range
Acid
Hunter
combo,
Trinity
Force
greatly
increases
his
presence
in
close
combat
due
to
constant
Sheen
procs.
Another
unorthodox
item
late
game
is
Hextech
Gunblade
,
although
very
effective
when
combined
with
Trinity
Force
.
As
Urgot
has
no
natural
sustain
and
life
steal
only
benefits
him
as
fast
as
he
can
attack,
staggering
his
autos
with
Acid
Hunter
will
allow
Urgot
to
maximize
his
healing
(as
Acid
Hunter
benefits
from
full
spell
vamp
),
granting
an
uninterrupted
stream
of
healing,
while
the
Ability
Power
granted
adds
slight
bonuses
to
his
Terror
Capacitor
.
Attack
damage
items
are
worth
buying
for
the
early
phase
of
the
game;
however,
due
to
the
risk
of
using
his
ultimate
in
lategame,
it
is
recommended
to
build
some
survivability
items
afterwards.
Cooldown
reduction
can
let
Urgot
fire
more
locked-on
Acid
Hunter
s
before
the
Noxian
Corrosive
Charge
debuff
fades.
With
no
CDR,
he
can
fire
3
shots
per
lock
on.
With
16.7%
CDR,
he
can
fire
4.
With
37.5%
CDR,
he
can
fire
5.
However,
the
above
values
are
mathematical
and
do
not
take
into
account
input
lag
or
delay.
In
practice,
40%
cooldown
reduction
makes
it
easy
to
shoot
5
Acid
Hunters
per
Noxian
Corrosive
Charge
.
A
combination
of
CDR
masteries
and
items
can
help
you
hit
this
figure.
Some
choices
that
synergize
well
with
Urgot
include
The
Brutalizer
,
Ionian
Boots
of
Lucidity
,
and
Iceborn
Gauntlet
/
Frozen
Heart
.
The
Crest
of
the
Ancient
Golem
will
greatly
help
Urgot
if
he
can
secure
it.
If
you
choose
to
not
upgrade
The
Brutalizer
,
chances
are
you
will
sell
it
in
favor
of
Last
Whisper
later.
An
Elixir
of
Brilliance
is
a
great
substitute
for
the
CDR
loss.
Cooldown
reduction
is
invaluable
for
Urgot's
other
skills
as
well,
granting
more
temporary
durability
through
Terror
Capacitor
and
a
longer
debuff
uptime
for
Noxian
Corrosive
Charge
.
Glacial
Shroud
is
a
effective
mid
game
item
for
Urgot
as
its
armor
helps
him
fight
physical
damage
champions,
while
the
mana
and
cooldown
reduction
help
him
spam
his
Acid
Hunter
and
adds
to
the
damage
from
Manamune
.
Frozen
Heart
is
also
effective
for
the
same
purpose.
The
Iceborn
Gauntlet
gives
Urgot
the
best
of
both
Glacial
Shroud
's
mana
and
cooldown
reduction
and
Sheen
's
procs,
while
also
giving
Urgot
some
AoE
damage
and
a
way
to
almost
permanently
slow
a
close
enemy
champion.
A
few
items,
(
Maw
of
Malmortius
and
Atma's
Impaler
),
that
add
both
attack
damage
and
resistance
can
complement
Urgot's
damage
output
with
improved
survivability.
An
early
Hexdrinker
is
great
because
in
addition
to
improving
Urgot
all
around,
it
can
later
be
upgraded
into
Maw
of
Malmortius
.
Furor
is
a
strong
upgrade
for
Urgot's
boots
as
his
Acid
Hunter
hits
will
proc
its
speed
increase.
This
allows
him
to
kite
and
chase
enemies
very
well.

Countering
Urgot
does
only
physical
damage,
so
getting
armor
items
is
effective
in
mitigating
his
DPS.
Move
erratically
to
avoid
being
hit
by
Noxian
Corrosive
Charge
thus
preventing
lock-on
with
Acid
Hunter
.
Experienced
players
will
often
wait
for
you
to
move
into
position
for
an
attack
or
minion
kill.
Use
feints
to
cause
them
to
misfire.
Champions
with
gap
closing
abilities
can
combat
Urgot
effectively
by
staying
within
close
range
and
timing
their
dash
to
coincide
with
his
Noxian
Corrosive
Charge
.
Urgot
lacks
mobility
and
is
vulnerable
to
champions
with
good
DPS,
especially
those
with
frequent
disables
or
items
such
as
Frozen
Mallet
.
Avoid
commiting
to
a
close
quarters
1v1
battle
with
Urgot
unless
you
are
certain
of
an
overwhelming
victory.
His
abilities
make
it
difficult
to
escape
a
losing
battle.
Urgot
tends
to
be
rather
predictable,
in
that
whenever
he
lands
a
Noxian
Corrosive
Charge
,
he
will
almost
always
chase
the
target
in
order
to
land
his
full
combo.
This
can
be
easily
exploited
to
bait
him
into
overextending
for
a
gank.
Keep
in
mind,
however,
that
after
Urgot
reaches
level
6,
Hyper-Kinetic
Position
Reverser
can
allow
for
an
easy
escape
by
switching
places
with
the
ganking
champion.
Either
make
sure
the
ganking
champion
has
a
way
to
block
or
break
the
suppress,
or
be
prepared
to
interrupt
the
channel.
If
he
is
unable
to
use
his
ultimate
to
escape,
Urgot
is
usually
a
relatively
easy
kill.
Be
mindful
of
Urgot's
ultimate,
as
you
or
your
team
can
quickly
be
pulled
into
danger.
Prevent
this
by
having
spell
block/cancel
items
such
as
Banshee's
Veil
or
Quicksilver
Sash
.
But
remember
that
Banshee's
Veil
block
only
one
ability,
he
can
easily
pop
the
shield
with
Noxian
Corrosive
Charge
or
Acid
Hunter
,
especially
if
you
are
going
to
engage
him
without
anything
between
you
and
him
Although
Quicksilver
Sash
will
remove
the
suppression
from
Hyper-Kinetic
Position
Reverser
,
you
will
still
swap
positions
with
him.
After
removing
the
suppression,
run
towards
your
team
to
put
Urgot
in
an
unfavorable
position.
