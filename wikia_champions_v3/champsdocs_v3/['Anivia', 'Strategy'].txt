usage
It
is
generally
recommended
to
time
Rebirth
while
under
an
allied
tower
or
while
you
have
your
allies
for
protection.
Do
not
count
on
your
egg
too
much
when
you
are
alone
and
not
under
a
tower.
Low-level
enemies
can
kill
you
because
of
the
huge
armor
+
magic
resistance
reduction
and
long
revive
time.
Try
to
be
aggressive
in
teamfights
so
you
can
deal
good
damage;
be
focused
and
let
your
team
do
the
rest
while
they
start
working
on
your
egg.
Rebirth
can
be
used
to
bait
an
enemy
to
commit
to
killing
Anivia
when
your
jungler
ganks
that
lane.
Despite
having
Rebirth
,
Anivia
is
fairly
vulnerable
to
other
harassment.
Heavy
hits
can
severely
cripple
her.
Try
to
stop
harassment
by
stunning
your
opponent
before
they
can
combo
you
to
win
tradeoffs.
Anivia's
basic
combo
is
to
place
Glacial
Storm
,
place
Crystallize
to
block
the
opponent
from
escaping,
and
throw
Flash
Frost
at
in
a
line
towards
the
edge
of
the
wall
to
stun
the
opponent
as
they
try
to
move
then
follow
up
with
a
Frostbite
.
Both
the
damage
from
passing
through
and
the
detonation
of
Flash
Frost
remove
a
spell
shield
from
Banshee's
Veil
.
This
means
if
you
time
it
correctly
and
detonate
Flash
Frost
right
after
it
passed
through
an
enemy
with
Banshee's
Veil
's
spell
shield,
it
will
dissolve
and
the
detonation
will
deal
full
damage,
stunning
the
target.
During
the
laning
phase,
use
your
auto-attacks
to
hide
harassment
attempts.
Stand
within
attack
range
of
an
enemy
champion
and
auto-attack
minions
with
Anivia
.
When
the
enemy
doesn't
expect
it,
launch
a
Flash
Frost
and
charge
straight
at
them;
if
you
time
it
correctly,
they
will
be
chilled
and
stunned,
and
you'll
be
close
enough
to
land
a
follow-up
for
tons
of
damage.
This
is
an
effective
strategy
because
the
start
of
many
of
Anivia
's
spell
animations
look
similar
to
the
beginning
of
her
auto-attack
animation,
and
this
can
often
catch
an
enemy,
expecting
an
auto-attack,
off-guard.
Anivia's
Flash
Frost
explosion
area
of
effect
is
slightly
bigger
than
the
initial
projectile's
area,
so
try
to
hit
the
opponent
twice
with
the
spell
by
detonating
it
after
it
passes
through
them.
Anivia's
wall
has
a
cast
time,
so
be
sure
to
cast
it
WELL
in
front
of
the
opponent.
Just
a
little
in
front
will
block
you
off
and
push
them
away.
In
the
jungle,
the
wall,
Crystallize
can
completely
block
off
a
pathway.
Allies
can
be
blocked
in/out
as
well
so
timing
is
essential.
In
the
jungle,
Crystallize
can
completely
block
the
Ancient
Golem
in
its
area.
This
allows
you
to
kill
it
without
taking
any
damage
as
it
cannot
reach
melee
range
and
attack.
Crystallize
grants
sight,
you
can
cast
it
in
a
bush
to
safely
check
them.
Crystallize
will
grant
assists
if
an
enemy
champion
touches
it
before
dying.
Be
careful
of
turrets
targeting
you
if
an
enemy
touches
your
wall.
Crystallize
can
also
be
used
to
stop
Maokai's
Sapling
Toss
and
Elise's
Volatile
Spiderling
from
running
by
placing
it
on
top
of
the
sapling,
which
prevents
it
from
running
anywhere,
or
pushing
a
minion
into
it,
causing
it
to
re-assign
its
target.
Crystallize
deals
1
true
damage
-
that's
why
you
get
an
assist
by
placing
a
wall
on
the
enemy.
It
is
also
possible
to
disrupt
channeled
ultimates'
animations
by
putting
Crystallize
directly
on
top
of
the
opponent.
If
done
correctly
will
shift
the
opponent
from
his/her
position,
canceling
the
animation,
but
not
the
ability.
This
is
useful
if
Flash
Frost
is
on
cooldown.
Be
aware
though
that
only
the
animation
is
stopped,
so
the
abilities
effects
are
still
in
effect
until
they
are
hit
by
a
hard
crowd
control
effect
or
take
action.
Frostbite
deals
double
if
the
target
is
chilled
by
either
Flash
Frost
or
Glacial
Storm
,
so
try
to
time
it
correctly.
Casting
Frostbite
on
an
opponent
and
immediately
placing
Glacial
Storm
on
top
of
them
will
chill
the
target,
allowing
for
a
much
quicker
Frostbite
combo.
Glacial
Storm
is
a
great
spell
that
can
clear
entire
minion
waves
very
quickly.
Be
sure
to
deactivate
the
spell
when
you
don't
need
it
as
it
will
quickly
drain
your
mana
.
Glacial
Storm
is
an
ideal
tower
taking
ability,
assuming
you
have
blue
buff
/
high
mana
regen.
You
can
drop
your
glacial
storm
on
the
wide
gap
of
the
turret
where
the
minions
come
out.
This
gives
a
lot
of
enemy
champions
problems
especially
if
they
are
melee
due
to
them
having
to
make
the
choice
of
walking
through
the
storm
and
getting
hit
with
a
Flash
Frost
to
Frostbite
combo
or
try
to
make
their
way
around
the
small
areas
left
not
covered
by
the
glacial
storm
setting
up
for
an
easy
FF/FB
combo.
The
same
concept
can
be
used
from
enemies
playing
offensively
and
attacking
your
tower.
Build
usage
Anivia
has
severe
mana
problems.
Without
Crest
of
the
Ancient
Golem
,
she
can
quickly
run
out
of
mana
from
many
of
her
abilities,
especially
Glacial
Storm
.
Chalice
of
Harmony
,
and
eventually
Athene's
Unholy
Grail
,
as
your
first
item
is
a
very
useful
purchase
as
it
can
sustain
your
mana
,
increase
your
damage
output,
and,
along
with
the
Crest
of
the
Ancient
Golem
buff
can
lead
to
effortless
AoE
farming
and
pushing.
Due
to
the
mechanic
of
Flash
Frost
and
Glacial
Storm
(you
have
to
use
both
twice
in
order
to
activate
and
deactivate)
Anivia
can
gain
bonus
mana
from
Tear
of
the
Goddess
twice
per
spell.
Use
them
at
the
fountain
while
shopping
to
gain
a
few
extra
charges.
A
Catalyst
the
Protector
is
a
great
item
to
help
Anivia
in
her
laning
phase,
giving
her
some
much
needed
health
and
mana
and
can
be
built
into
a
Rod
of
Ages
later
in
the
game.
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
provides
more
powerful
slows
on
Anivia's
enemies.
Starting
from
20%
slow
without
Rylai's
.
Following
with
24.2%
slow
via
Flash
Frost
or
Glacial
Storm
.
And
totaling
with
39.55%
slow
via
Glacial
Storm
+
Frostbite
combo.
Bear
in
mind
that
slows
from
Anivia's
spells
do
not
stack
with
each
other.
Because
Anivia's
damage
comes
from
only
three
abilities
and
two
of
them
have
a
100%
AP
ratio
on
a
"chilled"
target,
Rabadon's
Deathcap
is
very
beneficial
in
increasing
her
magic
damage
.
Liandry's
Torment
in
conjunction
with
Glacial
Storm
can
yield
to
devastating
results.
Since
Anivia
can
be
very
mana
hungry,
consider
starting
out
with
2
Faerie
Charm
s
and
3
potions.

Countering
Try
to
destroy
her
egg
from
her
Rebirth
to
prevent
her
from
coming
back
to
life.
At
early
game,
the
egg
is
fairly
weak,
as
it
reduces
her
armor
and
magic
resistance
instead
of
increasing.
Use
this
to
your
advantage.
Use
knockback
or
pull
effects
to
place
the
egg
away
from
allies
or
turrets
that
can
aid
its
survival.
Anivia
is
very
squishy
both
early
game
and
late
game.
It
is
recommended
to
solo
her
while
she
is
weak
early
game.
Try
to
engage
her
when
her
Rebirth
is
on
cooldown.
Flash
Frost
will
stun
you
if
you
are
in
the
path
of
the
spell.
Try
to
move
away
from
the
path
to
avoid
both
the
stun
and
damage.
Keep
ranged
from
her
to
avoid
damage.
When
escaping
from
her,
move
criss
cross
to
avoid
her
Flash
Frost
from
a
distance.
Avoid
confrontation
with
her
in
the
jungle.
Her
Crystallize
can
block
you
from
escaping
or
chasing
easily.
Keep
in
mind
that
the
double
damage
effect
in
her
Frostbite
only
applies
when
you
are
hit
by
her
Flash
Frost
or
Glacial
Storm
.
It
will
not
proc
if
you
are
slowed
by
abilities
or
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
.
Crowd
control
effects
that
stop
abilities
from
being
cast,
such
as
stuns
or
silences,
immediately
stop
Glacial
Storm
from
being
channeled.
If
Anivia
is
not
guaranteed
to
die
within
the
duration
of
such
crowd
control
effects,
it
may
be
wiser
to
save
them
in
expectation
of
Glacial
Storm
to
stop
it
from
being
channeled.
