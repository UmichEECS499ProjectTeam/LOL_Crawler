Mid
lane
Vel’Koz
is
a
creature
of
raw
power,
not
speed,
and
as
such
carries
out
his
finest
research
on
the
mid
lane
of
Summoner’s
Rift.
The
towers
here
are
placed
closer
together,
giving
the
Eye
of
the
Void
less
distance
to
travel
when
enemy
junglers
dare
to
get
between
him
and
his
research
subjects.
A
short
autoattack
range
means
Vel’Koz
is
often
in
the
thick
of
the
fighting,
but
he
has
the
necessary
tools
in
his
abilities
to
dissuade
his
lane
opponent
from
engaging.
Enemy
midlaners
within
their
own
minion
waves
are
vulnerable
to
poke
through
Void
Rift,
while
opponents
caught
in
the
open
make
easy
targets
for
Plasma
Fission.
Using
abilities
frequently
benefits
Vel’Koz:
fully
stacking
Organic
Deconstruction
against
his
opposing
laner
deals
substantial
true
damage,
forcing
his
counterpart
to
choose
between
moving
in
to
secure
minion
gold
or
retreating
until
their
Deconstruction
stacks
have
dissipated.
Aggressive
enemies
risk
a
quick
death
once
Vel’Koz
catches
them
with
further
rounds
of
Void
Rift
followed
by
Tectonic
Disruption,
while
those
that
flee
are
still
subject
to
considerable
ranged
harass.
With
clever
aiming
and
timing
of
Plasma
Fission’s
second
cast,
Vel’Koz
can
both
steer
his
ability
around
enemy
minions
and
gain
additional
range
through
geometric
finesse.
Vel’Koz
becomes
an
entirely
different
beast
once
he
gains
access
to
Life
Form
Disintegration
Ray.
His
ult
deals
devastating
amounts
of
damage
to
all
enemies
caught,
but
its
long
channel
time
and
slow
turn
speed
makes
initial
positioning
absolutely
paramount.
Because
of
this,
Vel’Koz
does
best
bringing
his
ult
to
bear
following
a
few
successful
rounds
of
poking,
after
his
opponents
are
sufficiently
researched
with
Organic
Deconstruction
and
wounded
enough
to
keep
their
distance.
Even
the
minion
cover
often
granted
by
distance
is
ignored
by
Life
Form
Disintegration
Ray’s
absolute
power,
which
fully
affects
all
enemies
within
its
substantial
range.
Teamfights
As
teams
start
skirmishing
around
Summoner’s
Rift,
Vel’Koz
is
safest
positioning
himself
within
or
behind
his
allies,
harassing
his
enemies
with
repeated
casts
of
Plasma
Fission
and
Tectonic
Disruption.
When
caught
in
unfavorable
positions,
Vel’Koz
fires
off
Plasma
Fission
while
retreating
to
kite
his
pursuers
and
positions
Void
Rift
in
choke
points
to
dissuade
enemies
from
following
further.
In
favorable
situations,
Vel’Koz
uses
the
same
ability
to
separate
his
subject
from
its
pack
before
unleashing
Tectonic
Disruption
and
Plasma
Fission
to
quickly
catch
and
dispatch
them.
In
full-scale
teamfights,
Vel’Koz
again
works
best
from
the
back
line,
tossing
out
damage
and
crowd
control
with
Plasma
Fission
as
he
builds
Deconstruction
stacks
on
his
enemies.
Allied
protection
is
key
here
as
enemy
bruisers,
once
they
get
to
Vel’Koz,
make
short
work
of
the
tentacled
glass
cannon.
Still,
Vel’Koz
has
a
few
tricks
of
his
own
to
ensure
his
safety:
Plasma
Fission
makes
for
an
excellent
kiting
tool,
while
the
combined
knock
back
and
knock
up
from
Tectonic
Disruption
allows
Vel’Koz
to
reposition
away
from
danger.
Finally,
once
enough
enemies
are
primed
from
his
harass,
once
his
team
has
set
up
a
safe
area
for
Vel’Koz
to
channel
in,
the
Eye
of
the
Void
unleashes
Life
Form
Disintegration
Ray
to
melt
through
the
massed
enemy
ranks
and
leave
his
foes
staggering
under
sheer,
overwhelming
damage.
Skills
Usage
Vel'Koz's
Q
has
a
high
base
damage,
low
mana
cost
and
short
cooldown,
making
it
his
main
poke/harass
tool.
W
is
his
best
farming
tool
and
applies
2
out
of
3
stacks
of
his
passive.
His
E
is
his
CC
and
can
be
used
to
disengage
(as
he
has
no
real
form
of
escape)
or
to
disrupt
channeled
enemy
abilities.
Note
that
your
passive
can
be
maintained
with
auto-attacks.
This
is
especially
useful
for
early
harass
as
you
can't
cast
spells
fast
enough
to
maintain
it
otherwise.
Like
all
channels,
your
ultimate
can
be
interrupted
by
CC.
Make
sure
that
most
of
your
enemies
crowd
control
is
wasted
before
using
your
ultimate
to
ensure
maximum
damage.
Although
it
will
take
some
practice
you
can
catch
people
off
with
your
Q
angle.
This
is
essential
for
a
good
Vel'Koz
player.
Do
not
underestimate
the
power
of
your
passive.
You
can
burst
down
tanks
quite
easily
due
to
the
true
damage.
So
it
is
highly
recommended
to
use
your
abilities
in
quick
succession.
One
such
combo
would
be
E->W->Q.
Vel'Koz's
abilities
have
a
low
mana
cost
and
short
cooldown,
so
keep
that
in
mind.
This
is
quite
obvious,
but
do
not
forget
that
your
ultimate
can
pass
through
people
and
deals
full
damage
to
all
targets,
while
also
applying
multiple
stacks
of
your
passive
in
quick
succession.
However,
aim
it
carefully
because
it
only
lasts
about
2.5
seconds
and
the
laser
adjusts
to
the
position
of
your
cursor
at
a
slow
pace.
Also,
beware
of
champion
abilities
that
can
disrupt
it.
Build
Usage
Vel'Koz's
high
base
damage,
CC,
and
additional
passive
true
damage
makes
CDR
one
of
the
most
valuable
stats.
Vel'Koz
AP
ratios
are
somewhat
low,
making
AP
less
useful
than
on
other
mages,
but
still
desirable.
Vel'Koz's
high
base
damage
gives
him
good
mileage
out
of
Magic
Pen.
Since
many
of
his
abilities
have
some
form
of
CC
(heavy
slows,
knock-ups),
Liandry's
Torment
is
also
a
good
build
option.
Because
spamming
your
skills
is
required
to
activate
your
passive,
Vel'Koz
can
become
very
mana
hungry
early
on.
Buying
a
Chalice
of
Harmony
or
a
Catalyst
the
Protector
is
recommended.
Having
low
mobility
and
one
form
of
hard
CC,
Vel'Koz
is
vulnerable
to
assassins'
burst
damage.
Zhonya's
Hourglass's
active
is
very
helpful
in
letting
you
survive
a
burst.

Recommended
Team
Compositions
Playing
as
Vel'Koz
requires
you
to
be
on
your
toes
because
you
are
incredibly
squishy.
Someone
on
your
team
with
disruption
like
Vi
or
Malphite
will
help
you
stay
alive
due
to
the
fact
you
are
in
the
back
lines.
Someone
with
lock
down
like
Thresh
or
Cho'Gath
will
allow
you
to
channel
you
ultimate
without
getting
interrupted.
Countering
Vel'Koz
is
a
high
damage
quick
burst
champion
due
to
the
fact
that
he
can
hold
up
to
2
stacks
on
his
W
and
his
ult
can
inflict
5
stacks
of
his
passive
in
one
full
channel.
Having
an
ability
such
as
a
silence
or
knock
up
will
shut
down
his
combo
enough
for
you
to
counter
attack
or
run
away.
Someone
with
high
mobility
like
Kassadin
or
a
skill
shot
block
like
Yasuo
can
effectively
counter
or
shut
him
down.
Vel'Koz's
range
is
his
best
defense,
all
his
skills
are
skill
shots,
and
he
has
no
reliant
escape.
Thus,
high
mobility
champions
such
as
Fizz
or
Ezreal
can
counter
him.
His
true
damage
passive
makes
magic
resist
less
useful
for
countering
him.
It
may
be
better
to
purchase
movement
speed
enhancing
items
in
order
to
avoid
more
of
his
attacks,
and
health
to
reduce
the
percentage
of
health
that
his
true
damage
deals.
Lifeform
Disintegration
Ray
is
very
powerful,
but
he
turns
slowly.
It
can
be
best
avoided
by
walking
around
him.
Remember
that
the
closer
you
are
to
him,
the
easier
this
become.
Remember
that
Vel'Koz
can
keep
up
his
passive
stacks
with
his
auto
attacks.
When
you
have
two
stacks
make
sure
you
back
off
so
he
can't
update
the
stacks.
