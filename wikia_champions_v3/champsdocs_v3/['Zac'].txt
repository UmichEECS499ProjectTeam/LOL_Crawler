Zac,
the
Secret
Weapon
is
a
champion
in
League
of
Legends
.
[1]
[2]
Abilities
Cell
Division
Static
Cooldown:
300
Each
time
Zac
uses
an
ability
on
enemies,
he
sheds
a
chunk
of
himself
to
a
nearby
location.
Zac
can
move
over
these
chunks
to
reabsorb
them,
regaining
4%
of
his
maximum
health
.
Enemies
may
move
over
these
chunks
to
destroy
them.
Upon
taking
fatal
damage,
Zac
splits
into
4
bloblets
that
attempt
to
recombine.
Each
bloblet
has
12%
of
Zac's
maximum
health
,
and
50%
of
his
armor
and
magic
resistance.
If
any
of
these
bloblets
remain
after
8
seconds,
Zac
will
revive
with
10-50%
health
depending
on
the
health
of
the
surviving
chunks.
Ability
Details
Cell
Division
grants
two
passive
effects:
one
that
triggers
whenever
Zac
lands
one
of
his
abilities;
and
one
that
triggers
when
Zac
takes
fatal
damage.
Additional
Information:
Cell
Division
has
two
spawn
behaviors
for
chunks
-
"contestable"
and
"non-contestable".
Non-contestable
is
used
by
default,
with
contestable
being
used
if
there
is
a
visible
enemy
champion
within
1000
units
of
Zac.
Non-contestable:
Chunks
will
fall
to
the
ground
near
to
Zac
and
can
be
picked
up
immediately.
Contestable:
Chunks
will
fall
to
the
ground
between
Zac
and
the
nearest
enemy
champion,
slightly
in
favour
of
Zac.
Chunks
cannot
be
interacted
with
for
the
first
0.25
seconds,
except
during
Let's
Bounce!
.
The
pick-up
radius
is
the
same
for
both
Zac
and
enemy
champions
(50).
Zac's
abilities
cost
4%
of
his
current
health
while
chunks
heal
4%
of
his
maximum,
a
net
heal
of
4%
of
his
missing
health.
Zac
gets
larger
when
his
current
health
exceeds
the
base
health
for
his
level.
Chrono
Shift
and
Guardian
Angel
will
take
precedence
over
Cell
Division.
Bloblet
Bloblets
are
not
controllable
and
are
functionally
minions.
Bloblets
can
be
Smited
or
Consumed
.
Allies
can
Teleport
to
bloblets.
Turrets
will
prioritize
bloblets
over
other
minions.
Bloblets
ignore
knockback
effects
and
take
33%
reduced
AoE
damage.
