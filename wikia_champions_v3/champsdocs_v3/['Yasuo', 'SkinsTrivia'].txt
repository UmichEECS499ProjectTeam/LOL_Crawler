Trivia
Yasuo
was
designed
by
CertainlyT
.
Yasuo
is
voiced
by
Liam
O'Brien
.
[1]
Yasuo
means
"honest
or
peaceful
one"
in
Japanese.
Yasuo
is
not
his
birth
name.
He
was
given
this
new
name
when
he
joined
the
sword
school
in
an
effort
to
steady
his
wild
nature.
Yasuo's
appearance
is
most
likely
a
reference
to
Musashi
Miyamoto,
a
historical
Japanese
swordsman
and
wandering
samurai.
The
facial
appearance
and
ponytail
in
particular
are
very
similar
to
popular
artistic
portrayals
of
Miyamoto,
and
his
combat
style
is
similar
to
Miyamoto's
prior
to
his
creation
of
his
famous
twin-sword
style.
Yasuo's
techniques
and
animations
bear
resemblance
to
Haoumaru
,
a
sake-loving
warrior
from
the
game
series
Samurai
Spirits/Samurai
Shodown,
who
in
turn
is
also
based
on
Musashi
Miyamoto.
This
is
further
supported
by
Yasuo's
taunt
and
joke
animations;
one
of
them
involve
spitting
his
drink
on
his
blade,
which
Haoumaru
also
does
to
"bless
it"
before
battle.
Yasuo
also
bears
a
resemblance
to
Mitsurugi
from
the
Soul
Calibur
series.
Yasuo
speaks
a
dialect
of
ancient
Ionian.
It’s
related
to
the
dialect
that
Karma
speaks,
but
is
not
the
same
dialect.
Quotes
Yasuo's
quote
"Ninjas...
I
hate
those
guys."
is
similar
to
Ezreal's
quote
"Noxians...
I
hate
those
guys"
.
Yasuo's
special
taunt
when
near
Master
Yi
"Wuju?
No,
I
wouldn't."
is
a
reference
to
the
latter's
joke
"
Wuju...
pass
me
that
potion?
"
.
In
addition,
the
"Nice...
sword...
boots?"
line
is
more
than
likely
a
reference
to
the
popular
pro
as
heck
guide
to
Master
Yi
video.
Yasuo's
quote
"No
one
is
promised
tomorrow!"
might
be
a
reference
to
Clint
Eastwood's
"Tomorrow
is
promised
to
no
one!"
.
His
quote
"A
wanderer
isn't
always
lost"
could
be
a
reference
to
J.
R.
R.
Tolkien's
"Not
all
who
wander
are
lost"
line
from
the
poem
"All
that
is
gold
does
not
glitter".
Skins
High
Noon
Yasuo
skin
is
inspired
by
"The
classic
spaghetti
Westerns
directed
by
Sergio
Leone".
These
films
were,
in
turn,
inspired
by
the
very
same
classic
Japanese
samurai
films
upon
which
Yasuo's
core
concept
is
based.
Yasuo
shares
his
High
Noon
skin
with
Twisted
Fate
.
High
Noon
Yasuo
wields
a
gunblade,
albeit
one
that
retains
the
blade
of
his
katana.
Relations
Yasuo
is
searching
for
the
true
murderer
of
the
Elder
he
is
believed
to
have
killed
--
someone
who
has
mastered
the
wind
technique
as
he
has.
Riot's
champion
page
for
Riven
shows
a
link
for
Yasuo
added
to
her
rivals
section.
Yasuo
also
has
a
special
quote
against
her:
"Which
weighs
more,
Riven?
Your
blade,
or
your
past?"
indicating
that
she
may
have
been
the
killer.
This
is
also
referenced
in
his
quote
"Wait,
that
technique...
huh.",
indicating
that
she
is
also
trained
to
use
the
wind
as
a
weapon.
This
is
reflected
in
the
name
of
her
second
ultimate,
Wind
Slash.
Yasuo
has
been
branded
a
traitor
and
is
hunted
by
the
other
warriors
of
Ionia.
No
specific
champions
have
been
named,
however.
