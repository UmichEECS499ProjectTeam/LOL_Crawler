Lore
Teemo
is
a
legend
among
his
yordle
brothers
and
sisters
in
Bandle
City
.
As
far
as
yordles
are
concerned,
there
is
something
just
slightly
off
about
him.
While
Teemo
enjoys
the
companionship
of
other
yordles,
he
also
insists
on
frequent
solo
missions
in
the
ongoing
defense
of
Bandle
City.
Despite
his
genuinely
warm
personality,
something
switches
off
inside
Teemo's
mind
during
combat
so
that
the
lives
he
must
end
while
on
patrol
do
not
burden
him.
Even
as
a
young
recruit,
the
drill
instructors
and
other
trainees
found
it
a
little
disconcerting
that,
while
Teemo
was
normally
charming
and
kind,
he
turned
deadly
serious
and
highly
efficient
the
minute
combat
exercises
began.
Teemo's
superiors
quickly
steered
him
toward
the
Scouts
of
the
Mothership,
which
is
one
of
Bandle
City's
most
distinguished
Special
Forces
unit
alongside
the
Megling
Commandos.
While
most
yordles
do
not
handle
solo
scouting
missions
with
a
great
deal
of
finesse,
Teemo
is
remarkably
efficient
at
them.
His
record
of
success
in
defending
Bandle
City
from
infiltrators
easily
makes
him
one
of
the
most
dangerous
yordles
alive,
though
you'd
never
know
it
by
having
a
cup
of
honey
mead
with
him
at
his
favorite
inn.
Bandle
City
chose
Teemo
as
their
first
champion
for
the
League
,
and
he
has
taken
to
it
like
a
duck
to
water.
His
signature
weapon
-
a
blowgun
-
uses
a
rare
ajunta
poison
he
personally
gathers
from
the
jungles
of
Kumungu
.
To
help
cope
with
his
lengthy
periods
of
isolation,
Teemo
recently
struck
up
a
friendship
with
Tristana
,
a
fellow
League
champion
and
fellow
member
of
Bandle
City's
Special
Forces.
This
connection
is
healthy
for
both
yordles,
though
now
Valoran's
voracious
media
outlets
circulate
rumors
that
the
friendship
is
turning
into
a
romantic
relationship.
Regardless,
Teemo
is
a
crowd
favorite
in
the
League
of
Legends
,
and
a
pint-sized
foe
that
many
have
come
to
fear.
"Teemo
rides
a
thin
line
between
chipper
compatriot
and
unrepentant
killer,
but
there's
no
one
else
I'd
rather
have
as
a
friend."
―
Tristana
As
far
as
yordles
are
concerned,
there
is
something
slightly
wrong
with
Teemo.
While
he
enjoys
-
and
in
fact
needs
-
the
level
of
community
and
companionship
inherent
to
all
yordles,
Teemo
feels
it
so
strongly
that
he
ventures
out
on
his
own
to
destroy
the
enemies
of
Bandle
City
.
There
is
something
that
switches
off
in
Teemo,
so
that
the
lives
he
ends
do
not
burden
him.
It
seemed
only
logical
to
send
him
to
fight
in
the
League
of
Legends
as
the
champion
of
Bandle
City.
He
has
taken
to
the
League
like
a
duck
to
water,
seeking
out
the
foes
of
the
yordles
and
extinguishing
them
with
the
rare
ajunta
poison
he
personally
gathers
from
the
jungles
of
Kumungu.
However,
the
limited
company
of
his
own
kind
wears
on
Teemo,
and
cracks
are
beginning
to
show
in
his
innocent
and
chipper
facade.
"Though
he
is
known
as
the
Swift
Scout,
it
is
clear
that
Teemo
is
actually
something
else
-
the
unrepentant
assassin
of
Bandle
City."
Captain
of
the
Bandle
City
Scouts,
Teemo
is
the
foremost
defender
of
the
yordle
homeland.
In
addition
to
his
duties
as
scout
leader—which
include
planning
the
soap-box
derby,
teaching
new
recruits
the
scout’s
pledge,
and
judging
the
yearly
s’more-eating
contest—Teemo
is
also
responsible
for
the
defense
of
Bandle
City
itself.
In
Teemo’s
bestselling
autobiography,
Accuracy
by
Volume,
the
leader
of
the
Bandle
City
Scouts
expounds
on
yordle
military
tactics,
such
as
blow-dart
carpet
bombing,
and
filling
trebuchets
with
poison-tipped
sewing
needles.
Though
he
can
often
be
found
in
the
courtyard
outside
the
practice
arenas
signing
copies
of
his
book,
Teemo
is
really
at
the
League
of
Legends
for
another
reason.
He
has
come,
as
the
emissary
for
the
entire
yordle
nation,
to
petition
the
Institute
of
War
to
start
a
new
type
of
tournament.
His
proposition
includes
wood
carving,
rope
bridge
building,
and
campfire
cooking
to
the
list
of
approved
forms
of
“combat”
sanctioned
inside
the
League.
So
far,
he
hasn’t
had
much
luck.
