Trivia
Rumble
was
designed
by
FeralPony
.
[1]
Rumble
and
Corki
are
the
only
yordles
that
ride
something.
Rumble's
mech
is
named
"Tristy".
Rumble
is
voiced
by
Richard
Steven
Horvitz
,
who
also
voices
Ziggs
.
Rumble
is,
along
with
Caitlyn
,
Lissandra
,
Varus
,
Vi
,
Xerath
,and
Ziggs
,
one
of
the
few
champions
that
can
CC
themselves.
Rumble's
name
and
attitude
resemble
that
of
Rumble
,
a
trash-talking
villain
from
the
Transformers
.
Rumble
was
the
first
manaless
champion
to
have
a
difficulty
rating
of
100.
Rumble's
quote
"This
is
gonna
be
bumpy"
may
be
a
reference
to
a
similar
quote
by
Jordan
C.
Wilde
in
the
anime
"Ōban
Star-Racers".
Rumble's
special
ability
The
Equalizer
may
be
a
referance
to
the
TF2
"Soldier"
character.
There
is
also
a
weapon
for
the
Solider
named
The
Equalizer
.
Rumble's
special
ability
fires
rockets,
and
the
TF2
soldier's
primary
weapon
is
a
rocket
launcher.
Skins
Rumble
in
the
Jungle
is
a
play
on
words,
also
used
for
the
name
of
the
boxing
match
Rumble
in
the
jungle
.
The
Chinese
Bilgerat
Rumble
artwork
shows
Rumble
shooting
bullets
instead
of
flames.
Similarly,
Rumble
in
the
Jungle's
flamethrower
is
shooting
some
type
of
grenade.
Super
Galaxy
Rumble
appears
to
be
based
on
fan
suggestion
,
which
in
turn
appears
to
have
been
based
on
Gurren
Lagann
.
Relations
While
Rumble
dislikes
Piltover
,
he
is
loyal
to
Bandle
City
.
It
is
hinted
from
The
Journal
of
Justice
that
Rumble
has
a
crush
on
Tristana
and
therefore
named
his
mech
Tristy.
He
believed
that
Heimerdinger
and
his
associates
were
"sellouts",
trading
superior
yordle
technology
to
humans
for
nothing
more
than
a
pat
on
the
head
while
yordles
remained
the
butt
of
their
jokes.
