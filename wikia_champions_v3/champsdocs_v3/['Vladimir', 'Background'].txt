Lore
There
is
a
temple
hidden
in
the
mountains
between
Noxus
and
the
Tempest
Flats,
where
the
secrets
of
an
ancient
and
terrifying
sorcery
are
kept.
The
area
surrounding
the
temple
is
littered
with
the
exsanguinated
corpses
of
those
who
have
mistakenly
wandered
too
close.
These
served
only
to
pique
the
curiosity
of
Vladimir,
when
–
in
his
youth
–
he
trekked
through
these
mountains
during
his
flight
from
Noxus.
A
day
earlier,
the
teenaged
Vladimir
had
brutally
murdered
two
boys
of
his
age,
for
no
better
reason
than
to
enjoy
the
intoxicating
scarlet
bloom
that
surged
forth.
He
realized
immediately
that
he
would
never
be
able
to
suppress
his
murderous
desires,
and
if
he
remained
in
Noxus,
his
foul
deeds
were
sure
to
catch
up
with
him.
Without
hesitation,
he
abandoned
the
city-state,
and
journeyed
south.
The
trail
of
bodies
led
him
to
a
crumbling
stone
temple.
Inside
he
found
an
aging
monk
who
appraised
him
with
eyes
of
pure
crimson.
Vladimir
surprised
the
monk
by
returning
the
wicked
gaze
with
zeal.
Recognizing
the
boy’s
sinister
craving,
the
monk
taught
Vladimir
how
to
manipulate
and
control
the
fluid
of
life,
often
practicing
on
passing
travelers.
When
it
came
time
for
Vladimir
to
learn
the
final
lesson,
the
monk
warned
that
failure
would
result
in
death.
Vladimir
did
not
fail,
but
success
bore
a
grisly
surprise.
During
the
ritual,
every
drop
of
the
monk's
blood
was
drawn
from
his
body
and
fused
with
Vladimir's,
imbuing
him
with
his
master's
magical
essence,
and
that
of
every
hemomancer
before
him.
Left
alone
and
suddenly
without
purpose,
Vladimir
resolved
to
return
to
Noxus,
demanding
enrollment
in
the
League
to
prove
the
supremacy
of
his
craft.
When
the
Noxian
High
Command
observed
the
gruesome
fates
which
befell
the
palace
guards,
they
elected
to
avail
themselves
of
Vladimir's
unsavory
talents.
"That
which
runs
through
you
will
run
you
through."

CLE
OBSERVATION
Vladimir
moves
with
purpose,
his
long
hair
and
robes
flowing
dramatically
behind
him
as
his
deliberate
strides
carry
him
swiftly
towards
his
goal.
The
heels
of
his
polished
boots
ring
out
against
the
marble
halls
of
the
Institute
of
War,
an
unwelcome
clamor
in
the
otherwise
oppressive
silence.
He
spies
his
destination
ahead,
a
great
stone
doorway.
The
regal
demeanor
of
our
guest
is
a
hoax;
a
trap
for
those
foolish
enough
not
to
look
beyond
the
surface.
The
perfectly
groomed
hair,
the
extravagant
attire,
the
manicured
fingernails…
these
marks
of
nobility
are
false.
The
truly
perceptive
will
not
be
deceived
by
this
charade.
From
his
cruel,
angular
features,
to
the
vicious,
yet
regal,
jewelry
that
adorns
his
fingertips,
there
is
no
doubt:
this
is
a
predator.
Vladimir
pauses
for
a
moment
as
he
arrives,
relishing
the
moment.
He
admires
the
craftsmanship
with
fickle,
covetous
eyes.
A
pair
of
panthers
stand
sentry
in
the
relief
of
the
marble
archway,
their
lithe
forms
a
tribute
to
their
artisan's
talent.
An
inscription
above
announces
his
destination:
"The
truest
opponent
lies
within."
He
reaches
out
to
caress
the
polished
stone.
The
doors
part
at
his
touch,
drifting
silently
open.
Beyond
them
lay
blackness.
Vladimir
licks
his
thin
lips,
and
darts
inside.
REFLECTION
Vladimir
stood
in
the
darkness
of
the
Reflecting
Chamber.
For
a
moment
there
was
only
the
silence
and
the
expectant
beating
of
his
heart.
Then
there
was
a
whisper.
"Vladimir,
my
child,"
called
a
voice
from
the
black.
He
recognized
it
instantly,
and
his
hair
stood
on
end.
Out
of
the
darkness
strode
another
figure,
of
similar
stature
but
clothed
in
the
simpler
robes
of
a
monk.
His
ashen
hair
was
rivaled
only
by
the
sickly
pallor
of
his
skin.
His
eyes
were
pure
crimson.
"Dmitri?"
Vladimir
inquired,
incredulous,
"but,
master,
you
are
gone.
I
killed
you."
The
figure
threw
back
his
head,
howling
with
laughter.
"I
cannot
be
gone,
Vladimir.
I
am
a
part
of
you."
As
if
in
response,
the
monk's
body
dissolved
into
a
fine
red
mist.
The
metallic
smell
of
blood
filled
the
air.
Vladimir
closed
his
eyes
and
breathed
deeply,
the
warm
vapor
bathing
him
in
its
welcome
embrace.
The
sound
of
sharp,
labored
breaths
woke
him
from
his
reverie.
His
eyes
snapped
open,
revealing
a
clearing
in
a
serene
forest.
His
heart
raced
in
an
excited
rhythm.
At
his
feet
lay
two
mangled
forms
-
one
still,
the
other
gasping
-
both
drenched
in
blood.
Vladimir
examined
himself
in
wonder.
He
was
a
boy
no
older
than
fifteen.
In
his
right
hand
he
clutched
a
hunting
knife
in
a
death
grip
-
so
hard,
in
fact,
that
the
handle
had
cut
him.
His
fine
clothes
were
sullied
everywhere
with
scarlet.
He
knew
this
moment.
These
were
his
playmates.
These
were
his
first.
The
maimed
figure
crawled
towards
him,
looking
up
with
a
mixture
of
sadness
and
bewilderment.
The
expression
turned
to
hatred.
A
hand
shot
forward,
gripping
his
boot.
Vladimir
recoiled,
breaking
free
and
stumbling
backwards
away
from
the
dying
child.
The
boy
opened
his
mouth
as
if
to
scream,
but
no
words
came
out.
Instead,
a
torrent
of
blood
spilled
forth
from
his
lips
into
the
dirt.
He
extended
an
accusing
finger
at
his
murderer.
Vladimir
dropped
his
knife,
and
the
darkness
took
him.
A
moment
later
he
was
standing
at
the
foot
of
a
mountain
trail
in
the
shadow
of
a
great
structure.
Before
him,
propped
on
a
spike,
lay
a
blanched
corpse.
Beneath
that
lay
a
font
of
blood,
hewn
into
the
rocks
by
primitive
tools.
He
looked
up,
raising
a
hand
to
shield
his
wind-burned
face.
The
trail
before
him
contained
perhaps
a
dozen
such
specimens,
set
at
even
intervals
along
the
path.
He
felt
the
now
familiar
quickening
of
his
pulse.
The
thrill
overwhelming
any
sense
of
dread,
he
ascended.
Wandering
through
the
halls
of
this
ancient
structure,
the
trail
of
drained
bodies
guiding
his
path,
Vladimir's
excitement
grew.
He
came
at
last
to
a
great
hall.
All
about
him
hung
the
deceased,
their
lifeblood
settling
in
pools
below.
At
the
front
of
the
grisly
scene
stood
a
robed
monk,
white
hair
slicked
back
out
of
his
face.
His
blood-red
eyes
shone
menacingly
on
his
pale,
implacable
face
as
he
beckoned
to
the
enraptured
traveler.
Vladimir
approached,
unblinking;
entranced
by
the
spectacle,
eyes
locked
on
the
man
before
him.
The
monk
stared
back
curiously.
"Have
you
no
fear,
boy?"
he
asked,
interested.
Vladimir
shook
his
head
wordlessly,
never
breaking
his
gaze.
"I
see
what
you
are,"
the
monk
continued,
"You
are
a
harbinger,
my
child.
A
Crimson
Reaper,
come
to
collect."
He
smiled
grimly,
a
peal
of
laughter
following.
"What
is
your
name,
young
one?"
"I
am
called
Vladimir,"
stammered
the
bewildered
youth.
"You
are
now
my
charge,
Vladimir,"
replied
the
aging
figure,
smiling.
"Do
not
disappoint
me."
Vladimir
stared
deeply
into
his
mentor's
eyes.
The
sight
made
his
veins
run
ice.
He
had
killed
this
man.
He
had
taken
his
blood.
And
Dmitri
had
asked
him
to
do
it;
had
threatened
him
with
death
if
he
refused.
The
room
around
him
went
dark
once
more,
leaving
him
alone
again
with
the
phantom
of
his
master.
The
monk
folded
his
arms
across
his
chest.
"Why
do
you
want
to
join
the
League,
Vladimir?"
asked
Dmitri
expectantly.
"I
wish
to
bring
honor
to
my
noble
house
and
to
hone
my
craft,"
Vladimir
answered
immediately.
The
apparition
before
cracked
a
bemused
smile.
"Why
do
you
want
to
join
the
League,
Vladimir?"
it
repeated.
"To
fight
for
the
glory
of
Noxus,
my
homeland,"
Vladimir
replied,
hesitant.
Dimitri's
amusement
vanished.
He
looked
displeased.
"Why
do
you
want
to
join
the
League,
Vladimir?"
he
echoed.
Vladimir's
face
darkened.
He
answered,
slowly
this
time,
"I
must
kill."
The
old
monk
nodded.
"How
does
it
feel,
exposing
your
mind?"
he
asked.
Vladimir
bared
his
teeth.
"Liberating,
really,"
came
his
retort.
As
if
in
response,
the
door
behind
flew
open,
bathing
him
in
light.
He
was
alone.

If
you’re
like
me
and
you’ve
ever
gone
through
one
of
those
dark,
goth
phases
at
some
point
in
your
life,
you’ll
probably
relate
to
this
next
champion
at
least
a
little
bit.
Meet
Vladimir,
the
Crimson
Reaper.
This
champion
combines
the
epic
power
of
fueling
his
magic
with
the
blood
of
his
enemies
with
the
style
and
flair
of
Transylvanian
count.
You
know
the
type
of
count
we’re
talking
about…
the
type
that
has
a
lifetime
supply
of
liquid
black
eyeliner
sitting
in
his
medicine
cabinet.
So
dust
off
that
copy
of
Bram
Stoker’s
Dracula
that
you’ve
got
sitting
on
your
nightstand.
If
you
start
reading
now,
you
should
be
super
excited
by
the
prospect
of
getting
your
hands
on
Vladimir
by
the
time
you
finish.
