Skill
usage
Intent
doubles
your
total
Critical
Strike
chance,
giving
Yasuo
an
advantage
during
the
late
game.
Resolve
shields
Yasuo
from
incoming
attacks
for
a
short
time,
but
only
when
his
Flow
bar
is
filled.
Use
this
to
your
advantage
when
trading
during
the
early
game
as
most
(if
not
all)
of
the
damage
you
take
will
be
nullified.
Since
Steel
Tempest
has
no
cost
and
has
very
short
cooldown,
it
s
a
great
tool
for
harassing
and
last
hitting
in
lane.
Sweeping
Blade
is
best
used
when
there
are
nearby
minions,
for
the
following
reasons:
It
deals
more
damage
for
each
successive
target.
It
allows
for
quick
juking,
closing
or
escaping.
It
can
quickly
charge
Resolve
.
Sweeping
Blade
adds
6.78%
to
Resolve
with
its
base
movement.
This
means
that
it
will
charge
the
full
bar
with
15
dashes
without
wind
wall,
and
10/7/6/5/4
dashes
at
ranks
1
though
5.
Combining
the
above,
a
good
combo
could
be
to
walk
towards
a
ranged
target,
let
resolve
take
the
first
hit,
then
dash
though
the
minions
to
build
damage,
close
the
gap,
and
rebuild
your
Flow.
Wind
Wall
blocks
all
ranged
attacks
that
hit
it,
not
necessarily
only
from
the
direction
that
you
cast
it.
So,
running
around
the
wind
wall
while
against
a
ranged
champion
is
a
great
way
to
block
all
of
their
damage.
Wind
Wall
is
also
able
to
block
Baron
Nashor's
attacks,
making
it
a
great
ability
to
use
against
him.
Last
Breath
can
only
be
used
when
an
enemy
champion
is
airborne.
However,
the
knock-up
isn't
limited
to
Yasuo's
third
Steel
Tempest
cast
allies
abilities
can
be
used
as
well.
The
full
list
of
skills
that
allow
Yasuo
to
use
Last
Breath
is
in
the
skills
description
on
the
champions
main
page.
The
blink
has
a
long
range,
you
can
make
use
of
it
as
a
gap
closer.
Build
usage
Yasuo
is
usually
played
as
a
solo
laner,
mid
or
top.
Alternatively,
he
can
be
the
AD
carry
bot
lane
or
the
jungler,
but
neither
is
recommended
due
to
the
difficulties.
As
a
damage
source
for
his
team,
Yasuo
can
quickly
become
lethal
by
purchasing
crit
chance,
attack
damage
and
attack
speed.
Because
Yasuo's
Way
of
the
Wanderer
will
double
his
crit
chance
and
his
Steel
Tempest
may
crit,
every
item
that
provides
crit
becomes
more
gold
efficient
in
his
hands
than
any
other
item
in
the
game
.
Infinity
Edge
,
Statikk
Shiv
and
six
Greater
Marks
of
Critical
Chance
will
total
100%
but
at
a
cost
of
6300
gold.
Because
Statikk
Shiv
is
built
from
Avarice
Blade
,
this
is
the
fastest
path
possible
due
to
the
bonus
gold
generation.
Statikk
Shiv
,
Infinity
Edge
,
and
a
simple
Brawler's
Gloves
would
also
give
you
106%
crit
chance
(which
is
capped
at
100%).
Statikk
Shiv
has
major
synergies
with
Steel
Tempest
(Q)
by
providing
crit
chance,
attack
speed
and
the
lightning
passive.
The
crit
chance
is
doubled
to
40%
by
Way
of
the
Wanderer
and
Q
can
crit.
The
attack
speed
reduces
the
Q's
cooldown.
The
Shiv
charges
itself
as
an
on-hit
effect
and
the
Q
applies
those
to
the
first
target
hit.
When
the
Shiv
is
fully
charged,
the
lightning
is
also
an
on-hit
effect,
so
the
Q
can
proc
the
bolt.
Statikk
Shiv
is
usually
rushed
in
many
games.
Every
aspect
of
it
fits
Yasuo
perfectly
and
is
highly
recommended.
Once
a
player
learns
the
range
of
his
Steel
Tempest
,
Statikk
Shiv
makes
Yasuo
an
extremely
hard
champion
to
lane
against
due
to
his
extreme
harassment
abilities
with
Statikk
Shiv
.
While
Yasuo
has
many
low
cooldown
abilities,
making
Sheen
easy
to
proc,
it
cannot
crit,
the
mana
is
wasted,
and
the
AP
is
less
useful.
Thus
it,
and
Trinity
Force
,
are
generally
not
recommend,
in
favor
of
higher
Crit,
AD,
or
AS
items.
Cooldown
Reduction
is
generally
less
valuable
stat
on
Yasuo
,
since
Steel
Tempest
is
reduced
by
attack
speed
and
Sweeping
Blade
mark
cannot
be
reduced.
However,
it
can
still
be
useful
since
Wind
Wall
and
Last
Breath
have
no
cost.
Reducing
the
cooldown
of
Last
Breath
can
be
quite
powerful
if
your
teammates
can
regularly
launch
people.
Since
Yasuo
does
a
lot
of
auto-attack
damage
(including
his
Q),
life
steal
from
The
Bloodthirster
,
Ravenous
Hydra
,
or
Blade
of
the
Ruined
King
,
would
be
very
good
to
have.
The
Bloodthirster
will
deal
the
most
damage,
making
it
the
choice
for
for
single
targets.
Ravenous
Hydra
will
deal
slightly
less
damage,
but
allow
for
very
quick
wave
clearing,
and
a
stronger
burst
with
its
active.
Note
that
the
splash
damage
does
not
crit.
Blade
of
the
Ruined
King
will
do
the
least
damage
out
of
the
3
(unless
you
have
4000+
HP
targets),
but
has
a
good
active
ability
that
can
be
useful
for
chasing
or
escaping.
Due
to
him
being
susceptible
to
crowd
control,
either
Mercury's
Treads
(more
defensive)
or
Zephyr
(more
of
a
glass
cannon)
are
recommended.
Mercurial
Scimitar
can
also
be
very
valuable,
especially
against
a
heavy
magic
team.
Due
to
potentially
high
physical
damage,
armor
penetration
from
a
The
Black
Cleaver
and/or
Last
Whisper
would
be
a
very
good
idea.
Guinsoo's
Rageblade
is
potentially
exploitable
by
Yasuo
because
his
Q
costs
nothing,
does
not
require
a
target,
and
has
a
cooldown
lower
than
the
stack
expiration.
This
allows
Yasuo
to
keep
8
stacks
perpetually.
However,
he
does
not
make
good
use
of
the
AP.
Banshee's
Veil
can
greatly
reduce
Yasuo
vulnerability
to
being
bursted
down
and
allow
Yasuo
time
to
engage.

Since
he
relies
heavily
on
critical
attacks,
Reinforced
Armor
is
an
ideal
mastery
to
take.
Wind
Wall
can
be
potentially
devastating
to
Mages
and
Marksmen
alike.
Champions
that
can
quickly
reposition
themselves
through
or
around
the
wall
(such
as
Ahri
,
LeBlanc
,
Ezreal
,
etc)
can
largely
nullify
it.
Be
very
careful
about
using
global
projectile
ultimates
such
as
Enchanted
Crystal
Arrow
and
Super
Mega
Death
Rocket!
when
Yasuo
is
in
the
vicinity.
Only
use
them
when
you
know
Wind
Wall
is
on
cooldown
or
Yasuo
isn't
near
the
target.
This
also
goes
for
initiation
abilities
such
as
Rocket
Grab
,
Zap!
,
or
Death
Sentence
.
Wind
Wall
blocks
many
skillshots
and
targeted
abilities,
but
it
does
not
block
instantaneous
abilities
like
Final
Spark
,
"overhead"
abilities
like
Mega
Inferno
Bomb
,
and
terrain-based
abilities
like
Tormented
Soil
.
Knowing
what
can
bypass
his
Wind
Wall
can
give
you
a
great
advantage.
Yasuo's
Steel
Tempest
has
a
narrow
hitbox,
but
the
whirlwind
has
deceptively
long
range.
Dodge
to
the
side
to
avoid
the
knockup.
Way
of
the
Wanderer
can
generate
a
very
strong
shield
as
Yasuo
levels
up,
but
it
lasts
for
a
very
brief
duration.
Treat
it
like
a
Banshee's
Veil
and
pop
it
with
one
of
your
lesser
abilities
before
fully
engaging
on
Yasuo
.
Yasuo's
Last
Breath
only
works
against
bonus
armor;
building
health
instead
can
mitigate
the
effect
of
his
ultimate.
Like
any
Marksman
or
ADC,
focusing
Yasuo
with
hard
CC
can
make
him
very
easy
to
kill.
His
Sweeping
Blade
can
also
be
interrupted
with
hard
CC.
If
your
aim
is
good,
don't
be
afraid
to
launch
your
CC
at
him
while
he's
dashing.
This
is
especially
true
because
Yasuo
can't
use
Wind
Wall
mid-dash.
While
a
capable
fighter
on
his
own,
Yasuo's
kit
makes
him
one
of
the
most
team
composition-reliant
champions
in
the
League.
Take
note
of
his
allies
to
gauge
just
how
much
of
a
threat
Yasuo
will
be.
As
a
melee
ADC
with
an
ability
that
scales
based
on
Attack
Speed
(
Steel
Tempest
)
as
the
center
of
his
kit,
items
like
Randuin's
Omen
and
Frozen
Heart
can
have
a
big
impact
on
Yasuo's
damage
output.
On
top
of
being
dependent
on
Attack
Speed,
Yasuo's
Steel
Tempest
is
considered
an
autoattack
and
therefore
proc's
Thornmail
.
This
will
allow
him
to
receive
massive
amount
of
recoil
due
to
the
dependency
of
his
damage
output
on
Steel
Tempest
.
