The
unforgiving
northern
reaches
of
the
Freljord
are
home
to
the
Ursine,
a
fierce
and
warlike
race
that
has
endured
the
barren
tundra
for
thousands
of
years.
Their
leader
is
a
furious
adversary
who
commands
the
force
of
lightning
to
strike
fear
within
his
foes:
Volibear.
Both
a
warrior
and
a
mystic,
Volibear
seeks
to
defend
the
ancient
ways
and
the
warrior
spirit
of
his
tribe.
Though
history
recorded
their
once
legendary
feats
in
battle,
the
Ursine
now
lived
in
tranquil
seclusion.
The
warriors
were
headed
by
a
triumvirate
of
leaders
who
maintained
a
long-lived
isolation,
avoiding
the
petty
affairs
and
conflicts
of
others.
As
shaman
to
the
three,
Volibear
was
a
respected
sage
known
for
his
insight.
It
was
an
era
of
unprecedented
peace,
but
Volibear
felt
dread
stirring
within
him.
Prosperity
was
turning
the
tribe
soft
and
weak,
and
many
had
long
forgotten
the
sacred
art
of
war.
In
time,
Volibear
felt
the
fire
of
their
souls
would
be
extinguished.
When
he
revealed
his
misgivings
to
the
triumvirate,
they
refused
to
listen
and
warned
him
to
know
his
place.
Seeking
wisdom,
Volibear
undertook
a
perilous
climb
to
the
peak
of
the
Ursine's
sacred
mountain,
a
place
forever
shrouded
in
a
thundering
maelstrom.
The
eye
of
the
storm
was
said
to
bestow
portents,
and
legend
held
that
the
tempest
would
mark
the
next
great
chieftain
of
the
tribe.
As
Volibear
ascended
the
peak,
he
was
struck
by
an
unnatural
bolt
of
lightning.
When
the
shaman
awoke,
he
was
possessed
by
a
horrific
vision
of
the
Freljord
utterly
consumed
by
darkness.
Volibear
saw
an
unprepared
and
complacent
Ursine
force
slaughtered
by
terrible
creatures
of
ice.
In
an
instant,
he
knew
his
race
would
perish
if
they
did
not
prepare
for
war.
Volibear
rushed
down
the
mountainside
to
recount
what
he
had
seen,
but
found
the
path
blocked
by
three
Ursine
-
the
triumvirate.
Knowing
he
would
end
the
lasting
peace,
they
refused
to
heed
Volibear's
warning
and
demanded
his
silence,
by
his
word
-
or
his
death.
Resolute
and
adamant,
Volibear
swore
that
the
Ursine's
very
survival
depended
on
his
message,
and
launched
into
ferocious
combat
against
the
three.
A
terrible
clash
ensued,
and
just
as
Volibear
succumbed
to
his
opponents,
he
called
upon
the
power
of
the
maelstrom.
Unleashing
raw
lightning,
he
struck
the
trio
down
with
a
thunderous
blow.
Stunned
and
astonished,
the
triumvirate
beheld
the
sign
of
Ursine
leadership:
the
force
of
the
sacred
storm.
Recognizing
his
foretold
ascendance,
the
triumvirate
appointed
Volibear
as
the
Ursine's
new
leader.
His
influence
was
swift
and
decisive:
he
roused
his
tribe
from
complacency,
revived
their
battle-hardened
traditions,
and
allied
with
Sejuani
,
the
warrior
who
would
fight
with
them
against
the
coming
evil
.
With
time,
the
tribe
grew
lean
and
fierce,
becoming
known
again
as
fearsome
warriors
of
legend.
Volibear
and
the
Ursine
now
stand
ready
for
the
dark
day
that
looms
on
the
icy
horizon.
"The
Ursine
cannot
know
peace
without
war."
―
Volibear
Though
the
northern
reaches
of
Freljord
are
some
of
the
most
unforgiving
lands
in
Valoran
,
the
Ursine
have
survived
upon
the
region's
barren,
stormy
tundra
for
centuries.
As
a
fierce
and
respected
warrior
of
the
Ursine,
Volibear
devoted
his
life
to
the
protection
of
his
people
and
loyalty
to
his
elder
brother,
the
tribe's
chief.
When
his
brother
was
killed
during
a
hunt
on
the
tundra,
the
tribe
looked
to
Volibear
as
his
successor.
It
was
an
honor
and
a
burden
that
Volibear
had
never
expected,
but
he
shouldered
the
charge
with
pride.
However,
by
Ursine
tradition,
the
tribe
could
not
recognize
Volibear
as
chief
until
he
returned
from
a
journey
to
the
peak
of
their
sacred
mountain,
a
place
forever
shrouded
in
a
thundering
maelstrom.
There,
Ursine
chieftains
must
speak
to
the
storm
itself,
gaining
clarity
and
wisdom
to
empower
them
as
mighty
leaders.
Donning
the
chieftain's
traditional
armor
and
enchanted
gauntlets,
Volibear
began
the
long
and
perilous
climb
up
the
slopes
of
the
mountain.
When
he
reached
the
peak
and
gazed
into
the
raging
storm
above,
he
saw
a
horrific
vision
of
a
Freljord
utterly
consumed
by
war.
Amidst
the
carnage,
the
Ursine
fell
dead
upon
a
bloody
battlefield.
Believing
the
vision
to
be
an
omen
of
things
to
come
if
he
did
not
act
against
them,
Volibear
traveled
to
the
capital
of
Freljord.
The
Ursine
had
not
ventured
across
the
southern
mountains
in
centuries
and
his
appearance
was
met
with
unease.
However,
Queen
Ashe
recognized
Volibear
as
a
wise
and
powerful
ally.
In
what
Volibear
considered
the
first
step
against
a
war-torn
future,
they
forged
an
alliance.
As
part
of
their
agreement,
he
joined
the
League
of
Legends
in
the
name
of
a
unified
Freljord,
representing
the
primal
might
of
his
nation
on
the
Field
of
Justice
.

can
weather
the

that

Volibear
Teaser
Every
once
in
a
while,
there
comes
a
champion
so
controversial
that
even
the
executives
can’t
agree
on
what
to
do
with
them.
Some
might
claim
that
the
combination
of
two
awesome
elements
can
only
yield
up
an
even
greater
awesome
of
truly
epic
proportions,
while
others
might
cling
to
the
superstition
that
too
much
awesome
isolated
in
one
particular
being
can
only
lead
inevitably
to
disaster.
The
two
awesome
elements
that
we’re
talking
about
in
this
case
are,
of
course:
bears
and
gigantic
suits
of
armor.
For
many
of
you,
Volibear,
the
Thunder’s
Roar
is
no
doubt
the
best
news
you
will
get
in
the
time
of
your
natural
lives.
For
others,
we
understand
the
anxiety
that
might
accompany
the
thought
of
facing
down
a
massive,
armored
bear.
If
you’re
one
of
those
summoners
afflicted
by
a
phobia
of
bear
armory,
we’ve
arranged
to
include
the
following
comic
to
help
you
face
down
your
fears.
Ursine
enthusiasts
everywhere
rejoice!
Your
bear
in
shining
armor
has
nearly
arrived!
