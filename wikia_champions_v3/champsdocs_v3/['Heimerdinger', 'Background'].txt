Current
meteorological
conditions
in
Bandle
City
seem
optimal.
Atmospheric
pressure
is
ideal
for
today's
experiments!
Running
a
fifth
trial
for
my
Tridyminiumobulator
this
afternoon.
Some
fine
tuning
is
required;
singed
my
mustache.
Need
to
adjust
the
energy
throughput.
16:00
Tridyminiumobulator
is
still
not
maintaining
intended
proper
energy
efficiency!
Necessary
to
run
more
numbers.
In
the
meantime,
I
have
found
something
else
that's
very
intriguing.
While
returning
home
after
today's
tests,
I
passed
a
gaggle
of
young
yordles
throwing
a
spherical
projectile
at
each
other.
It's
a
simple
enough
concept:
throw
the
object
at
someone,
catch
it,
throw
it
at
another
yordle,
repeat.
But
yordle
miscalculations
result
in
several
errors!
They
throw
with
inconsistent
accuracy
and
force,
and
the
"ball"
(as
they
refer
to
it)
is
frequently
dropped
...
There
are
many
ways
for
this
process
to
be
improved.
According
to
my
calculations,
and
after
collecting
data
from
the
participants,
if
the
pitching
was
consistent
in
both
speed
and
arc
there
would
be
a
44.57%
increase
to
fun!
I
need
to
ponder
this
for
the
evening.

Eureka!
I've
devised
a
solution.
I've
invented
an
automated
ball
pitcher.
Current
name:
H-28G
.
It
employs
a
consistent
speed
and
trajectory,
ensuring
that
the
recipient
will
always
be
able
to
catch
the
ball.
It
redirects
itself
to
the
nearest
yordle
(if
there
is
more
than
one
in
the
vicinity)
ensuring
everyone
has
a
turn.
I'll
take
it
to
the
young
yordles
today
and
demonstrate
my
invention.
Also:
spilled
toxic
acid
on
my
shoes
this
morning.
Bothersome.
10:30
Tested
the
automated
pitcher
today.
It
did
not
go
as
planned.
The
young
ones
were
excited
enough
about
my
invention,
but,
when
the
machine
was
turned
on,
it
was
far
too
powerful!
Even
at
its
lowest
setting
it
completely
knocked
a
yordle
off
his
feet.
Clearly,
I
overestimated
the
velocity
behind
their
throws
...
I'll
return
soon
to
make
adjustments.
But
my
priority,
for
now,
is
the
Tridyminiumobulator;
I
must
fix
its
complications
before
lunch.
Once
it's
in
good
shape,
I'll
need
to
test
it
somewhere
else.
Bandle
City
is
proving
insufficient
for
field
research.

Apparently,
there's
a
giant
in
town.
A
highly
annoying
anomaly.
The
noise
outside
is
disturbing
my
research!
Must
check
fish
tank
today.
They've
been
strangely
quiet
...

I
have
heard
that
many
yordles
have
been
injured
due
to
the
giant-related
disturbance.
If
this
doesn't
stop
soon,
intervention
will
be
necessary!
I
hope
H-28G
is
still
intact.
I
would
lose
a
lot
of
time
if
it
has
to
be
rebuilt.
16:30
Everything
is
quiet
again.
It
seems
that
the
giant
came
to
his
senses
and
ran
off.
I
need
to
gather
H-28G
tomorrow,
once
I've
finished
with
more
pressing
matters.
I've
almost
perfected
the
Tridyminiumobulator!

Today
has
been
quite
eventful
already.
I
was
surprised
by
a
knock
at
my
door.
It
seemed
like
the
entire
city
was
standing
in
front
of
my
house.
Normally,
when
a
crowd
has
gathered,
it's
because
they
have
some
petty
grievance
about
my
work.
But
this
time,
they
were
celebrating!
Astonishingly,
it
seems
one
of
the
young
yordles
took
advantage
of
the
H-28G
prototype
I
had
left
behind
amidst
the
giant
tomfoolery.
He
proved
to
be
innovative,
and
repurposed
the
invention
into
a
makeshift
turret.
It's
powerful
enough
to
scare
off
a
giant
imagine
that!
What
an
ingenious
little
fellow.
I
wish
I
could
employ
his
like-minded
encephalon
in
the
near
future
I
have
big
plans
and
his
assistance
could
be
valuable
but
he'd
have
to
leave
Bandle
City.
The
scope
of
my
plans
necessitates
a
more
expansive
testing
ground.
Runeterra
should
suffice!
―The
Journal
of
Professor
Cecil
B.
Heimerdinger
It
is
unusual
to
see
yordles
outside
of
Bandle
City
,
but
the
lure
of
science
was
something
Heimerdinger
could
not
resist.
By
the
time
he'd
completed
his
third
doctorate,
he
had
already
become
the
greatest
of
all
yordle
scientists
and
there
was
little
his
home
could
still
offer
him.
The
great
academies
of
Piltover
far
to
the
north
called
to
him,
daring
him
to
make
his
mark
in
the
City
of
Progress.
Knowing
he
would
never
thrive
away
from
his
own
kind,
Heimerdinger
gathered
like-minded
yordles
to
join
him
in
his
quest,
thus
forming
the
backbone
of
the
now
famous
Yordle
Academy
of
Science
&
Progress.
Since
then,
he
has
become
one
of
the
most
respected
minds
of
the
modern
age
and
his
academy
is
one
of
the
leading
institutions
in
all
of
Valoran
.
Heimerdinger
has
pioneered
many
new
scientific
achievements,
delving
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
field
of
techmaturgy,
including
the
development
of
the
now
ubiquitous
star-rods
that
light
many
of
the
streets
of
the
city-states.
However,
there
is
something
strange
about
the
Revered
Inventor.
In
his
quest
to
expand
knowledge,
he
underwent
an
experiment
of
his
own
design
to
allow
him
to
use
a
greater
portion
of
his
brain
simultaneously.
It
most
certainly
worked,
but
at
an
unusual
cost
-
Heimerdinger's
brain
increased
in
size.
His
head
changed
along
with
it
and
now
the
great
scientist
looks
like
a
yordle
with
a
giant
brain-shaped
head.
Heimerdinger
has
turned
his
attentions
to
the
current
state
of
war
on
Valoran,
however,
and
works
to
rectify
what
he
considers
is
an
unacceptable
situation.
Heimerdinger
believes
that
science
is
the
key
to
saving
the
world.
Much
more,
he
has
rolled
up
his
sleeves
and
is
out
to
prove
this
as
a
member
of
the
League
of
Legends
–
most
definitely
as
the
League's
smartest
champion!
