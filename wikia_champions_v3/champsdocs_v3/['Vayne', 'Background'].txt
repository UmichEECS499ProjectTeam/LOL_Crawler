The
world
is
not
always
as
civilized
as
people
might
think.
There
are
still
those
who
would
follow
the
blackest
paths
of
magic
and
become
corrupted
by
the
darker
powers
that
flow
through
Runeterra
.
Shauna
Vayne
knows
this
fact
well.
As
a
young
privileged
girl
in
the
heart
of
Demacia
's
elite,
her
father
tried
to
convince
her
of
the
constabulary's
ever-vigilant
eye.
Young
and
naive,
she
truly
believed
that
her
world
was
one
of
perfect
safety,
until
one
night,
when
a
twisted
witch
took
interest
in
her
father.
The
malevolent
woman
overcame
her
father's
conciliar
guard,
then
tortured
her
family
before
murdering
them.
The
young
Shauna
escaped
only
by
hiding
herself
and
then
fleeing
once
the
hag
had
departed,
plagued
by
the
screams
of
her
loved
ones
as
she
ran.
A
burning
hatred
was
born
in
her
that
day,
one
that
could
never
be
denied.
Vayne
was
able
to
take
care
of
herself
using
her
father's
money,
and
she
began
to
train
as
soon
as
an
instructor
would
have
her
as
a
student.
By
the
time
she
was
a
fully
grown
woman,
she
had
become
a
grim
warrior.
However,
the
fields
of
battle
were
not
to
be
her
home.
Demacia
needed
a
protector,
one
who
hunted
those
lost
to
the
darkness.
Shauna
used
her
family's
contacts
to
become
the
first
Night
Hunter,
and
now
her
prowess
is
the
stuff
of
legends.
It
is
said
that
those
who
practice
the
black
arts
quake
when
they
hear
that
the
Night
Hunter
is
on
the
prowl.
Despite
her
crusade,
Shauna
has
looked
at
the
League
of
Legends
in
horror.
There
are
champions
who
have
clearly
lost
themselves
to
the
blackest
of
magics,
and
who
have
been
embraced
within
the
League
even
though
they
should
be
put
down
for
the
safety
of
all.
The
time
has
come
for
the
Night
Hunter
to
execute
her
secret
mission
-
to
purge
the
League
of
Legends.
"Not
all
shadows
are
to
be
feared.
At
least,
if
Vayne
has
her
way."

CLE
OBSERVATION
She
doesn't
need
to
bend
to
examine
the
road.
The
witch's
trail
is
obvious,
even
by
moonlight.
That
last
silver
bolt
had
hit
home,
if
the
blood
is
any
indication.
The
prey
is
slowed.
The
trail
leads
her
past
a
public
house.
Though
a
few
of
the
patrons
cast
wary
glances
as
she
walks
past,
the
ruckus
will
cover
up
any
unwanted
noise.
She
hopes
none
of
them
have
the
sense
to
call
the
constabulary
before
she's
done.
The
glow
from
the
end
of
the
alley
reveals
her
prey.
The
witch
is
attempting
to
use
hemomancy
to
close
her
wounds.
From
the
looks
of
things,
more
than
one
of
the
silver
bolts
has
landed.
However,
now
the
witch
sees
her
and
the
magic
changes.
Droplets
of
blood
fly
towards
her
like
a
cloud
of
razors,
but
she
effortlessly
tumbles
over
a
barrel
and
out
of
the
way.
Her
crossbow
is
up
before
her
feet
even
touch
the
ground
and
she
fires.
The
bolt
flies
true,
impaling
the
witch's
casting
hand
and
halting
her
vile
spells.
"Haley
Manner,
you
have
fallen
to
the
practice
of
the
black
arts.
You
have
willingly
harmed
others.
You
are
condemned."
She
does
not
wait
for
the
witch
to
respond
with
lies.
She
draws
the
great
crossbow
over
her
shoulder
and
unleashes
its
massive
projectile.
It
strikes
the
witch
with
such
force
that
it
carries
her
back
and
into
the
wall
of
the
public
house,
impaling
her
there,
limp
and
silent
at
last.
She
can
already
hear
the
hue
and
cry.
Though
she
is
an
agent
of
justice
–
many
would
say
vengeance
–
Vayne's
activities
are
not
sanctioned
by
Demacian
law.
Nimbly,
she
leaps
up,
grabs
hold
of
a
ledge,
and
flips
herself
on
top
of
the
building.
Leaping
from
roof-top
to
roof-top,
she
fades
away
into
the
darkness.
Such
is
the
way
of
the
Night
Hunter.
REFLECTION
The
summoners
stared
at
her
uneasily.
After
all,
few
potential
champions
have
ever
broken
into
one
of
the
inner
sanctums
of
the
Institute
of
War,
startled
powerful
summoners,
and
plainly
demanded
to
be
allowed
into
the
League
of
Legends.
Fortunately,
Vayne's
reputation
had
preceded
her,
so
there
was
no
need
for
violence.
The
room
in
which
she
sat
now
was
sparse
–
nothing
more
than
a
fireplace
with
a
few
chairs.
Vayne
reflexively
adjusted
the
crossbow
on
her
arm.
"When
do
we
begin?"
she
asked.
The
summoner
who
seemed
to
be
in
charge
of
this
process
turned
away
from
the
fire.
He
was
a
gracefully
aging
man,
approaching
middle-age,
with
a
quiet
authority
borne
of
true
power.
"In
moments.
First,
I
want
to
ask
you
how
you
managed
to
get
past
our
defenses
to
gain
access
to
the
deeper
chambers
of
the
Institute."
"The
same
way
I
know
that
you
are
Senior
Summoner
Ezekiel
Montrose
and
that
the
woman
with
you
is
Summoner
Lessa
Carin.
The
same
way
I
know
that
you
take
rose-hip
tea
every
day,
the
route
you
walk
to
your
home,
and
that
you
sleep
on
a
very
uncomfortable
bed.
I
am
the
Night
Hunter.
Now
get
on
with
it.
I
have
already
submitted
to
your
authority."
After
a
moment
of
stunned
silence,
Senior
Summoner
Montrose
finally
spoke.
"Since
you
are
not
one
for
pleasantries..."
In
an
instant,
it
was
as
if
the
world
had
exploded.
Then,
as
quickly
as
it
came
apart,
it
was
back
together
again.
However,
it
was
many
years
ago,
when
Vayne
was
just
a
girl.
She
was
back
in
the
cupboard
again.
"Come
out,
little
girl.
Come
out,
or
I
will
do
to
mummy
what
I
have
already
done
to
daddy."
The
crone
suspended
her
mother
above
the
floor
of
the
moonlit
kitchen,
the
poor
woman's
limbs
painfully
and
helplessly
outstretched.
Blood
slowly
dripped
from
her,
dribbling
from
a
hundred
impossibly
small
cuts.
The
young
Shauna
Vayne
was
too
terrified
to
move.
There
she
was,
trapped,
frozen,
and
forced
to
watch
through
a
crack
in
the
cupboard
door
as
the
twisted
witch
brutally
tortured
the
woman
she
loved
more
than
any
other.
"I'll
give
you
one
last
chance
to
come
out,
lassie."
To
punctuate,
the
crone
made
some
mystical
gesture
that
caused
her
mother
to
cry
out
in
agony.
Even
if
she'd
wanted
to,
Shauna
couldn't
even
cry
out.
The
vise-like
grip
of
fear
prevented
that.
The
crone
cackled,
the
horrible
sound
echoing
off
the
walls.
"You
are
an
awful
child,
girl,
to
make
your
mummy
die
this
way."
With
each
more
horrifying
shriek
of
pain
and
suffering
that
issued
from
her
mother,
something
warm
and
bright
in
Vayne
died.
However,
in
its
grave
were
planted
the
first
seeds
of
a
searing,
merciless,
and
never-ending
hatred...
Disorientation,
a
blur
of
reality,
and
she
was
back
in
the
Institute
of
War.
Senior
Summoner
Montrose
did
his
best
to
keep
his
composure,
while
all
the
color
had
drained
from
Summoner
Carin's
face.
He
broke
the
silence
first.
"I'm
sorry
for
your
loss."
Vayne
took
several
measured
steps
towards
him.
"Stay
out
of
my
head,
summoner,"
she
said
in
a
surprisingly
even
tone.
"You
won't
like
what
you
find
in
the
shadows."
"We
must,"
replied
Summoner
Carin,
whose
tiny
frame
carried
a
core
of
inner
strength.
"It
is
the
way
of
the
Judgment.
How
does
it
feel
exposing
your
mind?"
However,
Senior
Summoner
Montrose
raised
his
hand
to
stop
her.
"I
think
the
answer
to
that
is
obvious,
Lessa.
Shauna
Vayne,
let
me
ask
you
one
simple
question.
Why
do
you
want
to
fight
in
the
League
of
Legends."
"To
know
my
enemies.
Though
your
magics
keep
them
alive
through
defeat,
I
will
learn
more
hunting
those
champions
who
are
abominations
than
I
would
hunting
their
inferiors
in
the
world."
Senior
Summoner
Montrose
considered
her
for
a
moment.
"You
will
be
a
part
of
the
League
of
Legends,
Night
Hunter.
However,
you
must
never
violate
our
trust
again.
Agreed?"
Vayne
only
nodded
in
assent.
With
that,
she
turned
and
walked
from
the
room.
Summoner
Carin,
confused
for
a
moment,
followed
shortly
behind
her.
A
voice
spoke
from
the
shadows.
"I
do
not
trust
her.
Her
mind
is
not
an
open
book.
She
will
only
show
us
what
she
wants
us
to
see."
Emerging,
as
if
one
with
the
darkness
around
him,
stepped
Senior
Summoner
Sander
Grieve.
The
intense-looking
man
was
clad
entirely
in
black,
the
Noxian
cloak-clasp
the
only
clue
as
to
his
heritage.
"Yes,"
replied
Montrose.
"But
I
would
rather
have
her
here
where
we
can
watch
her."
Grieve
sighed.
"This
will
end
badly.
Mark
my
words."
Montrose
gave
Grieve
a
piercing
stare.
"End
badly
for
whom?"

Vayne
sneak
peak
If
there’s
anything
that
League
of
Legends
has
taught
us,
it’s
that
not
all
champions
fight
with
swords
and
shields
on
epic
battlefields
alongside
vast
armies.
There
are
those
who
are
capricious
elemental
forces,
others
who
are
powerful
and
scheming
mages,
a
few
who
are
full-fledged
monsters,
and
still
some
who
dart
and
weave
through
dark
city
streets,
silent
vigilantes
on
a
quest
to
rid
the
world
of
vile
villains.
And
while
we're
on
the
subject
of
the
shadowy,
silent
types,
if
you
find
yourself
drawn
to
dark,
dexterous
figures
who
walk
the
fine
line
between
good
and
evil,
you'll
love
Vayne,
the
Night
Hunter.
Just
don't
sneak
up
on
her
in
a
hurry
to
make
an
introduction!
I
hear
that
these
types
can
be
jumpy!

V3.15
:
Condemn
Fixed
a

was
being
moved
by
a
spell
when
Condemn's

hit
(dash,
