Trivia
Aatrox
was
designed
by
Classick
.
[3]
Aatrox's
name
comes
from
the
Latin
word
atrox
,
meaning
fierce,
savage
and
cruel.
The
English
word
atrocity
comes
from
the
word
atrox.
The
word
atrox
is
also
derived
from
ater
meaning
dark,
which
may
be
an
influencing
factor
in
naming
his
species
Darkin.
Aatrox's
lore
is
similar
to
Ares
,
the
God
of
War
in
Greek
mythology
.
An
Ancient
Mystery
In
Runeterra
,
Aatrox's
sneak
peak,
was
posted
under
the
name
of
Ezreal
,
in
a
similar
fashion
to
how
Journey
Into
The
Freljord
,
Lissandra's
sneak
peak,
was
posted
by
Quinn
.
The
nature
of
his
blade
bears
a
resemblance
to
the
Soul
Reaver
from
the
Legacy
of
Kain
series.
Both
appear
to
be
living
weapons
and
can
consume
the
life
force
of
their
wielder
and
drain
the
life
force
of
their
enemies.
Additionally,
the
charged
sound
effect
on
his
Blood
Thirst
ability,
closely
resembles
the
sound
made
by
the
Spirit
Reaver
form
of
the
Soul
Reaver.
A
shadowy
figure
resembling
Aatrox
can
be
seen
in
Darius'
classic
splash
art,
as
well
as
an
updated
version
of
Jax's
classic
splash
art
found
on
the
beta
version
of
LeagueOfLegends.com.
While
both
shadowy
figures
resemble
each
other,
there
are
enough
differences
between
the
figure
and
Aatrox
that
it
could
be
another
of
the
five
darkin.
Aatrox
is
the
fifth
champion
who
uses
health
as
a
primary
resource
for
casting
abilities.
The
other
four
champions
are
Dr.
Mundo
,
Mordekaiser
,
Vladimir
,
and
Zac
.
Aatrox
is
the
fifteenth
champion
that
can
increase
their
attack
range
.
Aatrox's
attacks
remain
melee.
Aatrox
is
one
of
the
five
remaining
Darkin,
an
ancient
race.
Of
the
five,
he
is
currently
the
only
known
Darkin.
However,
only
three
members
of
the
Darkin
race
are
known
to
history
(including
Aatrox).
Riot
has
stated
the
Aatrox
was
in
some
ways
inspired
by
the
Balrog
and
Sauron
from
The
Lord
of
the
Rings
franchise,
including
his
walk
animation.
[4]
When
reaching
a
certain
amount
of
movement
speed,
Aatrox's
movement
animation
shows
him
gliding
instead
of
running.
Aatrox
seems
to
view
the
wars
he
causes
as
a
form
of
art,
as
several
of
his
quotes
refer
to
the
fights
as
"work"
"masterpieces"
and
other
synonyms
for
art.
When
Aatrox
uses
his
ultimate,
you
can
faintly
hear
it
no
matter
where
you
are
on
the
map.
Quotes
Aatrox's
quote
"Rage
against
the
dying
of
the
light."
is
a
direct
reference
to
the
poem
"
Do
not
go
gentle
into
that
good
night
"
by
Dylan
Thomas
.
An
audio
clip
can
be
found
here
.
Aatrox's
quote
"I
know
what
lurks
in
the
hearts
of
man"
is
a
reference
to
the
character
The
Shadow
created
by
Walter
B.
Gibson
-
"Who
knows
what
evil
lurks
in
the
hearts
of
men?
The
Shadow
knows..."
His
quote
"Peace
is
the
greatest
lie
of
all"
could
reference
the
Sith
Code
from
Star
Wars
-
"Peace
is
a
lie,
there
is
only
passion..."
.
Aatrox
has
two
special
quotes
for
Tryndamere
,
as
a
reference
to
his
presence
and
influence
in
Tryndamere's
lore.
Skins
Justicar
Aatrox
shares
the
Justicar
theme
with
Justicar
Syndra
.
Justicar
Aatrox
is
meant
to
resemble
Aatrox
through
the
depictions
of
him
by
the
people
whom
he
saved.
Relations
Aatrox
is
the
dark
figure
alluded
to
in
Tryndamere's
new
lore,
who
possessed
a
living
weapon
and
inspired
unhinged
bloodlust
into
those
who
fought
alongside
him
using
unearthly
magic.
The
information
surrounding
the
Freljordian
bone
dagger
and
his
quotes
seems
to
also
support
this.
