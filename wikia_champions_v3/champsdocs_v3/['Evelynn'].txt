seconds,
Evelynn
enters

only
being
able
to
be
seen
by
enemy
champions
within
700
range
or
true
sight.
Evelynn
regenerates
1%
of
her

while

or

for

seconds.
Ability
Details
Shadow
Walk
is
a
self-buff
ability.
Additional
Information:
Evelynn's
movement
animation
is
changed
whenever
Shadow
Walk
is
active.
A
puff
of
purple
smoke
will
also
appear
whenever
Shadow
Walk
activates.
When
Shadow
Walk
is
active
a
grey
circle
apears
around
Evelynn
indicating
the
range
from
which
enemies
will
have
sight
of
her.
Whenever
Evelynn
approaches
a
visible
enemy
champion,
there
will
be
an
eye
hovering
above
the
enemy's
model,
that
is
only
viewable
by
Evelynn.
This
eye
changes
color
based
on
how
far
away
Evelynn
is
from
the
enemy
champion:
Yellow
means
Evelynn
is
close
to
being
revealed.
Red
means
Evelynn
is
being
revealed
to
the
enemy
team.
An
exclamation
symbol
will
appear
over
Evelynn,
that
is
viewable
by
Evelynn
and
her
allies,
when
being
revealed
by
at
least
one
visible
enemy
champion.
The
red
eye
will
not
appear
above
an
enemy
champion
regardless
how
close
he
stands
next
to
Evelynn,
if
she's
covered
by
brush
or
by
the
Fog
of
War
.
If
Evelynn's
Shadow
Walk
is
active
and
she
goes
in
the
detection
range
of
an
enemy
champion
she
has
no
sight
of,
she
will
be
seen
but
her
stealth
will
not
break.
If
Evelynn
is
in
stealth
close
to
an
enemy
champion
(yellow
eye
icon)
but
comes
into
the
range
of
an
enemy
Vision
Ward
,
the
enemy's
eye
icon
will
turn
red
and
the
exclamation
mark
will
appear
as
if
she
was
in
the
detection
range.
The
following
are
things
that
will
also
break
Evelynn
out
of
stealth.

certain
summoner
spells
:
Clarity
,
Exhaust
,
Heal
,
Ignite
,
Recall
,
Smite
and

items
or
using
Scrying
Orb
/
Farsight
Orb
will
not
break
Shadow
Walk's
stealth.
Capturing
a
neutral
altar
in
Twisted
Treeline
will
trigger
the
exclamation
mark
over
Evelynn
and
the
red
eye
hovering
above
the
altar,
making
Evelynn
visible
to
nearby
enemies.
Capturing
an
enemy
altar
instead
will
only
trigger
the
yellow
eye
hovering
above
the
altar,
but
will
