Lore
Centuries
ago,
an
ancient
water-dwelling
race
built
a
hidden
city
beneath
a
mountain
in
the
sea.
Though
these
creatures
had
their
enemies,
the
city
was
an
impenetrable
fortress,
and,
in
the
safety
it
provided,
they
grew
complacent.
Fizz,
however,
harbored
a
curious
spirit
that
could
not
be
satisfied
living
so
cushioned
a
life.
Unable
to
resist
the
allure
of
danger,
Fizz
had
a
habit
of
sneaking
out
of
the
city
to
look
for
trouble.
In
his
many
adventures
he
grew
to
be
a
powerful
fighter
with
a
sharp
cleverness
that
let
him
skirt
danger
with
ease.
One
day
Fizz
returned
to
find
the
city
abandoned:
his
people
had
vanished,
leaving
Fizz
without
a
clue
to
explain
their
disappearance.
With
nothing
left
in
the
city
to
keep
him,
Fizz
salvaged
an
enchanted
seastone
trident
from
the
ruins
and
set
out
alone.
Fizz
wandered
the
ocean
in
search
of
his
people
for
years,
using
the
skills
he'd
learned
during
his
adventures
as
a
young
boy
to
survive.
Finally,
Fizz
discovered
the
port
of
Bilgewater
.
He
was
fascinated
with
the
existence
of
life
above
the
water
and
could
not
resist
exploring
the
island.
In
his
endless
curiosity,
Fizz
inadvertently
meddled
in
the
affairs
of
the
humans
who
lived
there,
and
his
presence
did
not
go
unnoticed.
His
mischief
angered
many
residents
who
eventually
sought
to
capture
or
kill
him.
Fizz
found
himself
cornered,
and
he
prepared
to
return
to
the
sea
despite
the
fondness
he'd
come
to
hold
for
Bilgewater.
As
he
stood
at
the
docks,
a
massive
dragon-shark
attacked
the
port.
Fizz
defeated
the
beast,
using
his
resourcefulness
and
knowledge
of
the
creature's
weaknesses
to
his
advantage.
Having
earned
the
gratitude
and
respect
of
the
humans,
Fizz
decided
to
stay
in
Bilgewater.
To
further
serve
his
new
home,
he
joined
the
League
of
Legends
.
Fizz
makes
even
the
saltiest
sailors
of
Bilgewater
look
like
drunken
landlubbers
in
a
fight.
Good
thing
he's
on
our
side.

a
moment
before

dive

this

allow

Fizz,
the
Tidal
Trickster.
Just
when
you

it

there
comes
out
an
undersea

Announcement

by
Morello
:
"Greeting,
summoners!
At
Riot,
we
like
to
provide
a
variety
of
champion
styles,
archetypes,
and
roles.
Sometimes,
we
like
to
release
a
champion
with
an
understood,
defined
role
(such
as
Graves),
while
with
others
we
try
to
shake
up
the
traditional
roles
and
offer
a
different
way
to
impact
the
game.
Fizz,
the
Tidal
Trickster,
is
a
perfect
example
of
this.
He
splashes
down
somewhere
in
the
melee
assassin
space,
but
in
ways
that
change
the
role
a
bit
--
especially
compared
to
other
assassins
like
Akali
or
Talon.
Fizz
is
able
to
pressure
high-value
targets
like
an
assassin,
but
makes
frequent
use
of
evasive
abilities
and
favors
sustained
damage
over
burst.
This
creates
a
different
sort
of
hit-and-run
gameplay
style
that
allows
this
little
amphibian
to
dance
around
the
battlefield,
using
evasion
to
stay
alive
and
keep
the
opponent
guessing.
The
primary
way
Fizz
keeps
enemies
on
their
toes
is
with
Playful/Trickster
–
a
stance
that
has
him
pole
vault
on
the
end
of
his
trident
and
become
un-targetable.
Fizz
can
activate
the
ability
again
to
move
off
of
the
trident
in
any
direction
he
chooses,
dealing
(literally)
splash
damage
when
he
lands.
In
this
way
he
can
dodge
big
spells,
dodge
heavy
damage
in
teamfights,
and
escape
for
another
set
of
attacks
shortly
thereafter.
Proper
use
of
Playful/Trickster
rewards
good
reflexes
and
situational
awareness,
since
it
has
a
powerful
effect
and
short
duration.
Timing
is
everything.
Fizz
also
has
something
else
up
his
sleeve
that's
sure
to
impress,
and
is
slightly
out-of-role
for
an
assassin.
He
starts
by
tossing
a
seemingly-innocent
fish
that
sticks
to
a
target.
Then,
just
when
they
think
they're
safe,
it's
shark
time!
That's
right!
A
giant
shark
erupts
from
the
ground
and
chomps
down
on
the
target
and
nearby
friends.
There's
really
nothing
else
to
say
about
this
–
a
giant
shark
eats
them,
and
it's
awesome.
It'd
been
awhile
since
we'd
done
a
more
whimsical
character
with
a
lighthearted
theme,
and
Fizz
fits
the
bill
just
right.
Offering
both
a
unique
visual
style
and
innovative
gameplay
to
match,
Fizz
should
really
appeal
to
people
who
want
to
be
--
both
literally
and
figuratively
--
slippery."
