Kayle
Champion
Background
Strategy
Skins
&
Trivia
Skill
usage
Reckoning
is
powerful
even
at
lower
levels
and
Kayle
can
utilize
this
advantageous
ability
to
dominate
her
opponents
in
early
game;
caution
should
be
taken
in
its
use,
however,
as
it
is
a
mana-costly
spell
to
use
repeatedly.
Divine
Blessing
can
be
used
for
sustaining
in
lane
or
for
harrying
allies
to
a
position
or
lane
all
the
while
healing
them.
Righteous
Fury's
allows
Kayle
to
deal
damage
even
when
blinded
or
being
dodged,
as
the
magic
damage
on-hit
is
dealt
regardless
of
if
the
attack
damage
on-hit
is
being
negated.
Righteous
Fury's
will
damage
turrets
only
if
the
splash
damage
is
applied
indirectly,
such
as
when
creep
waves
directly
under
a
turret
are
attacked.
Righteous
Fury
causes
full
damage
to
all
other
structures
if
they
are
attacked
directly.
If
Righteous
Fury's
duration
ends
while
Kayle
is
in
the
middle
of
her
attack
animation,
she
will
hit
the
target,
but
neither
the
bonus
damage
nor
the
splash
will
be
dealt.
The
attack
is
considered
ranged.
It
is
possible
to
hit
enemies
easily
while
staying
at
the
back
of
your
minion
wave
by
using
Righteous
Fury
.
This
can
be
accomplished
because
not
only
does
the
splash
damage
'spill'
over
to
nearby
enemies
when
you
last
hit
a
minion,
but
also
allows
you
to
harass
melee
enemies.
Staying
behind
your
wave
in
this
fashion
will
let
you
wait
for
cooldowns
and
heal
yourself
or
allies.
Putting
a
point
into
Righteous
Fury
instead
of
Reckoning
at
level
one
may
improve
your
ability
to
harass
and
stay
in
lane
due
to
its
lower
mana
cost
and
more
continuous
effect/duration.
Use
Intervention
to
rescue
fleeing
allies,
Divine
Blessing
to
hasten
them,
and
Reckoning
to
slow
their
pursuers.
Intervention
is
also
an
effective
ability
to
bait
enemies
to
attack
or
turret
dive
at
low
health
making
them
commit
to
killing
your
ally
or
die.
It
may
not
always
be
best
to
Intervention
an
ally
when
they
are
nearly
dead.
If
they
are
about
to
receive
a
large
amount
of
burst
damage
(such
as
Annie's
combo),
shielding
them
will
absorb
more
damage
than
if
you
were
to
shield
them
just
before
death
(which
may
end
up
saving
their
life
or
prolonging
it
more
effectively
than
if
you
had
waited
until
the
last
second).
Intervention
will
not
grant
invulnerability
against
the
Nexus
Obelisk
.
Build
usage
Build
damage
first
and
then
attack
speed
items
as
it
is
inadvisable
to
commit
to
battles
in
the
laning
phase.
For
such
damage,
Hextech
Gunblade
is
a
good
choice.
Getting
an
item
with
mana
regeneration
at
the
beginning
of
the
laning
phase,
along
with
getting
at
least
one
rank
of
Divine
Blessing
allows
you
to
stay
in
your
lane
much
longer.
Cooldown
reduction
is
very
strong
on
Kayle
.
With
40%
CDR,
you
can
have
Righteous
Fury
always
active
since
its
duration
is
10
seconds
and
its
cooldown
is
reduced
to
9.6
seconds.
Nashor's
Tooth
in
conjunction
with
masteries
and
runes
is
easily
able
to
achieve
the
CDR
cap.
Using
attack
speed
and
ability
power
in
combination
with
Righteous
Fury
can
yield
devastating
results
in
teamfights.
Building
items
with
on-hit
effects
such
as
Blade
of
the
Ruined
King
will
boost
your
damage
output
on
top
of
Righteous
Fury
.
Pure
ability
power
Kayle
might
have
high
damage
in
Reckoning
and
useful
heals
but
combining
it
with
attack
speed
will
cause
Righteous
Fury
to
deal
high
amounts
of
damage
very
quickly.
Nashor's
Tooth
and
then
Rabadon's
Deathcap
will
give
Kayle
a
high
damage
output,
allowing
her
to
build
into
much
more
durable
items
afterwards.
Lich
Bane
proc
combined
with
the
first
blow
of
Righteous
Fury
and
Reckoning
can
be
used
to
instantly
kill
fragile
champions.
Tankier
ones
can
be
mauled
to
death
with
the
remaining
duration
of
Righteous
Fury
and
attack
speed
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
will
increase
her
already
high
base
health
(2092
at
level
18)
and
improve
the
slow
from
Reckoning
and
apply
slow
on
her
Righteous
Fury
autoattacks.
Kayle
can
also
play
a
supporting
role
with
items
that
provide
auras
to
benefit
both
yourself
and
your
allies.
In
particular,
Abyssal
Scepter
synergizes
well
with
Holy
Fervor
to
soften
up
enemies
for
your
allies.
Since
Kayle
receives
at
least
moderate
benefits
from
almost
every
stat
in
the
game,
Trinity
Force
is
quite
effective
on
Kayle
.
For
similar
reasons,
Guinsoo's
Rageblade
is
also
a
cost
effective
choice
on
Kayle
.
Runaan's
Hurricane
applies
Righteous
Fury
bonus
damage
against
the
secondary
targets,
causing
them
to
recieve
it
twice
(once
from
Fury
area
of
effect
and
once
from
Runaan
secondary
targets).
This
will
cause
secondary
targets
to
recieve
more
damage
than
the
primary
one
unless
Kayle
has
very
high
attack
damage
and
no
ability
power
.
Ravenous
Hydra
's
passive
does
not
take
effect
when
Righteous
Fury
is
active.
However,
Muramana
's
toggle
does.

Remember
that
Holy
Fervor
will
shred
your
armor
and
magic
resistance
if
left
unchecked.
Keep
this
in
mind
before
attacking
her.
The
combination
of
Reckoning
,
Holy
Fervor
and
very
likely
a
Guinsoo's
Rageblade
will
make
Kayle
very
potent
at
duels,
stronger
the
longer
the
duel
lasts.
If
she
starts
to
weaken
she
will
likely
use
Intervention
to
quickly
turn
to
tides
of
the
duel
and
kill
you.
Because
of
this
avoid
duels
that
last
too
long.
Kayle
has
very
fast
and
strong
snowball
skill,
make
sure
to
deny
her
kills
as
it
will
hasten
her
late-game
supremacy.
Watch
her
build
carefully
to
know
what
to
do:
If
she
is
AP
(most
likely
with
large
amounts
of
AS)
she
must
be
immediately
shut
down
as
she
will
scale
into
a
deadly
powerhouse
late-game,
but
is
very
weak
early.
All
her
damage
comes
from
Reckoning
and
Righteous
Fury
.
This
build
depends
heavily
on
Intervention
for
survivability
as
Kayle
is
fragile,
baiting
her
to
using
it
on
a
wounded
ally
and
switching
your
focus
onto
her
will
take
her
out
quickly.
If
she
is
AD
she
stands
strong
at
all
stages
of
the
game,
she
does
not
depends
much
on
her
skills
for
damage
and
is
somewhat
tanky,
she
deals
less
damage
than
an
average
top
laner
due
to
lack
of
AD
scaling
on
any
skill
apart
from
Reckoning
and
any
AS
or
AD
steroid.
Later
on
Kayle
will
become
akin
to
a
second
AD
Carry
albeit
with
the
ability
to
become
invulnerable,
make
sure
to
engage
her
in
planned
out
fights,
but
don't
fear
her
damage
output
much.
If
she
is
supporting
it's
very
likely
that
she
leaves
the
role
after
a
while,
most
likely
deviating
into
the
first
mentioned
build,
but
still
taking
care
of
wards
and
heals.
Facing
her
in
the
bot
lane
can
be
very
hard
if
you
are
unable
to
keep
your
distance,
so
be
sure
to
pick
a
mobile
or
long
ranged
champion
Kayle
is
especially
hard
to
beat
in
the
top
lane,
due
to
overly
outranging
almost
all
other
champions
here.
The
few
ranged
ones,
like
Jayce
,
and
the
ones
with
long-ranged
gap
closers,
such
as
Jax
or
Renekton
,
will
have
a
much
easier
time
against
her.
Avoid
duelling
her
late
game
as
she
will
most
likely
have
almost
finished
items.
She
excels
at
1v1's
due
to
her
Reckoning
and
Intervention
.
This
not
only
allows
her
deal
incredible
amounts
of
damage
against
you,
but
also
completely
negate
any
damage
you
can
deal
to
her.
Be
careful
with
Kayle's
Reckoning
and
Righteous
Fury
combo.
Both
of
these
spells
can
kite
you
if
combined
together.
Her
ultimate,
Intervention
blocks
any
form
of
damage
to
the
target
with
this
buff,
including
true
damage.
Wait
until
the
buff
wears
off
before
you
use
your
high-damaging
spell.
Never
underestimate
Kayle's
mobility.
Divine
Blessing
gives
her
movement
speed
and
Reckoning
will
slow
you
down,
allowing
her
to
outrun
you.
With
2092
health
at
level
18
Kayle
has
a
very
high
natural
health,
abilities
and
items
that
deal
%
of
max
health
as
damage
are
effective
against
Kayle
.
Try
to
force
Kayle
to
use
her
spells
and
then
back
off,
due
to
her
high
mana
costs
in
the
early
game.
Kayle
is
vulnerable
early
game,
burst
damage
can
easily
kill
her.
Kayle
can
use
Intervention
to
avoid
damage,
but
while
in
this
state
she
is
still
vulnerable
to
CC
effects.
Use
this
tactically
when
she
turret
dives
to
have
her
still
take
damage
when
Intervention's
short
duration
wears
off.
(2
/
2.5
/
3
seconds).
Because
Reckoning
is
her
only
nuke
buying
Banshee's
Veil
will
significantly
cripple
her
damage.
