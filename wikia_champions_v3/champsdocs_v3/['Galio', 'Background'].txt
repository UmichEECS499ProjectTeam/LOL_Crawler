Lore
Long
before
the
League's
regulation
of
such
magic,
mages
experimented
with
the
creation
of
artificial
life.
Now
forbidden,
instilling
golems
with
reason
was
once
not
so
uncommon
a
practice
amongst
the
more
expert
of
craftsmen.
One
such
visionary
was
the
Demacian
artificer,
Durand.
Peerless
at
crafting
sentient
beings,
Durand's
constructs
served
as
tireless
guardians
for
the
border
towns
of
his
beloved
city-state,
affording
them
protection
from
their
Noxian
neighbors.
For
his
own
defense,
however,
Durand
kept
his
magnum
opus:
Galio.
This
mighty
construct
forged
in
the
image
of
a
gargoyle
kept
him
safe
on
his
journeys,
allowing
him
to
perform
his
important
work
without
fear
of
reprisal
from
those
hostile
to
his
homeland.
That
is,
until
dealing
with
his
taxing
sentinels
finally
roused
the
ire
of
the
Noxian
High
Command.
As
Durand
crossed
the
Howling
Marsh
with
his
masterwork
in
tow,
he
was
set
upon
by
Noxian
assassins
in
force.
Outnumbered
and
overwhelmed,
Galio
looked
on
in
horror
as
the
murderers
cut
down
his
charge,
executing
him
swiftly
before
vanishing
back
into
the
mists.
Stripped
of
his
reason
for
being,
Galio
despaired.
For
years
he
remained
in
solitude,
standing
vigil
over
the
bones
of
the
master
he
had
failed
to
protect...
a
literal
monument
to
his
own
everlasting
shame.
Then,
on
one
nondescript
day,
a
sad
but
determined
yordle
girl
carrying
a
mighty
Demacian
crown
stopped
in
the
shadow
of
a
great
statue
to
rest.
Hidden
in
plain
sight
from
his
unsuspecting
visitor,
Galio
studied
the
forlorn
yordle.
She
looked
as
though
she
too
shouldered
a
tremendous
burden.
As
quietly
and
as
stoically
as
she
had
arrived,
she
departed
in
the
direction
of
Demacia.
This
encounter
lit
a
spark
in
Galio's
eye.
Remembering
the
cause
that
his
master
had
died
defending,
Galio
arose
from
his
silent
purgatory
and
followed
in
the
wake
of
this
brave
creature.
He
had
a
new
reason
to
live:
to
join
the
League
of
Legends
and
fight
for
the
will
of
Demacia.
"There
is
no
such
thing
as
redemption.
Only
penance."
―
Galio

CLE
OBSERVATION
Galio
wears
a
face
as
though
he
is
lost
in
concentration.
One
may
mistake
this
look
to
mean
the
great
beast
is
dumbfounded.
His
facial
features,
especially
his
massive
jaw
with
the
exaggerated
underbite,
give
the
massive
gargoyle
the
look
of
a
simpleton.
This
look
is
intentionally
deceptive,
magically
crafted
to
lull
an
opponent
into
thinking
that
Galio
is
mentally
slow.
The
reality
of
the
situation
is
that
he
is
intently
studying
what
lies
before
him.
The
double
doors
–
and
the
sign
above
it
–
are
all
that
matters.
“The
truest
opponent
lies
within.”
Galio
nods
knowingly,
but
does
not
move
afterwards.
His
form
is
literally
statuesque.
After
a
lengthy
pause,
Galio
springs
to
life,
lumbering
toward
the
door.
Broad,
powerful
wings
spread
wide
and
slowly
beat
against
the
stillness
of
the
air,
propelling
the
gargoyle
forward
with
a
not-so-gentle
whoosh.
He
moves
as
gracefully
as
a
being
made
of
stone
and
metal
can.
The
doors
swing
open,
revealing
the
inky
blackness
within.
The
engraved
obsidian
panthers
that
flank
the
doorway
point
the
way
inward
for
Galio.
He
obliges
his
stony
brethren.
REFLECTION
With
a
sudden
flood
of
light,
Galio
knew
where
he
was.
There
was
never
a
chance
of
him
forgetting
this
place.
The
clearing
was
surrounded
by
a
thick
copse
of
fruit
trees.
In
the
center
of
the
clearing
were
Durand’s
bones,
blanched
from
countless
days
of
weathering.
He
could
smell
the
peaches
and
cherries
ripening
on
the
branches.
Galio
loathed
that
smell;
the
stench
of
sweet
fruit
growing,
ripening,
and
rotting
in
a
never-ending
cycle
reminded
him
of
his
failure
to
save
Durand,
his
creator.
He
had
failed
to
protect
his
master
from
the
Noxian
assassins
who
ambushed
them,
and
it
was
here
that
he
kept
a
penitent
vigil
for
years
afterwards.
I
wish
they
killed
me
instead.
He
thought
it
now
as
he
did
back
then,
but
this
time
he
knew
something
was
different.
An
unwelcome
thought
masquerading
as
his
own
edged
its
way
into
his
consciousness.
No.
I
do
not.
Galio
shifted
in
place,
trying
to
shake
the
invasive
notion
out
of
his
head.
He
knew
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
actually
be
here,
but
everything
felt
real.
The
sickly-sweet
scent
of
the
fruit
made
him
anxious.
Was
this
still
the
Judgment?
“It
is,
Galio
of
Demacia.”
The
squeaky,
yet
powerful
yordle
voice
belonged
to
a
female.
Sitting
on
a
nearby
stump
was
a
familiar
face.
He
recognized
the
female
yordle,
but
she
was
not
wearing
what
Galio
remembered
her
wearing
when
they
first
met
on
this
very
spot.
She
wore
the
armor
of
a
Demacian
warrior.
He
now
knew
the
yordle
as
Poppy,
though
when
he
first
met
her
he
did
not
know
her
name.
He
never
spoke
to
Poppy
then;
in
fact,
he
never
even
let
her
know
that
he
was
aware
of
her
presence.
Poppy
had
seen
Galio
standing
in
the
clearing,
but
she
never
gave
any
indication
that
she
thought
he
was
anything
more
than
an
inanimate
statue.
“You
are
Poppy.”
Galio
spoke
with
words
that
were
carefully
chosen.
“I
know
you.
This
was
before
you
joined
the
League.
I
saw
you.
Here.”
The
yordle
girl
smiled,
though
she
shook
her
head
slightly.
“Here...
yes,
you
met
Poppy
here,
but
alas
–
I
am
not
Poppy.”
The
yordle
girl
stood
and
approached
Galio,
extending
her
hand.
“You
know
this
to
be
true.”
The
girl
smiled
again.
“It’s
okay
if
you
want
to
keep
calling
me
Poppy.”
Galio
had
watched
this
place
for
years,
but
for
the
first
time,
he
permitted
himself
an
examination
of
the
environment
without
analyzing
for
ambush
points
or
areas
of
defensive
weakness.
A
sudden
slight
breeze
carried
the
scent
of
the
trees
away.
He
could
hear
leaves
gently
rustling.
He
noticed
how
the
drifting
blossoms
twirled
with
each
pulse
of
the
wind.
Galio
extended
his
talon-like
paw
and
took
the
yordle
girl’s
tiny
hand
into
his
own.
He
could
feel
the
warmth
of
her
flesh
on
his
sculpted
hide.
“Thank
you,
Poppy.”
She
nodded.
“Why
do
you
want
to
join
the
League,
Galio?”
The
pungent
fruit
smell
wafted
back
into
the
clearing,
making
Galio
slightly
jittery.
“I
must
fight
for
Demacia.
It
was
my
creator’s
home.”
Poppy
clasped
the
gargoyle’s
remaining
free
hand.
As
she
stood
facing
Galio,
she
looked
up
at
him
with
kind,
yet
serious
eyes.
“Why
do
you
want
to
join
the
League,
Galio?”
Galio
thought
carefully
about
Poppy’s
question;
he
knew
this
was
not
the
real
Poppy,
but
he
could
surmise
that
her
image
was
being
used
for
a
reason.
He
remembered
that
it
was
the
sight
of
the
determined
yordle
that
broke
him
from
his
exile.
He
knew
that
she
herself
bore
a
tremendous
burden.
It
was
the
same
sort
of
burden
that
he
too
struggled
to
cope
with
–
the
burden
of
failure.
Galio
had
later
learned
that
Poppy
lost
her
father
in
an
ambush
also
perpetrated
by
Noxian
assassins.
They
had
such
a
horrific
event
in
common,
but
they
addressed
it
so
differently.
Poppy
became
even
more
resolute
to
complete
her
mission
–
to
deliver
a
crown
crafted
by
her
father
to
a
Demacian
general.
Galio
chose...
a
different
path.
He
now
realized
that
it
was
his
choice
and
his
choice
alone
to
stand
vigil
not
over
the
remains
of
his
creator,
but
rather
over
his
own
hubris.
He
looked
away
from
Poppy
for
a
moment,
ashamed.
He
now
knew
the
answer.
“I
want
to
join
because
it
is
my
choice.
It
is
my
own
free
will.
I
want
to
fight
for
my
creator’s...
for
my
home.”
“How
does
it
feel,
exposing
your
mind?”
The
pungent
odor
had
dissipated
once
more.
Galio
looked
down
upon
Poppy,
smiling
a
slightly
fanged
grin.
“It
is...
familiar
to
me.
I
shared
my
mind
with
my
creator.
I
am
sharing
my
mind
with
you.
I
will
share
my
mind
with
any
summoner.”
Another
flood
of
light
washed
over
Galio.
He
stood
alone
in
front
of
a
new
set
of
double
doors.
There
was
no
pause
this
time
–
Galio
swung
the
doors
wide
and
entered
the
League
of
Legends.

Champion
Sneak
Peek
Announcement
made
in
the
sneak
peak
by
ByronicHero
:
With
this
next
champion
we
had
a
couple
of
goals
in
mind.
For
starters,
we
wanted
to
show
our
continued
commitment
to
the
monster
enthusiasts
by
bringing
those
monstrous
champions
into
the
lineup.
On
the
other
hand,
we
wanted
to
appeal
to
those
sensitive
types
who
don't
identify
with
anything
that's
capable
of
vomiting
toxic
bile
,
devouring
its
victims
whole
,
or
shaking
the
very
ground
on
which
it
treads
.
We
know
that
it's
a
pretty
tall
order,
but
we're
pretty
sure
that
Galio,
the
Sentinel's
Sorrow,
should
just
be
able
to
bridge
that
gap.
If
you're
a
fan
of
monsters,
just
imagine
a
swooping,
deadly
predator
perched
on
the
edge
of
a
building,
waiting
patiently
to
strike.
And
if
you're
one
of
those
artsy
types
who
doesn't
appreciate
the
grotesque,
well
then,
think
of
him
as
a
piece
of
elegant
statuary.

The
Underworld
Has
a
Doorman
Announced
by
NeeksNaman
:
Summoners!
Sometimes
your
travels
around
the
world
of
Valoran
are
going
to
take
you
on
the
road
to
some
exotic
locales.
If
you
stumble
upon
this
menacing,
red
version
of
Galio
in
your
travels,
however,
the
odds
are
good
that
you’ve
taken
a
wrong
turn
–
especially
if
he's
perched
on
top
of
a
massive,
terrifying
gate
that’s
emanating
an
eerie
green
glow.
Then
you
might
want
to
consult
your
cartographer
to
find
out
why
he
plotted
you
a
course
to
the
gates
of
the
underworld
before
you
set
off.
Of
course,
with
the
Legendary
Gatekeeper
Galio
standing
watch,
you
might
just
want
to
be
grateful
you’re
not
trapped
on
the
other
side.
