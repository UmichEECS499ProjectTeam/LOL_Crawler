Taric
Champion
Background
Strategy
Skins
&
Trivia
Lore
There
is
a
form
of
magic
unknown
to
many
Runeterrans
and
discredited
by
the
few
who
are
even
aware
of
its
existence.
It
is
the
magic
of
the
earth,
drawing
power
from
the
resonance
of
crystals
and
gems.
Taric,
the
Gem
Knight,
is
Runeterra's
sole
practitioner
of
this
form
of
magic,
having
been
erratically
summoned
to
Runeterra
from
a
faraway
world.
Back
home,
Taric's
father
was
a
distinguished
healer
in
their
home
city.
Taric
was
always
interested
in
his
father's
pursuits,
even
from
a
young
age.
Despite
his
burgeoning
understanding
of
herbs,
plants,
and
animal
medicines,
it
was
the
power
of
gems
that
most
fascinated
the
growing
boy.
It
wasn't
long
before
Taric
had
exhausted
his
father's
coveted
library
and
set
out
on
a
path
of
his
own.
He
wanted
to
help
the
people,
but
not
simply
salving
their
wounds
and
curing
their
woes.
He
wasn't
to
be
a
healer,
but
a
defender
-
one
who
used
the
power
of
earth
to
preserve
and
protect.
Taric
became
a
wandering
knight,
renowned
across
his
homeland
as
a
guardian
of
the
just
until
the
day
a
spell
of
summoning
grabbed
him
from
his
home
and
deposited
him
on
Runeterra.
Though
disoriented
and
confused
at
first,
he
now
feels
that
the
continent
of
Valoran
is
in
need
of
someone
like
him.
Despite
missing
his
homeland,
Taric
is
happy
to
fight
in
the
League
,
serving
as
a
protector
for
all
who
seek
one.
His
neat
and
stylish
appearance
combined
with
his
shiny
bejeweled
armor
and
weapons
have
rapidly
made
him
a
celebrity
champion
of
the
League
of
Legends.
Valoran's
media,
for
some
reason,
has
taken
great
interest
in
his
personal
life.
While
open
about
his
life
as
a
champion
and
gracious
in
all
things,
Taric
is
tight-lipped
about
his
life
outside
the
League
and
prefers
his
privacy.
"As
Taric's
father
taught
him,
every
stone
has
its
meaning.
For
Taric's
enemies,
they
all
mean
trouble."
Prior
to
V1.0.0.116
:
There
is
an
ancient
form
of
magic,
forgotten
by
many
and
discarded
by
some.
It
is
the
magic
of
the
earth,
of
the
resonance
of
crystals
and
gems.
Taric's
father
was
a
healer
in
their
city,
on
a
world
far
away.
Taric
was
always
interested
in
his
father's
pursuits,
even
from
a
young
age.
Despite
his
burgeoning
understanding
of
herbs,
plants,
and
animal
medicines,
it
was
the
power
of
gems
that
most
fascinated
the
growing
boy.
It
wasn't
long
before
Taric
had
exhausted
his
father's
coveted
library
and
set
out
on
a
path
of
his
own.
He
wasn't
to
be
a
healer,
but
a

-
one
who
used
the
power
of
the
earth
to
preserve
and
protect.
Quickly,
Taric
became
a
wandering
knight,
renowned
across
the
land.
That
is,
until
the
day
a
spell
of
summoning
grabbed
him
from
his
home
and
deposited
him
on
Runeterra
.
Now,
Taric
misses
his
world,
though
he
is
happy
to
fight
in
the
League
,
protecting
all
who
are
in
need.
"As
Taric's
