Skill

For
best
burst
damage
try
combining
the
third
hit
from
Silver
Bolts
and
the
bonus
damage
from
Tumble
in
the
same
attack.
Because
of
Vayne's
Night
Hunter
,
it
is
fairly
easy
to
chase
down
champions
for
the
third
hit.
Try
an
auto
attack
>
Tumble
>
Condemn
combo
for
a
fast
and
relatively
safe
proc
of
Silver
Bolts
.
This
combo
is
very
mana
heavy
so
be
selective
when
using
this
combo(doesn't
apply
after
patch
3.14).
Be
mindful
that
harassment
doesn't
require
the
full
combo.
Zoning
with
a
tick
of
Silver
Bolts
may
be
more
effective
than
getting
all
three
ticks.
This
may
be
an
useful
tactic
to
use
in
lane
due
to
Vayne's
low
health
pool
and
defenses.
Tumble
can
be
used
to
dodge
skillshot
abilities.
Tumble
is
also
effective
at
dodging
delayed
damage
abilities
like
Rupture
or
Pillar
of
Flame
.
If
you're
fighting
near
an
allied
turret
,
try
to
Tumble
behind
the
opponent
and
then
Condemn
them
into
your
turret's
range.
Same
can
be
done
to
push
an
enemy
towards
your
team.
Don't
forget
that
Night
Hunter
only
works
facing
the
enemy
and
with
that
combined
with
your
ultimate
makes
it
very
hard
for
the
enemy
to
escape
you.
Activating
Final
Hour
to
triple
the
bonus
movement
speed
from
Night
Hunter
is
an
effective
way
to
catch
escaping
enemies.
Do
not
overestimate
Vayne's
mobility.
Night
Hunter's
bonus
movement
speed
grants
no
bonus
while
running
away
from
enemies,
and
Tumble
doesn't
go
on
cooldown
until
you
actually
attack
an
enemy
which
essentially
adds
6
seconds
of
cooldown
that
you
can't
reduce
with
cooldown
reduction
when
you
are
using
it
to
run
away.
Tumble
cannot
cross
most
wall
terrain
(though
it
can
cross
Cataclysm
,
Crystallize
,
Event
Horizon
or
Pillar
of
Ice
).
Tumble
can
cross
impassable
terrain
such
as
the
small
ledge
near
dragon
pit
if
you
position
correctly.
Note
that
Tumble's
extra
damage
only
activates
upon
attacking
enemy
units,
not
structures.
You
can
escape
in
the
midst
of
a
battle
by
using
Final
Hour
and
Tumble
to
stealth
and
confuse
the
enemy.
It
is
recommended
to
change
direction
than
the
one
you
where
running
in
or
to
choose
an
alternate
route.
Because
she
is
squishy,
it
is
highly
recommended
to
opt
for
more
defensive
summoner
spells
,
such
as
Ghost
,
Cleanse
,
or
Barrier
.
Flash
is
very
desirable.
Final
Hour
in
conjunction
with
Tumble
,
which
only
stealths
for
1
second,
doesn't
make
for
a
very
good
escape.
These
summoner
spells
can
also
assist
in
chases.
Condemn
will
stun
the
target
if
it
hits
a
terrain,
a
turret
,
an
inhibitor
or
a
nexus,
but
will
NOT
stun
with
Cataclysm
,
Crystallize
or
the
turrets
in
Dominion.
Using
Condemn
on
a
retreating
enemy
may
help
them
escape.
Be
sure
to
position
Vayne
where
the
knock
back
effect
will
let
your
team
or
yourself
engage
on
the
enemy.
Tumble
or
Flash
can
help
with
positioning
yourself
for
a
successful
Condemn
.
Condemn
could
also
be
used
when
Vayne
loops
to
the
back
of
the
target
and
knock
them
towards
allies.
Using
Condemn
in
jungle
fights
can
be
much
more
effective
than
in
lane
fights
due
to
the
tight
spaces
making
it
easy
to
land
the
second
effect
and
stunning
an
opponent.
Build
usage
Building
Sheen
or
Trinity
Force
can
add
some
significant
burst
to
Tumble
.
Starting
with
Phage
provides
much
needed
survivability
and
can
assist
in
running
from
or
toward
a
target
if
Vayne
procs
it
on
an
enemy
minion.
Building
Zeal
first
grants
her
added
mobility
and
attack
speed
to
more
easily
farm
and
proc
Silver
Bolts
.
Vayne
has
zero
abilities
which
scale
with
ability
power
,
so
consider
this
fact
when
deciding
what
order
to
buy
items
in.
Berserker's
Greaves
are
an
especially
good
choice
as
the
attack
speed
is
beneficial
for
proc-ing
Silver
Bolts
.
Purchasing
Mercury's
Treads
may
be
a
good
idea
when
facing
teams
with
a
wide
range
of
crowd
control
abilities.
A
commonly
held
misconception
is
that
due
to
Silver
Bolts
dealing
true
damage,
Vayne
does
not
need
to
purchase
Last
Whisper
to
deal
with
tanks,
instead
only
needing
more
attack
speed
.
This
is
somewhat
not
true,
as
most
calculations
with
endgame
builds(
based
on
low
elo
games
)
have
True
Damage
only
composing
around
7-10%
of
her
total
damage.
Moreover,
an
attack
speed
reliant
build
without
a
Last
Whisper
is
very
easily
countered
by
a
Randuin's
Omen
,
as
it
will
constantly
negate
25%
of
attack
speed
as
well
as
have
a
strong
amount
of
armor
that
the
Vayne
player
does
not
have
penetration
for.
Infinity
Edge
provides
a
substantial
boost
to
Vayne's
damage
output
from
auto
attacks.
Remember
that
critical
hits
don't
proc
from
Condemn
and
don't
scale
from
Tumble's
bonus
damage.
The
Bloodthirster
provides
much
needed
lifesteal
to
aid
her
survivability
and
scales
with
her
Tumble
and
Condemn
.
Alternatively,
getting
an
early
Blade
of
the
Ruined
King
can
benefit
Vayne
due
to
the
increased
attack
speed
and
incredible
item
active
for
damage
and
chasing/escaping.
Phantom
Dancer's
attack
speed
and
critical
strike
chance
synergize
well
with
Silver
Bolts
and
increase
the
effectiveness
of
Final
Hour
,
as
well
as
boosting
her
DPS
quite
a
bit.
Additionally
the
movement
speed
boost
from
Phantom
Dancer
scales
with
the
additional
movement
speed
from
Night
Hunter
,
including
the
boost
to
it
from
using
Final
Hour
.
Enchanting
your
boots
with
the
Furor
enchantment
allows
Vayne
to
kite
or
escape
very
well.
Tumble
away
and
whenever
the
enemy
comes
within
range
of
an
autoattack
hit
them
once
to
start
the
tumble
cooldown
and
rush
away
with
your
furor
bonus,
tumbling
once
it's
off
cooldown.
Furor
also
strongly
boosts
Vayne's
chasing
ability.

Countering
Choosing
someone
such
as
Miss
Fortune
or
Caitlyn
who
have
strong
early
games
can
easily
deny
Vayne
from
farming
as
Vayne
has
a
relatively
weak
early
game.
Avoid
pushing
the
lane
as
Vayne's
Tumble
makes
her
an
exceptional
farmer
under
turret,
and
has
strong
chasing
potential.
Vayne's
entire
kit
is
focused
on
dueling
(or
1v1ing)
and
chasing
so
deny
her
the
potential
to
duel
with
you
and
her
kit
will
naturally
round
out
lategame
when
teamfights
become
dominant,
where
the
fights
become
more
stationary
and
targets
become
harder
to
focus.
Once
Vayne
obtains
Final
Hour
at
level
6,
her
dueling
potential
increases
exponentially
and
she
essentially
"jumps"
to
her
mid-game
potentially
immediately
before
most
other
Attack
Damage
Carries.
The
Attack
Damage
and
movement
speed
boosts
are
huge
given
how
early
in
the
game
it
is
and
stealth
detection
is
much
harder
to
afford
earlier
on.
Respect
her
presence
at
level
6
if
you
haven't
pulled
a
significant
advantage
over
her
and
avoid
dueling
her
if
possible.
Vayne
is
one
of
the
most
powerful
duelists
in
game
and
is
well
known
and
feared
as
one
of
the
most
powerful
marksman
if
fully
build.It
is
critical
to
keep
her
early
and
mid
game
crippled.
Marksmen
are
usually
easy
prey
to
one-burst-wonder
assassins,
especially
Zed
and
LeBlanc
.
Vayne
is
by
far
not
in
this
category,
her
ability
to
carefully
move
around
the
battlefield,
drain-tank
while
evading
attacks
with
stealth
from
Final
Hour
and
bursting/peeling
with
Condemn
makes
her
complicated
to
kill
by
surgical,
tactical
and
careful
assassins
as
she
can
often
prevent
their
abilities
to
properly
flow
for
a
combo.
Silver
Bolts
is
relatively
easy
to
counteract
contrary
to
popular
belief.
Her
Silver
Bolts
procs
rely
on
her
attack
speed.
Champions
with
attack
speed
slows
such
as
Malphite
,
Lee
Sin
,
and
Nunu
can
mitigate
Vayne's
auto
attack
and
Silver
Bolts
damage
significantly
along
with
having
kits
that
counteract
Vayne
extremely
well.
Malphite
tends
to
stack
armor
to
synergize
with
his
Brutal
Strikes
and
his
Unstoppable
Force
has
a
cast
and
AoE
range
that
outrange
Vayne's
Tumble
and
Condemn
.
Vayne's
relatively
high
movement
speed
from
Night
Hunter
and
Final
Hour
also
become
her
undoing
thanks
to
Seismic
Shard's
movement
speed
steal.
Lee
Sin's
kit
provides
extreme
stealth
detection
and
Cripple
shuts
down
Vayne's
mobility.
Nunu's
Ice
Blast
and
Absolute
Zero
also
shut
down
Vayne's
mobility
and
make
her
an
easy
target
to
focus.
Frozen
Heart
is
extremely
detrimental
to
Vayne
because
the
armor
portion
of
the
item
counters
her
lack
of
magic
damage
and
the
long-ranged
-20%
attack
speed
aura
is
practically
unavoidable
in
teamfights.
Randuin's
Omen
is
also
especially
useful
against
Vayne
as
one
proc
of
slow
will
significantly
cripple
her
true
damage
and
mobility.
Because
Vayne
relies
on
her
mobility
in
order
to
survive
in
teamfights
due
to
her
short
range,
the
movement
speed
slow
will
make
her
an
easy
target
to
focus.
As
such,
even
building
an
early
Warden's
Mail
will
have
noticeable
effects
against
her.
Vayne's
Silver
Bolts
do
not
account
for
shields
when
calculating
the
percent
of
maximum
HP
so
abilities
such
as
Granite
Shield
and
Titan's
Wrath
are
extremely
strong
against
her.
The
same
case
goes
for
lifesteal
and
high
health
regeneration;
if
the
target's
lifebar
isn't
noticeably
large
but
is
constantly
renewed
from
either
high
lifesteal
or
abilities
such
as
Sadism
,
the
damage
from
Silver
Bolts
becomes
significantly
less
noticeable.
Battling
her
only
in
teamfights
forces
her
to
switch
targets,
resulting
in
fewer
Silver
Bolts
procs.
Mages
with
targeted
burst
damage/crowd
controls
such
as
LeBlanc
or
Ryze
can
easily
dispatch
Vayne
as
her
mobility
and
Tumble
are
primarily
anti-skillshot
oriented.
Targeted
abilities
that
apply
targeted
hard
crowd
control's
such
as
Warwick's
Infinite
Duress
and
Malzahar's
Nether
Grasp
prevents
Vayne
from
retaliating
with
her
mobility
and
lifesteal
resulting
in
an
easy
kill.
Ryze
is
especially
effective
because
Frozen
Heart
is
a
core
item
in
his
build
and
his
Rune
Prison
shuts
down
Vayne's
mobility
and
Tumble
,
which
also
shuts
down
her
stealth
when
Final
Hour
is
active.
It's
recommended
not
to
fight
Vayne
in
the
jungle
as
there
are
more
walls
for
her
to
stun
with
her
Condemn
.
Taking
a
Vision
Ward
with
you
or
activating
an
Oracle's
Lens
is
useful
against
Final
Hour
as
her
stealth
will
be
useless,
shutting
down
her
primary
method
of
reaching
squishier
targets
of
interest.
