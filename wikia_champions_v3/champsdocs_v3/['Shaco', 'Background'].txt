Most
would
say
that
death
isn't
funny.
It
isn't,
unless
you're
Shaco
-
then
it's
hysterical.
He
is
Valoran's
first
fully
functioning
homicidal
comic;
he
jests
until
someone
dies,
and
then
he
laughs.
The
figure
that
has
come
to
be
known
as
the
Demon
Jester
is
an
enigma.
No
one
fully
agrees
from
whence
he
came,
and
Shaco
never
offers
any
details
on
his
own.
A
popular
belief
is
that
Shaco
is
not
of
Runeterra
-
that
he
is
a
thing
summoned
from
a
dark
and
twisted
world.
Still
others
believe
that
he
is
the
demonic
manifestation
of
humanity's
dark
urges
and
therefore
cannot
be
reasoned
with.
The
most
plausible
belief
is
that
Shaco
is
an
assassin
for
hire,
left
to
his
own
lunatic
devices
until
his
services
are
needed.
Shaco
certainly
has
proven
himself
to
be
a
cunning
individual,
evading
authorities
at
every
turn
who
might
seek
him
for
questioning
for
some
horrendous,
law-breaking
atrocity.
While
such
scuttlebutt
might
reassure
the
native
inhabitants
of
Valoran,
it
seems
unimaginable
that
such
a
malfeasant
figure
is
allowed
to
remain
at
large.
Whatever
the
truth
of
his
history
might
be,
Shaco
has
joined
the
League
of
Legends
for
reasons
only
he
knows.
He
is
a
terrifying
figure,
typically
shunned
by
both
his
fellow
champions
and
the
media
at
large.
Only
the
summoners
in
the
Institute
of
War
know
why
such
a
creature
was
allowed
into
the
League,
but
most
Runeterrans
suspect
it
to
be
a
means
that
allows
the
power
that
be
to
keep
an
eye
on
the
ever-elusive
Shaco.
Unsurprisingly,
this
champion
is
popular
in
places
where
madness
can
openly
reign,
such
as
among
the
power-hungry
summoners
of
Zaun
and
Noxus
.
"Whatever
you
do,
don't
tell
him
you
missed
the
punch
line."
They
say
that
death
isn't
funny.
It
isn't,
unless
you're
Shaco.
He
is
Valoran
's
first
fully-functioning
homicidal
comic;
he
jests
until
someone
dies,
and
then
he
laughs.
The
figure
that
has
come
to
be
known
as
the
Demon
Jester
is
an
enigma.
No
one
still
alive
knows
whence
he
came.
There
are
rumors,
but
one
must
not
speak
of
them
too
loudly
lest
Shaco
come
to
jest.
It
seems
unimaginable
that
such
a
threatening
figure
would
be
allowed
to
remain
at
large.
There
are
those
that
believe
he
is
an
assassin
for
hire,
left
to
roam
until
he
is
needed.
Others
believe
that
Shaco
is
simply
too
clever,
evading
authorities
at
every
turn.
Still
others
believe
that
he
is
the
demonic
manifestation
of
humanity's
dark
urges,
and
therefore
cannot
be
stopped.
"Whatever
you
do,
don't
tell
him
you
missed
the
punch
line."
