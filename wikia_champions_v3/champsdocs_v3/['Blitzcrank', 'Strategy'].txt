Skill
usage
Mana
Barrier
can
be
a
great
source
of
survivability
if
itemized
for,
and
its
low
cooldown
ensures
it
is
almost
always
up
for
skirmishes.
Do
not
rely
on
Mana
Barrier
in
the
laning
phase,
due
to
Blitzcrank's
low
base
mana
and
high
costs.
During
a
gank/fight,
consider
conserving
your
mana,
to
increase
the
effectiveness
of
Mana
Barrier
.
Rocket
Grab
is
Blitzcrank's
signature
skill,
with
immense
utility
when
used
well.
Rocket
Grab
has
a
distinctive
cast
sound;
try
casting
it
out
of
enemy
sight
to
avoid
them
hearing
it.
Aim
your
shots
from
unexpected
angles
to
increase
their
chances
of
landing,
such
as
through
an
enemy
minion
about
to
die.
Blitzcrank
can
allow
your
team
to
invade
the
enemy
jungle
at
the
start
of
the
match
due
to
the
threat
you
pose
with
Rocket
Grab
.
With
perfect
warding
placement
at
your
enemies
tribush
or
jungle,
Rocket
Grab
can
be
used
to
steal,
or
to
get
a
kill
with
your
team
mates.
Avoid
hitting
certain
champions
that
would
benefit
from
getting
pulled
into
your
team
as
a
free
initiation,
such
as
Amumu
,
Galio
,
or
Karthus
.
If
you
are
about
to
grab
an
enemy
with
silencing
effects,
you
may
want
to
activate
Power
Fist
before
the
grab
to
ensure
the
combo.
At
level
2,
Rocket
Grab
and
Power
Fist's
crowd
control
can
easily
help
your
lane
get
kills.
You
can
also
use
this
combination
to
punish
enemies
who
towerdive.
Use
Overdrive
to
get
Blitzcrank
on
top
of
priority
targets
to
lock
them
down
with
Power
Fist
.
Static
Field's
passive
damage
is
deceptively
high
over
the
course
of
a
fight,
so
try
to
not
use
the
active
until
necessary.
You
will
want
to
use
Static
Field's
active
when
you
can
hit
most
of
the
enemy
team,
when
the
silence
is
needed
to
interrupt
an
enemy
channeled
spell,
or
when
it
can
finish
off
a
foe.
If
you
know
that
an
enemy
champion
plans
to
dodge
your
Rocket
Grab
with
Flash
or
a
dash
ability,
activate
Static
Field
to
silence
them
before
grabbing.
You
can
stand
in
front
of
enemy
minions
where
the
enemy
thinks
they
are
safe,
and
then
use
Static
Field
to
clear
the
minion
wave
and
use
Rocket
Grab
.
Blitzcrank
players
will
generally
want
to
max
their
Overdrive
and
Power
Fist
as
priorities;
Rocket
Grab
does
its
job
at
rank
1
by
pulling
enemies
into
Blitzcrank's
melee
range,
where
his
other
two
basic
abilities
make
him
very
difficult
to
escape.
If
your
team
has
long-range
crowd
control
such
as
Morgana's
Dark
Binding
,
it
can
sometimes
pay
off
to
put
points
into
Rocket
Grab
to
greatly
increase
the
damage,
as
well
as
a
much-desired
cooldown
decrease.
As
support
you
will
want
to
either
max
Rocket
Grab
or
Overdrive
first.
Rocket
Grab
should
be
maxed
for
shorter
cooldowns
and
higher
damage,
and
Overdrive
should
be
maxed
if
you
need
to
move
faster.
Maxing
Overdrive
first
means
you
can
skip
boots
early,
and
go
for
your
GP/10
items
faster.
Maxing
Power
Fist
on
support
Blitzcrank
is
almost
useless,
since
you
won't
build
AD,
and
it
only
shortens
the
cooldown.
When
playing
support
Blitzcrank
against
a
squishy
bot
laner
or
a
bot
laner
with
low
CC,
you
can
walk
up
to
the
enemy
AD
carry
or
support
instead
of
initiating
with
Rocket
Grab
.
This
can
be
done
by
activating
Overdrive
and
using
Power
Fist
when
you
are
in
range
of
your
target.
Then
when
your
target
tries
to
escape,
use
Rocket
Grab
to
pull
the
target
back
in.
This
is
almost
always
a
secure
kill,
or
at
least
a
force
of
the
enemy's
summoner
spells.
When
you
do
this,
make
sure
your
AD
carry
follows
up.
If
your
AD
carry
doesn't
go
in
with
you,
you
will
most
likely
lose
the
trade
and
maybe
even
die.
Wards
are
a
very
good
early-game
choice
for
Blitzcrank,
allowing
him
to
be
able
to
cast
Rocket
Grab
at
an
enemy
in
a
warded
bush.
Build
usage
Stacking
mana
with
items
like
Manamune
and
Frozen
Heart
will
increase
the
effectiveness
of
his
Mana
Barrier
.
Blitzcrank
can
be
effective
at
tank
,
DPS
,
and
support
roles.
A
tank
should
get
items
that
give
mana
and
survivability,
a
DPS
should
get
Manamune
and
Sheen
(and
later
a
Trinity
Force
,
Iceborn
Gauntlet
),
and
a
support
should
get
cooldown
reduction
to
put
out
as
much
crowd
control
as
possible.
Building
Blitzcrank
as
a
support
consider
getting
Mikael's
Crucible
as
it
will
moderately
boost
your
supporting
capabilities.
Manamune
synergizes
with
Blitzcrank
extremely
well.
It
increases
his
attack
damage,
and
the
potential
1000
mana
increases
the
effectiveness
of
Mana
Barrier
.
This
item
is
universal
in
nearly
every
Blitzcrank
build.
Muramana's
toggle
affects
the
passive
portion
of
Static
Field
-
each
bolt
deals
bonus
damage
and
consumes
mana.
While
increasing
your
DPS
this
can
also
quickly
deplete
your
mana
lowering
the
strength
of
your
Mana
Barrier
.
Alternatively,
Manamune
can
be
replaced
with
Archangel's
Staff
and
on
an
AP/Tank
hybrid
with
other
AP
+
HP
items
such
as
Rod
of
Ages
and
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
.
Sheen
,
and
later
Trinity
Force
can
greatly
increase
the
damage
output
of
Blitzcrank's
standard
combo,
as
well
as
increase
the
strength
of
his
Power
Fist
and
Mana
Barrier
.
Frozen
Heart
and
Banshee's
Veil
are
great
items
for
a
Tanky-Support
Blitzcrank
,
as
they
provide
mana
for
your
Manamune
and
Mana
Barrier
.
This
gives
increased
survivability
(from
the
armor
,
magic
resistance
,
and
synergy
with
Mana
Barrier
),
decent
amounts
of
attack
damage,
and
helpful
cooldown
reduction
.
Since
Blitzcrank
has
trouble
farming
for
gold
,
Aegis
of
the
Legion
can
be
used
as
a
cheap
and
effective
way
to
increase
his
survivability
and
usefulness
to
his
team,
especially
if
he's
being
built
as
a
tanky-support
role.

Countering
Staying
behind
minions
is
a
great
way
to
protect
yourself
against
Blitzcrank's
Rocket
Grab
during
the
laning
phase.
It
is
possible
to
dodge
a
Rocket
Grab
by
moving
perpendicular
to
the
extended
arm
as
it
launches,
causing
it
to
miss
you.
Be
wary
of
Blitzcrank's
location
when
he
is
in
the
bushes.
He
will
more
than
likely
try
to
initiate
with
Rocket
Grab
.
Grabbing
a
ward
for
vision
in
the
brush
counters
this
tactic
well.
When
fighting
a
support
Blitzcrank
,
his
damage
will
be
much
lower
than
his
allied
AD
carry.
Don't
be
afraid
to
force
a
fight
if
he
has
used
Rocket
Grab
and/or
Power
Fist
recently.
Be
careful
not
to
over-commit
when
attacking
Blitzcrank
.
He
will
gain
shield
through
his
Mana
Barrier
when
his
health
gets
low.
This
can
either
result
in
Blitzcrank
managing
to
escape
from
or
kill
you.
The
best
way
to
counter
this
is
to
wait
until
he
drains
his
mana
through
his
spells.
If
you
see
Blitzcrank
has
low
mana,
try
to
go
after
him.
He
only
gains
a
shield
equal
to
50%
of
his
current
mana
.
Some
bottom
picks,
such
as
Ezreal
,
Taric
or
Sivir
effectively
counter
Blitzcrank
by
being
able
to
avoid
or
block
his
Rocket
Grab
or
by
being
tankier
and
harder
hitting
than
he
is;
study
what
champions
counter
and
suffer
against
Blitzcrank
to
better
your
laning
phase.
Save
your
channeled
spells
as
Static
Field
will
briefly
silence
you
and
end
your
channeled
spell.
Beware
of
Blitzcrank
trying
to
bait
you.
Be
sure
you
know
his
Mana
Barrier
is
not
up
before
you
chase
him
down.
Champions
that
can
poke
well
without
putting
themselves
in
much
danger,
such
as
Varus
or
Caitlyn
are
able
to
harass
while
being
considerably
safer
from
Rocket
Grab
than
others.
When
Blitzcrank
goes
for
an
unexpected
grab,
usually
his
allies
are
close
by.
Use
this
to
your
advantage
and
have
teammates
purposefully
get
pulled
and
have
teammates
follow
the
initiate
as
usually
the
enemies
swarm
the
person
getting
grabbed.
