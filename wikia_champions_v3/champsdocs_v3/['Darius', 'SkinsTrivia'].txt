Trivia
Darius
was
designed
by
CertainlyT
.
Darius
was
voiced
by
Chuck
Kourouklis
Darius'
name
derives
from
the
Persian
word
"dariush",
which
means
"kingly".
Darius
was
the
name
of
a
Persian
king
who
was
also
called
"Darius
the
Great".
Darius
is
the
first
champion
to
have
a
special
animation
while
using
Recall
or
Teleport
in
which
he
lifts
his
axe
upward
and
looks
up.
Darius
and
his
brother
Draven
are
the
first
related
champions
to
be
released
back
to
back.
Coincidentally,
they
both
have
the
same
level
of
attack
speed
to
indicate
their
brotherhood.
Darius
is
one
of
the
8
champions
who
do
not
have
a
single
skill
that
scales
off
ability
power;
along
with
Zed
,
Draven
,
Garen
,
Olaf
,
Riven
,
Talon
and
Vayne
.
Quotes
Both
of
Darius'
jokes
have
him
trying
to
spin
while
shouting
"Noxus!"
as
a
reference
to
Garen
and
the
popular
"Spin-To-Win"
joke.
However,
Darius
has
difficulty
performing
the
move
and,
in
one
of
said
jokes,
wonders
how
Garen
does
it.
Darius
shares
a
quote
with
Quinn
.
"Stay
alert."
Skins
In
Darius'
classic
splash
art,
Beatrice
(
Swain's
raven)
appears
in
the
battlefield.
In
Darius'
classic
splash
art,
a
shadowy
figure
can
be
seen
who
resembles
Aatrox
.
Darius'
skin
"
Woad
King
Darius
"
bears
a
striking
resemblance
to
Mel
Gibson
as
William
Wallace
from
Braveheart
.
It
was
formerly
known
as"
Norse
King
Darius
".
He
shares
this
theme
with
Woad
Ashe
.
Darius'
Bioforge
skin
gives
off
a
green
glow
whenever
he
uses
an
ability.
Abilities
When
his
ultimate,
Noxian
Guillotine
,
is
used,
the
model
of
his
classic
skin
will
change
to
be
spattered
with
blood.
Darius'
Noxian
Guillotine
is
referred
to
as
"Sudden
Death"
within
the
game's
files.
Darius'
Crippling
Strike
is
referred
to
as
"Hamstring"
or
"Noxian
Tactics"
in
some
cases
within
the
game's
files.
There
used
to
be
a
buff
icon
when
Darius'
movement
speed
was
increased
through
Hemorrhage
,
with
the
following
text:
"
Aggression
-
The
carnage
of
war
enlivens
Darius,
increasing
his
movement
speed."
Relations
Darius
has
formed
an
alliance
with
Jericho
Swain,
the
Master
Tactician
,
seeing
him
as
a
leader
with
the
mind
and
determination
to
bring
Noxus
to
glory.
With
Swain,
Darius
works
to
unite
the
nation
behind
his
vision
of
true
Noxian
strength.
However,
it
is
unknown
whether
Darius
knows
about
Swain's
past
with
the
Black
Rose
organization.
Darius
is
Draven's
older
brother.
The
two
together
were
known
as
"The
Blood
Brothers".
