Lore
As
a
young
teen,
Lee
Sin
was
intent
on
becoming
a
summoner
.
His
will
and
dedication
were
unmatched
by
any
of
his
peers,
and
his
skill
drew
the
attention
of
Reginald
Ashram,
the
League's
High
Councilor
at
the
time.
While
studying
at
the
Arcanum
Majoris,
Lee
Sin
became
frustrated
with
instruction
paced
for
the
other
students.
He
spent
his
free
time
researching
the
nuances
of
summoning
in
hopes
of
graduating
sooner.
He
made
amazing
advances
in
his
arcane
studies,
surpassing
all
other
students.
By
all
indications,
he
would
have
become
one
of
the
League's
greatest
summoners
were
it
not
for
one
terrible
mistake.
Too
impatient,
he
attempted
to
test
his
ability
by
summoning
a
beast
from
the
Plague
Jungles.
What
he
summoned
instead
was
a
young
boy,
but
not
in
one
piece.
He
barely
had
time
to
look
the
boy
in
what
was
once
his
face
before
the
jumbled
human
mass
fell
lifeless
to
the
floor.
A
League
investigation
later
revealed
that
the
boy's
entire
village
was
obliterated
by
feedback
from
the
ritual.
Lee
Sin's
talents
were
so
promising
that
the
League
was
willing
to
overlook
the
incident,
but
he
could
never
forgive
himself.
He
left
the
Institute
and
journeyed
to
the
Shojin
Monastery
for
eternal
repentance,
swearing
never
to
practice
magic
again.
Years
later,
hoping
to
atone
for
his
crime
with
martyrdom,
he
set
himself
ablaze
as
a
protest
of
the
Noxian
occupation
of
Ionia
.
He
remained
alive
in
this
state,
enduring
searing
agony
for
weeks.
His
actions
paved
the
way
for
a
League
match
wherein
Ionia
prevailed,
but
by
the
time
he
was
doused,
his
eyes
had
been
burned
completely
from
their
sockets.
Hailed
as
a
savior,
he
was
reborn,
and
his
will
to
act
invigorated.
He
joined
the
League
of
Legends
to
continue
his
atonement
with
sweat
and
blood,
a
true
monk's
only
possessions.
"The
actions
of
one
may
sunder
the
world,
but
the
efforts
of
many
may
rebuild
it."
―
Lee
Sin
Protest
of
the
Shojin
Monk
Main
article:
Ionia
The
events
leading
up
to
the
Ionia
vs
Noxus
rematch
started
when
Lee
Sin,
a
monk
from
the
Shojin
Monastery,
set
himself
aflame
within
the
Ionian
Lotus
Garden.
He
would
not
allow
anyone
to
put
out
the
fire
until
the
three
regions
of
Southern
Ionia
were
freed
from
Noxus'
occupation.
[1]
Lee
Sin
remained
in
this
state
of
excruciating
pain
for
over
two
months.
After
Ionia
won
their
rematch
against
Noxus,
he
was
greeted
by
his
sister
from
the
now
liberated
Southern
provinces.
Only
then
did
Lee
Sin
allow
the
flames
to
be
extinguished.
Though
his
brethren
swiftly
brought
the
monk
back
to
the
monastery
for
treatment,
he
had
already
suffered
the
loss
of
his
eyes
due
to
the
intense
heat.

CLE
OBSERVATION
Lee
Sin
crosses
the
Great
Hall
with
an
aura
of
confidence
unusual
for
a
blind
man.
He
seems
to
gather
sensory
information
so
efficiently
it
makes
one
wonder
whether,
for
him,
blindness
is
a
weakness
or
a
strength.
His
physique
is
exceedingly
understated,
tuned
only
for
practical
use
by
years
of
martial
study.
What
he
lacks
in
size,
he
makes
up
for
with
presence.
His
conviction
is
absolute.
He
pads
straight
to
the
doors,
then
stomps
the
ground.
His
head
moves
up
the
door,
tracking
the
resulting
sound.
He
chuckles
at
the
inscription.
REFLECTION
A
damp
echo
trickled
outward
as
the
doors
thud
shut
behind
Lee
Sin,
painting
the
room’s
cramped
dimensions
in
his
mind.
The
sound
was
low
and
the
air
was
stuffy,
distorting
the
noise
and
accenting
his
mental
image
with
a
subtle
blur.
In
the
crannies
of
the
musty
stone,
fading
but
distinct
human
scents
lingered,
the
trace
pheromones
of
violent
emotion.
But
Lee
Sin
was
transfixed
on
the
overwhelming
stench
of
ready
magic.
Arcane
potential
loomed
in
the
air
around
him,
more
than
he
had
ever
sensed
before.
The
Reflecting
Chamber
swelled
with
it.
To
most,
it
would
be
imperceptible,
likely
misinterpreted
as
jitters
or
dread.
It
had
the
quality
of
the
calm
before
the
storm:
a
pregnant
stillness,
a
swindling
serenity.
Lee
Sin
knew
that
this
room,
in
its
current
state,
was
an
amplifier,
an
accelerant
for
sorcery.
He
could
taste
the
magical
anticipation,
like
a
static
charge
waiting
to
be
released.
The
aroma
of
fresh
pine
was
suddenly
everywhere.
He
stepped
back.
And
fire
engulfed
him.
The
sensation
was
familiar
more
than
anything
else.
Before
the
frantic
damage
reports
arrived
from
nerves
all
over
his
body,
he
shut
down
part
of
his
mind.
He
refused
the
pain
access.
Now
there
was
only
intensity
and
focus.
Here
he
was
again,
amidst
the
flames.
In
a
disturbing
way,
it
felt
like
home.
Five
months
had
passed
since
he
began
the
protest
of
the
Noxian
occupation
in
Ionia.
He
lit,
without
any
pretense
of
survival,
the
pyre
that
consumed
his
flesh
for
two
months.
In
that
time,
with
agony
tugging
at
his
sanity,
Lee
Sin
discovered
things
which
hid
deep
within
the
soul,
inner
truths
that
revealed
themselves
only
in
the
face
of
certain
annihilation.
Just
before
the
lapping
flames
were
to
claim
his
final
breath,
his
fellow
monks
arrived
with
the
news
that
Ionia
was
free.
“It
was
a
cleansing
fire,
wasn’t
it?”
He
recognized
the
bold
timbre
of
his
former
mentor,
Reginald
Ashram,
as
acutely
as
the
blaze
surging
around
him.
Ashram
was
one
of
the
few
people
in
Valoran
privy
to
the
secrets
of
Lee
Sin’s
past.
“Pain
does
not
heal
the
heart,
it
only
focuses
the
mind.”
“In
this
case,
it
focused
many
minds,
and
led
to
Noxus’
withdrawal
from
Ionian
territory.”
“A
happy
turn
of
events.”
Lee
Sin
smiled,
although
the
flickering
heat
on
his
face
made
him
wonder
if
Ashram
could
see
it.
“But
you
still
haven’t
forgiven
yourself.”
Lee
Sin
sank
to
a
meditative
pose
and
the
fire
billowed
in
return.
This,
ironically,
was
his
sanctuary.
“The
past
remains,
no
act
will
undo
it.”
His
tongue
knew
these
words
like
the
grooves
of
his
teeth.
“Why
do
you
want
to
join
the
League,
Lee
Sin?”
“I
have
much
yet
to
do.”
“Explain.”
Remaining
seated,
Lee
Sin
raised
one
hand
to
his
chest,
fire
dancing
upon
it.
He
swept
it
forward
so
sharply
that
the
pyre
flickered,
and
the
flames
on
his
arm
were
completely
extinguished.
“A
decisive
strike
may
finish
a
battle,”
He
paused
as
flames
crept
back
up
his
outstretched
arm,
“but
the
evils
of
this
world
persist.
To
combat
them,
we
must
remain
diligent.”
The
fire
reached
his
hand
again,
and
he
closed
it
with
such
force
that
a
shock
wave
rippled
out,
expunging
the
blaze
that
consumed
him.
The
wave
whipped
across
Ashram,
and
he
took
a
half-step
back.
“How
did
you
survive
that
fire?”
“I
found
the
purpose
I
had
lost
so
long
ago.”
“And
what
is
that
purpose?
What
is
your
ultimate
goal?”
There
was
an
urgency
in
Ashram’s
voice,
a
hint
of
concern
that
puzzled
Lee
Sin.
Ashram
felt
threatened.
“One
does
not
need
a
destination
to
have
direction.
Is
a
drop
of
water
finished
when
it
flows
from
the
brook
to
the
ocean?
Is
it
complete
when
it
rises
to
join
the
clouds?
Has
it
failed
when
it
falls
upon
the
land?”
An
obliging
drop
of
sweat
rolled
down
his
forehead.
“What
is
your
direction?”
“To
do
what
is
right.
To
protect
the
overlooked
things
which
matter
most.”
The
drop
of
sweat
hovered
on
the
edge
of
his
brow.
“You
can
find
them
in
the
bubbling
of
the
brook,
the
shade
of
the
passing
cloud,
or
the
coolness
of
the
rain.”
On
cue,
the
drop
fell
to
his
waiting
palm.
Ashram
phrased
his
response
carefully.
“Your
protest
moved
all
of
Valoran
to
action.
Nearly
to
military
action.
This
is
a
tremendous
amount
of
power
for
one
man
to
wield.
What
happens
if
that
one
man’s
intentions
become
corrupt?”
“Then
I
hope
other
men
find
the
good
in
themselves
to
do
what
is
right.”
The
inquisitor
reeked
of
frustration.
He
was
unused
to
vulnerability,
uncomfortable
with
all
that
Lee
Sin
could
perceive.
“How
does
it
feel
to
expose
your
mind?”
The
question
was
bitter
and
hollow,
deprived
of
its
usual
gravitas.
“I
would
ask
you
the
same
question.”
Silence
ensued.
Lee
Sin
knew
he
was
alone.
The
magical
potency
was
gone,
spent,
and
in
its
place
sat
an
atmosphere
of
somber
fatigue.
This
was
the
emotional
residue
of
those
who
had
completed
the
trial
before
him.
Its
flavor
was
bittersweet.
In
one
graceful,
fluid
motion,
Lee
Sin
was
on
his
feet.
His
clothes
and
skin
were
intact,
as
though
untouched
by
the
flames.
A
fresh
breeze
swept
through
the
room.
Lee
Sin
could
sense
the
shape
of
its
current
as
it
moved,
like
a
serpent
returning
to
coil
in
its
nest.
Lee
Sin
lingered
a
moment,
head
bowed
in
appreciation
of
the
champions
who
had
passed
this
threshold
before
him.
One
life
past,
one
life
ahead.
So
the
Blind
Monk
joined
the
League
of
Legends.

revealed
Blind
Monk's
true
name:
Lee
Sin
[4]
Blind
Monk's
model
was
used
in
WCG
for
the
spectator.
His
height
is
similar
to
that
of
Jax
,
basing
upon
his
concept
art.
It
was
said
that
he
was
remade
into
Udyr
The
Animal
Spirit
.
However,
Riot
Game
Designer
Guinsoo
hinted
that
this
was
not
the
case.
[3]
Hohums
later
confirmed
Guinsoo's
words.
[5]
It
has
been
strongly
implied
that
he
was
the
burning
monk
during
the
Ionia/Noxus
feud,
in
Issue
12
of
the
JoJ
,
stating
"His
brethren
hastened
the
monk’s
blistered
body
swiftly
back
to
the
monastery
for
treatment.
While
it
was
clear
that
he
would
survive,
the
monk
had
suffered
the
loss
of
his
eyes
,
along
with
other
severe
injuries
from
the
intense
heat."
These
would
seem
to
corroborate
the
"Mystic
Meditation"
icon,
as
well
as
the
fact
that
flickers
of
flame
can
be
seen
in
its
portrait.
This
was
later
confirmed
in
his
League
Judgment,
and
Champion
Background.

In

which
could
mean
that
artwork

being

for
Lee
Sin,
that
the
Rioters
are
trying
to
tease
the
Blind-Monk
fanboys,
or
that
the
artist
in
question
just
likes
working
on
Blind

for
fun.

"Brolaf,

the
name
"Blind

can
be
seen

This

Promo
Last
year,
around
this
time,
we
were
forced
to
say
our
goodbyes
to
a
loved
and
cherished
friend,
taken
from
us
so
tragically
and
so
senselessly
before
his
time.
On
April
1st
2010,
we
bid
farewell
to
Urf
the
Manatee.
It
was
a
trying
time
for
all
of
us
all,
and
many
came
forward
to
pour
their
hearts
out
and
memorialize
this
noble
prince
among
Sea
Cows.
If
there’s
anything
that
the
death
of
Urf
the
Manatee
has
taught
us,
it’s
that
people
deal
with
grief
in
different
ways.
For
instance,
take
this
gentleman
here.
Lee
Sin
was
so
shaken
up
that
he
actually
ran
off
and
joined
a
monastery.
Now
he’s
Lee

the
Blind
Monk.
Hey,
what
do

mean

seen
him
before?

was
