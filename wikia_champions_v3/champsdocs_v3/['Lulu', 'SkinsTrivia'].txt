Trivia
Lulu
was
designed
by
Xypherous
.
[2]
Lulu
is
the
first
champion
to
be
announced
directly
through
an
Art
Spotlight
.
Lulu
is
the
first
champion
to
be
available
for
play
on
the
Public
Beta
Environment
before
her
official
release.
Lulu
is
the
first
champion
to
have
a
champion-specific
login
theme.
Lulu
is
voiced
by
Faye
Mata.
Lulu
is
the
first
champion
to
utilize
polymorph
.
[2]
During
her
development,
Riot
designers
commonly
referred
to
Lulu
as
the
"Suppordle".
While
Lulu's
main
skin
is
a
whimsical
fantasy
piece,
her
alternate
release
skins
are
both
references
to
recent
trends
in
Dark
Fantasy
,
adding
disturbing
imagery
to
her
lighthearted
kit.
Casting
Help,
Pix!
on
an
enemy
will
place
a
debuff
on
the
target
and
the
tooltip
reads
"Hey!
Listen!"
at
the
end
of
it.
This
is
a
reference
to
Navi
from
The
Legend
of
Zelda:
Ocarina
of
Time
.
Lulu
grabs
her
hat
and
flies
on
her
staff
when
she
casts
Whimsy
on
herself.
Lulu
can
be
a
possible
reference
to
Schierke
,
a
young
witch-in-training
that
is
accompanied
by
a
little
elf
from
Berserk.
Lulu
used
to
be
called
Waena
while
in
production.
[3]
Lulu's
abilities
when
used
on
allies
or
enemies
is
aptly
named
x's
Assistance/"Assistance".
Victims
of
Lulu's
magic
also
has
a
flavor
text
below
it.
Quotes
Lulu's
movement
quote
"Yup,
that
tasted
purple."
is
likely
a
reference
to
Philip
Fry's
quote
from
the
episode
"The
Why
of
Fry"
("Did
everything
just
taste
purple
for
a
second?")
from
the
sitcom
Futurama
.
In
the
Polish
client,
Lulu
quote,
"Po
oczach
ich,
Pix,
po
oczach!"
(Go
for
the
eyes,
Pix,
for
the
eyes!)
is
a
reference
to
Baldur's
Gate
2
character
Minsc
who
says
the
same
thing
to
his
hamster.
Skins
Dragon
Trainer
Lulu
is
most
likely
a
reference
to
the
movie
How
to
Train
Your
Dragon
.
This
skin
turns
Pix
into
a
small
dragon
with
design
reminiscent
of
dragon
designs
in
How
to
Train
Your
Dragon
movie.
The
small
dragon
that
replaces
Pix
bears
a
resemblance
to
Spyro
the
Dragon.
Bittersweet
Lulu
is
a
possible
reference
to
the
German
story
of
Hänsel
and
Gretel
.
It
is
the
only
skin
in
which
Lulu's
ears
are
not
visible.
It
is
also
the
only
skin
where
her
eyes
are
heterochromatic
.
Whimsy
turns
her
enemies
into
a
cupcake.
Winter
Wonder
Lulu
is
based
in
an
idea
of
CelestialBird
(=Cirath)

Relations

to
the
new
beta
site
for
League
of
