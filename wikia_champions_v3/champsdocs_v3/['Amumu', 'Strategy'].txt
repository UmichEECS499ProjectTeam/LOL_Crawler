Trivia
Skill
usage
Cursed
Touch
reduces
magic
resistance
by
up
to
25.
When
going
for
the
kill,
make
sure
you
get
in
at
least
one
melee
attack,
as
many
champions
only
have
30
base
magic
resistance.
Refrain
from
spamming
your
skills
early
game,
as
it
can
lead
to
mana
starvation.
Maxing
Bandage
Toss
last
allows
you
to
stack
up
damage
with
your
other
abilities
early
game.
The
length
of
the
stun
is
the
same
at
all
levels
of
the
skill.
Bandage
Toss
can
also
be
used
through
walls
on
neutral
camps
as
an
escape
mechanism.
The
Ancient
Golem
buff
allows
Amumu
,
due
to
its
mana
regeneration
,
to
keep
Despair
activated
almost
indefinitely.
Despair
is
very
effective
against
other
tanks,
so
make
sure
you're
in
range
of
the
opponent's
highest
health
champions.
Despair
has
a
0.01
(1%)
scaling.
In
game
the
tooltip
only
shows
despair
doing
more
%
health
damage
per
every
100
ability
power
.
For
example
500
AP
=
5%
health
every
second
+
2.7%
base
and
24
additional
MD
at
level
5.
Tantrum's
passive
makes
Amumu
a
very
hardy
jungler.
Amumu
is
a
great
jungler
with
Despair
and
Tantrum
allowing
for
an
easy
and
strong
jungle.
Amumu's
pre-level
6
ganks
are
fairly
strong,
provided
the
lane
is
pushed.
A
pushed
lane,
teammates
with
closers
and
good
damage
or
teammates
with
2
or
more
Crowd
Control
abilities
can
often
result
in
a
kill,
even
against
enemies
with
Flash.
The
key
is
to
hit
Bandage
Toss
successfully
for
the
stun,
and
pre-level
6,
you
will
often
only
have
1
chance
to
do
so.
Bandaging
from
a
bush
straight
to
a
target
looks
flashy,
but
often,
teammates
will
not
be
able
to
fully
maximize
the
damage
they
deal
due
to
reaction
time
needed
for
your
move.
It
can
also
be
difficult
to
hit
since
enemies
sometimes
move
in
an
unpredictable
manner.
A
surer
way
of
hitting
Bandage
Toss
is
to
walk
towards
the
enemy
from
the
opposite
direction
of
your
teammates,
preferably
after
your
teammates
have
engaged
the
enemy,
which
places
the
enemy
within
striking
range
for
your
teammates.
Bandage
Toss
is
not
cast
until
Amumu
is
chasing
the
enemy
unless
the
enemy
and
Amumu's
teammates
are
still
engaged
in
battle
by
the
time
they
are
within
range.
When
Amumu
is
directly
behind
a
fleeing
enemy,
it
is
easier
to
predict
their
path.
Amumu's
Curse
of
the
Sad
Mummy
,
is
crucial
in
team
fights
and
can
often
be
the
deciding
factor.
You
should
try
to
have
it
ready
for
when
a
team
fight
breaks
out.
Always
try
to
use
Curse
of
the
Sad
Mummy
on
as
many
enemies
as
possible
while
your
team
is
in
the
vicinity.
Amumu's
Curse
of
the
Sad
Mummy
is
very
effective
when
combined
with
many
other
champions'
ultimates,
particularly
area
of
effect
spells,
such
as
Glacial
Storm
,
Bullet
Time
,
Absolute
Zero
,
Crowstorm
and
Soul
Shackles
.
Try
to
coordinate
abilities
like
these
to
rack
up
heavy
damage
at
the
start
of
a
team
fight.
Amumu's
Curse
of
the
Sad
Mummy
can
be
blocked
by
Morgana's
Black
Shield
and
other
crowd
control
-preventing
items/abilities.
Keep
in
mind
that
Curse
of
the
Sad
Mummy
does
not
stop
enemy
channeled
abilities
such
as
Katarina's
Death
Lotus
or
Nunu's
Absolute
Zero
.
If
you
are
running
away
from
an
enemy,
you
can
Bandage
Toss
over
a
wall
to
a
neutral
minion
camp
to
pull
yourself
over
the
wall.
It's
not
advised
to
do
this
if
you
cannot
survive
the
aggro
from
the
minions.
Using
Bandage
Toss
slightly
before
being
knocked
back
by
abilities
will
first
kick
Amumu
back
and
then
pull
him
to
the
target
hit.
It
is
possible
to
use
Tantrum
to
proxy
with
Amumu
.
Build
usage
Amumu
can
be
built
as
a
pure
tank
with
health
and
situational
magic
resistance
and/or
armor
defensive
items.
Health
items
that
also
give
ability
power
are
strong
for
this
build,
such
as
Rod
of
Ages
or
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
.
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
grants
Amumu's
abilities
a
movement
speed
slow,
although
at
a
reduced
percentage
because
his
two
primary
damage
abilities
are
AoE
.
Despair
will
permanently
slow
nearby
enemies
as
long
as
you
have
mana
to
cast
it.
A
Spirit
Stone
provides
consistent
health
and
mana
regeneration,
building
out
of
Hunter's
Machete
.
This
can
then
be
built
into
a
Spirit
of
the
Ancient
Golem
or
Spirit
of
the
Spectral
Wraith
.
Magic
Resistance
Reduction
is
a
very
useful
stat
on
Amumu
as
it
helps
him
and
his
team
to
deal
with
magic
resistance
tanks
.
Abyssal
Scepter
is
a
very
good
item
on
Amumu
,
as
it
synergizes
with
Cursed
Touch
,
increases
the
effective
damage
of
Despair
(and
Sunfire
Cape
),
and
helps
in
team
fights.
Sunfire
Cape
can
be
effective
against
all
physical
damage
teams
and
tends
to
synergize
nicely
with
his
other
AoE
abilities,
especially
Despair
.
Abyssal
Scepter
's
MR
Reduction
also
has
the
same
range
as
Curse
of
the
Sad
Mummy
,
meaning
that
chaining
it
and
other
AoE
Ultimates
such
as
Mega
Inferno
Bomb
results
in
increased
damage
output.
Cooldown
reduction
on
Amumu
is
very
strong,
but
it's
often
difficult
to
itemize
for
it.
Grab
the
Crest
of
the
Ancient
Golem
buff
when
possible
(when
mid
cannot/does
not
need
to
take
it)
to
gain
cooldown
reduction
without
sacrificing
stats.
Frozen
Heart
and
Randuin's
Omen
are
two
great
items
to
purchase
-
the
former's
mana
and
cooldown
reduction
works
especially
well
on
Amumu
,
while
the
slows
of
the
latter
helps
Amumu
keep
the
enemy
close
to
him
and
wear
them
down
with
Despair
and
Tantrum
.
Consider
whether
or
not
the
Randuin's
Omen
attack
speed
slow
is
worth
the
cooldown
Tantrum
receives
upon
being
autoattacked.
Some
form
of
mana
or
mana
regeneration
is
advised
for
Amumu
as
his
Despair
and
Curse
of
the
Sad
Mummy
can
quickly
deplete
his
mana
pool
early
in
the
game.
An
AP
focused
build
can
work
well
as
Tear
of
the
Goddess
charge
quickly
with
his
despair,
then
later
in
game,
shield
from
Seraph's
Embrace
will
show
useful
for
teamfights
,
Chalice
of
Harmony
is
also
a
good
choice
in
early,
and
can
later
be
upgraded
to
Athene's
Unholy
Grail
to
increase
his
damages
and
get
the
very
useful
Cooldown
reduction
.
A
Hextech
Revolver
can
give
Amumu
more
sustain
in
the
jungle
as
sustain
is
a
significant
problem
for
most
magic
damage
junglers.
However,
most
of
Amumu's
spells
are
AoE
dmg,
which
makes
it
less
effective.

Countering
Keep
your
team
spread
out
while
engaging
Amumu
to
avoid
his
strong
area
of
effect
damage
and
disruptive
effect
of
his
Curse
of
the
Sad
Mummy
.
Attempt
to
disengage
from
Amumu
as
cleanly
as
possible
after
he
uses
Curse
of
the
Sad
Mummy
,
heal
up,
and
attack
his
team
again.
It
is
a
major
source
of
his
power,
and
if
it
doesn't
lead
to
a
large
victory
for
his
team
that
the
enemy
can't
recover
from
while
it
is
cooling
down,
Amumu
,
and
his
team,
are
much
more
vulnerable.
Use
your
minions
as
a
shield
against
initiation
with
Bandage
Toss
,
but
be
aware
that
if
he
grabs
a
minion
near
you
he
can
still
initiate
on
you
with
his
Curse
of
the
Sad
Mummy
.
While
Amumu
has
very
good
sustained
damage,
it
requires
him
to
be
fairly
close
to
the
enemy
and
he
has
no
inherent
methods
to
stick
onto
enemies.
After
he
uses
his
Bandage
Toss
,
he
can
be
kited.
Favor
magic
resistance
over
stacking
health
to
mitigate
damage
from
Despair
and
Cursed
Touch
.
Amumu
lacks
an
innate
ability
to
heal
himself
and
is
most
vulnerable
to
harassment
as
he
cannot
sustain
himself.
Having
Banshee's
Veil
is
an
effective
way
to
prevent
from
getting
snared
from
Curse
of
the
Sad
Mummy
.
Another
cheaper
choice
would
be
Quicksilver
Sash
.
If
Amumu
is
jungling
,
pick
up
Sight
Ward
s
in
your
lane
to
help
prevent
a
potentially
deadly
fight.
If
you
don't
have
wards,
another
great
hint
that
he's
ganking
is
if
the
opposing
team
in
your
lane
suddenly
turns
aggressive,
especially
in
a
situation
that
would
put
them
in
a
bad
position.
Amumu
is
a
champion
that
especially
synergizes
well
with
teammates
-
as
a
result,
he
is
fairly
weak
alone,
and
he
is
fairly
lacking
in
the
regard
of
escaping.
Many
popular
junglers
are
easily
able
to
beat
Amumu
in
a
one-on-one
fight
-
gain
control
of
the
river
and
jungle
with
wards
can
allow
your
jungler
to
locate
and
kill
him.
