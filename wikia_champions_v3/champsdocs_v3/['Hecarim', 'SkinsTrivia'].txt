Trivia
Hecarim
was
designed
by
FeralPony
.
[1]
Hecarim
is
voiced
by
Scott
McNeil
.
Hecarim
is
an
anagram
for
"Chimera".
Hecarim
is
possibly
inspired
by
the
Four
Horsemen
of
the
Apocalypse
,
particularly
the
rider
symbolizing
War.
(The
other
horsemen
theme
champions
to
have
been
released
so
far
are
Karthus
,
Morderkaiser
and
Thresh
.)
Hecarim
may
also
be
inspired
by
the
Assault
Rider
from
the
Kingdom
Hearts
games.
They
share
a
very
similar
body
shape,
concept
and
moveset.
Hecarim's
dance
is
a
reference
to
the
viral
Youtube
video
"Dope
Zebra"
by
rhettandlink.
A
side-by-side
comparison
can
be
seen
here
.
It
is
possible
for
Hecarim
to
get
attack
damage
of
over
1,000
with
a
combination
of
certain
items,
summoner
spells,
and
ally
buffs.
Warpath
is
the
first
(and
for
now
only)
ability
that
scales
with
movement
speed.
Quotes
Hecarim's
joke,
"Suffering
is
magic,"
is
a
reference
to
the
TV
show,
My
Little
Pony:
Friendship
is
Magic
,
created
by
Lauren
Faust
.
Hecarim's
second
joke,
"Another
blue
ribbon
for
Hecarim,"
is
a
reference
to
the
blue
ribbon
,
a
term
used
to
describe
something
of
high
quality.
They
are
often
granted
as
an
award
to
the
winner
of
a
contest
showcasing
horses
or
other
livestock.
Hecarim
shares
a
quote
with
Battlecast
Prime
Cho'Gath,
"Crush
them
underfoot."
Skins
Blood
Knight
Hecarim's
skin
resembles
and
has
the
same
name
as
Vampire
Counts
Blood
Knights
From
the
Warhammer
Universe
.
Hecarim
is
the
last
champion
from
season
two
to
get
2
skins
upon
release.
Headless
Hecarim
is
based
off
of
the
folk
legend
The
Headless
Horseman.
The
chinese
classic
splash
art
for
Hecarim
uses
the
pose
on
his
concept
art,
with
the
only
difference
being
the
spear's
blade
overturned.
Arcade
Hecarim
is
a
reference
to
many
'80s
and
early
'90s
fantasy
and
video
game
effects.
Hecarim
shares
the
Arcade
theme
with
Sona
.
This
skin
is
clearly
a
tribute
to
the
popular
Adult
Swim
mini-game
called
'Robot
Unicorn
Attack'
.
The
green,
red/pink,
yellow,
blue,
and
orange
buttons
near
the
bottom
of
his
spear
(used
during
his
back
animations)
seem
to
be
based
on
the
Video
Game
Guitar
Hero
.
The
South
American
version
of
"Arcade
Hecarim"
skin
was
wrongly
translated
as
"Hecarim
of
Arcadia"
(
"Hecarim
de
Arcadia"
).
Arcades
in
Spanish
are
either
called
"Arcades"
or
"Fichines",
so
it
doesn't
make
sense
in
Spanish
either.
It
may
be
a
nonsensical
reference
to
"Lawrence
of
Arabia"
("Lawrance
de
Arabia").
Relationship
Hecarim
and
Mordekaiser
appear
to
know
each
other.
They
have
similar
beliefs,
but
apprently
do
not
agree
on
the
methods
each
uses
to
achieve
their
goals.
On
the
Twisted
Treeline
,
the
western
Altar
warns
Hecarim
that
Mordekaiser
is
not
to
be
trusted.
Despite
this,
however,
the
two
are
still
listed
as
friends
rather
than
rivals
on
the
official
League
of
Legends
website.
