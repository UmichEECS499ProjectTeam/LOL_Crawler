Background

&
Trivia
Skill
Usage
Warpath
benefits
from
all
movement
speed
bonuses,
including
those
provided
by
boots
(
Movement
speed
1
provides
+25,
2
is
+45,
3
is
+60,
5
is
+105),
Ghost
(+27%,
35%
with
Summoner's
Wrath
),
Homeguard
,
Revive
(+25%
only
with
Summoner's
Resolve
)
and
Devastating
Charge
(up
to
+75%).
Devastating
Charge
deals
more
damage
based
on
the
distance
traveled.
Try
using
Onslaught
of
Shadows
or
summoner
spells
such
as
Ghost
or
Flash
to
maximize
this
damage.
There
are
also
Nimble
and
Wanderer
masteries
and
Swiftness
runes
HOWEVER
,
raw
movement
speed
in
the
range
of
415â€“490
suffers
an
80%
multiplier,
and
raw
movement
speed
beyond
490
suffers
a
50%
multiplier.
See
Movement
speed
for
further
information.
Therefore,
it
is
probably
better
to
simply
build
AD
instead
of
getting
movement
speed
buffs,
simply
for
the
better
AD
per
gold
ratio(s).
As
a
rule
of
thumb,
having
at
least
one
movement
speed
item
would
be
very
efficient,
two
is
optional
and
any
above
is
considered
cost
inefficient.
Hecarim
can
cast
Rampage
while
moving,
making
it
good
for
harassing
melee
champions,
chasing
enemies,
and
hit-and-run
tactics.
Be
sure
to
use
Rampage
at
least
once
before
ending
Devastating
Charge
,
since
the
bonus
movement
speed
gives
you
more
damage.
Spirit
of
Dread
restores
health
when
nearby
enemies
take
damage,
including
damage
dealt
by
allies.
Cast
this
during
a
large
fight
to
maximize
Hecarim's
survivability.
When
jungling
as
Hecarim,
be
sure
to
use
Smite
while
Spirit
of
Dread
is
active,
to
gain
a
small
burst
of
healing.
Slow
effects
significantly
reduce
Hecarim's
damage
output
if
you
build
him
with
high
movement
speed.
Cleanse
and
tenacity
help
to
combat
this.
Devastating
Charge
applies
on-hit
effects
and
also
damages
turrets,
try
to
combine
it
with
Sheen
or
Trinity
Force
to
maximize
its
damage.
Be
sure
to
activate
Devastating
Charge
just
before
using
Onslaught
of
Shadows
whenever
possible:
Devastating
Charge
gains
bonus
damage
from
the
distance
traveled
during
Onslaught
of
Shadows
.
Hecarim
can
use
Devastating
Charge's
knockback
immediately
after
the
forced
flee
from
Onslaught
of
Shadows
to
knock
an
enemy
even
closer
to
or
farther
away
from
his
team.
Onslaught
of
Shadows
can
be
used
for
avoiding
many
on-hit
disable,
like
Ashe's
Enchanted
Crystal
Arrow
,
with
the
right
timing.
In
team
fights,
try
to
use
Spirit
of
Dread
when
your
teamates
uses
their
high-
damage
abilities
on
enemy
champions.
In
this
case,
Hecarim
can
be
almost
unkillable
in
the
4
second
duration.
Note
that
the
trick
cannot
be
applied
on
team
pushes
as
the
healing
is
capped
against
minions
.
Build
Usage
Because
Hecarim
is
weak
against
high
sustained
damage,
consider
a
Warden's
Mail
against
sustained
autoattack
damage
or
a
Negatron
Cloak
against
sustained
magic
damage.
While
defensive
boots
may
be
necessary
for
Hecarim
in
most
games,
being
a
melee
AD
character,
in
games
where
Hecarim
can
afford
to
build
more
offensively,
his
Warpath
passive
makes
Boots
of
Swiftness
an
offensive
alternative
to
Berserker's
Greaves
or
Ionian
Boots
of
Lucidity
.
Boots
of
Mobility
has
more
limited
usefulness
because
Hecarim
can
use
Devastating
Charge
to
effectively
traverse
the
map
without
them
and
entering
combat
nullifies
their
bonus
movement
speed;
however,
they
can
still
provide
an
extra
burst
of
damage
on
your
first
attack.
Boots
of
Swiftness
can
be
all
the
speed
increase
Hecarim
needs
to
nearly
maximize
Warpath
by
increasing
his
base
speed
from
345
to
405,
10
points
under
the
first
soft
cap.
They
also
reduce
the
effectiveness
of
slows
and
allow
for
a
more
versatile
itemization.
A
single
Greater
Quintessence
of
Movement
Speed
can
be
used
to
bring
it
to
411
movement
speed,
without
using
masteries.
Homeguard
is
very
useful
for
Hecarim
when
defending
the
base
because
he
can
give
a
surprise
to
his
opponent
by
activating
Devastating
Charge
at
the
spawning
pool
and
dash
to
the
pushing
enemies.
If
you
can
time
your
Rampage
just
before
the
enhanced
autoattack
,
you
can
deal
a
high
burst
of
damage
even
when
you
build
a
few
offensive
items
because
Warpath
converts
your
bonus
movement
speed
into
bonus
AD
.
Your
AD
can
reach
over
350
by
the
method
shown
above
in
a
short
time.
Youmuu's
Ghostblade
synergizes
with
Warpath
and
Hecarim's
burst
damage
tendencies
in
general.
The
Black
Cleaver
provides
many
useful
stats
for
Hecarim
:
health
,
attack
damage
,
cooldown
reduction
and
armor
penetration
.
Additionally,
The
Black
Cleaver
's
passive
synergizes
well
with
Hecarim
's
Rampage
.
With
its
short
cooldown,
it
allows
Hecarim
to
apply
the
armor
reduction
stacks
in
quick
succession.
Despite
the
virtues
of
building
bonus
movement
speed
on
Hecarim
,
it
isn't
necessary
to
stack
movement
speed
on
him.
Even
with
only
a
couple
bonus
movement
speed
items,
Hecarim
can
get
a
large
Warpath
bonus
from
runes
,
masteries
,
Ghost
,
and
support
champions
with
haste
abilities
such
as
Time
Warp
or
anyone
holding
Shurelya's
Reverie
.
Spirit
of
Dread
heals
Hecarim
based
off
of
all
damage
dealt
to
enemies
from
any
source.
Spirit
Visage
boosts
this
healing.
It
is
also
a
very
useful
item
for
Hecarim
in
general,
granting
magic
resist
,
health
,
health
regen
/5
seconds,
and
cooldown
reduction
,
all
of
which
are
useful
for
Hecarim
's
common
role
as
a
tank.
Since
Spirit
of
Dread
returns
health
off
of
ANY
damage
done
to
enemies
while
it
is
active,
Sunfire
Cape
makes
a
better-than-usual
item,
essentially
granting
up
to
a
bonus
52.5
health
regen
/5
seconds
for
each
nearby
enemy
champion
(with
enemy
minion
health
drained
being
capped)
for
4
seconds,
in
addition
to
the
bonus
armor
and
health
.
Sheen
and
Iceborn
Gauntlet
synergize
particularly
well
with
Rampage
,
as
its
low
cooldown
allows
you
to
proc
the
bonus
damage
and
slow
approximately
every
other
autoattack.
Alternately,
and
especially
since
the
rework
to
Phage
,
Trinity
Force
can
be
a
useful
offensive
item
for
Hecarim
.
The
bonus
movement
speed
from
Zeal
helps
his
roaming
and
gives
bonus
damage
due
to
Warpath
,
and
Phage
grants
bonus
movement
speed
on-hit,
improving
his
already
potent
chasing
ability.
However,
unlike
Iceborn
Gauntlet
,
it
does
not
provide
armor
,
cooldown
reduction
,
or
the
slow,
all
of
which
are
very
useful
for
Hecarim
.
Frozen
Heart
is
an
excellent
mid
game
item
for
Hecarim,
as
all
the
stats
it
provides
are
greatly
beneficial
to
him,
making
it
very
cost
effective.
Getting
an
early
Glacial
Shroud
is
a
common
build
path
on
Hecarim.
This
is
particularly
useful
if
you
are
building
Trinity
Force
instead
of
Iceborn
Gauntlet
,
as
Frozen
Heart
fills
in
the
cooldown
reduction
,
mana
,
and
armor
you
would
be
missing
from
the
Gauntlet.

Countering
Hecarim
is
a
powerful
AoE
threat,
especially
in
the
later
stages
of
the
game.
Try
to
prevent
him
from
itemizing.
In
addition,
spreading
out
will
reduce
his
effectiveness
by
preventing
him
from
terrifying
your
team
with
Onslaught
of
Shadows
,
mitigating
the
constant
AoE
damage
Hecarim
can
deal
with
Rampage
,
and
decreasing
the
amount
of
sustain
he
can
gain
from
Spirit
of
Dread
.
Spirit
of
Dread
grants
Hecarim
very
high
sustainability,
but
has
a
fairly
lengthy
cooldown
and
a
short
duration.
Consider
using
burst
damage
or
waiting
for
Spirit
of
Dread
to
time
out
before
targeting
him.
Hecarim
may
attempt
to
land
behind
you
with
Onslaught
of
Shadows
and/or
Devastating
Charge
to
push
you
towards
the
rest
of
his
team.
Try
to
Flash
away
or
position
yourself
so
that
this
is
not
a
possibility.
Powerful
slows
,
such
as
Wither
,
Mega
Adhesive
,
Electro-Harpoon
or
Glitterlance
can
completely
nullify
the
damage
bonus
from
Warpath
and
prevent
Hecarim
from
engaging
with
Devastating
Charge
.
Hecarim
is
exceptionally
weak
at
dueling
against
most
champions
early
game,
so
he
is
susceptible
to
early
invades
from
the
opposing
jungler.
He
is
also
incredibly
reliant
on
Crest
of
the
Ancient
Golem
,
which
can
especially
hinder
his
clear
times
should
he
lose
the
buff.
