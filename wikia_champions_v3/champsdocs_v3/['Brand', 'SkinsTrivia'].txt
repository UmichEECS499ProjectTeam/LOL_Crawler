Trivia
Brand
was
designed
by
Coronach
.
Brand
is
the
Danish,
Dutch,
German
and
Swedish
word
for
"blaze/fire",
"burning"
and
"burned".
Brand
is
the
second
champion
to
be
based
around
a
fire
theme,
the
first
being
Annie
.
Brand's
ability,
Sear
has
a
similar
in-game
animation
to
Annie's
auto-attack.
Brand's
auto-attacks
also
have
the
same
particle
as
Morgana's
auto-attacks,
though
changed
in
color
from
purple
to
orange.
Considering
Lokfar's
similarities
to
stereotypical
vikings
and
Norsemen
of
the
past
(
Olaf
),
Brand
may
have
been
inspired
by
the
fire
giant
Surtr
of
Norse
mythology.
His
appearance
follows
a
common
description
of
the
character
(blackened
skin
with
lava
crackling
underneath),
and
Brand
claims
he
is
destined
to
renew
the
world
by
burning
it,
which
is
Surtr's
role
in
Ragnarök.
Brand
could
also
have
been
inspired
by
Ignus
of
Planescape:
Torment
,
due
to
both
of
them
being
mages
basked
in
flames,
burning
their
enemies,
and
having
lost
their
humanity
to
become
what
they
are
now.
Pyroclasm
might
be
a
reference
to
Vaan's
Quickening
of
the
same
name
in
Final
Fantasy
XII
,
or
the
Magic
the
Gathering
Card
made
in
2001
with
the
same
name,
but
could
also
be
referring
to
the
word
pyroclastic
(derived
from
the
Greek:
πῦρ,
meaning
fire;
and
κλαστός,
meaning
broken),
which
is
used
to
describe
fast
moving
volcanic
material.
The
body
that
Brand
is
currently
occupying
once
belonged
to
Kegan
Rodhe,
a
seafaring
marauder.
This
concept
of
possession
may
be
in
reference
to
human
branding
,
a
process
in
which
a
mark
is
seared
into
the
skin
of
a
living
person,
with
the
intention
that
the
resulting
scar
will
make
the
mark
permanent.
This
was
used
as
a
method
to
impose
ownership
over
an
oppressed
person.
Quotes
Brand's
line
"
Some
say
the
world
will
end
in
fire.
"
might
be
a
reference
to
the
poem
Fire
and
Ice
by
Robert
Frost
but
most
likely
referring
to
an
archaic
but
well
known
concept
of
the
end
of
the
world,
namely
Ragnarok
of
Norse
mythology,
in
which
the
earth
is
set
on
fire.
Brand's
joke
"
Is
it
hot
in
here
or
is
it
just
me?
"
was
once
used
by
Anivia
before
her
current
voice.
Zombie
Brand's
line
"
Every
day
I'm
shambling.
"
is
a
reference
to
LMFAO
Party
rock
anthem
quote
"
Every
day
I'm
shuffling
".
It
might
also
be
a
reference
to
Rick
Ross'
song
"Everyday
I'm
Hustling"
Zombie
Brand's
line
"Not
easy
being
green...and
dead"
Is
a
reference
to
the
song
"
Bein'
Green
"
sung
by
Kermit
the
Frog
on
The
Muppet
Show
.
Zombie
Brand
shares
a
quote
"Dead
man
walking."
with
Graves
.
Skins
The
original
name
of
the
Vandal
Brand
skin
was
Biker
Brand
as
seen
in
his
art
spotlight.
An
icon
of
Gragas
can
be
seen
on
the
Keg
Tap
Handle
behind
the
bar
in
Brand's
Vandal
artwork,
along
with
the
words
"Graggy
Ice"
scratched
into
the
cask.
Vandal
Brand
shares
many
similarities
with
the
Marvel
Comics
character
Ghost
Rider
,
most
notably
the
wrapped
chains,
the
leather
jacket
with
spikes,
and
the
original
name
'Biker
Brand',
which
would
imply
he
rode
motorcycles.
Cryocore
Brand
strongly
resembles
Mr.
Freeze
from
the
Batman
franchise
.
This
skin
changes
Brand's
particles
to
a
blue
color,
representing
ice
in
place
of
his
normal
fire.
Zombie
Brand
is
his
1st
legendary
skin.
It
changes
his
particles
to
a
greener
hue
and
changes
his
animations
and
voice
to
that
of
a
more
traditional
zombie.
Zombie
Brand's
appearance
is
based
off
the
normal
zombie
from
the
Plants
vs.
Zombies
video
game.
Zombie
Brand's
suit
is
also
the
same
as
the
regular
zombie
from
Plants
vs.
Zombies.
Zombie
Brand's
dance
is
from
Michael
Jackson's
"Thriller".
Zombie
Ryze
also
shares
this
theme.
Aside
from
Pulsefire
Ezreal
,
Zombie
Brand
and
Haunted
Maokai
are
the
first
skins
that
have
respawn
animation
when
their
champion
did
not
have
one.
Relationships
Brand
was
captured
by
a
summoner
,
with
the
aid
of
Garen
and
Lux
.
With
the
revelation
that
Lokfar
is
in
Freljord
,
it
is
speculated
that
Brand's
icy
imprisonment
many
centuries
ago
was
at
the
hands
of
The
Ice
Witch
.
This
is
supported
by
the
fact
that
Lissandra
has
a
particular
taunt
for
him.
