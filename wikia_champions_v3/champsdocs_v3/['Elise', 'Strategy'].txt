&
Trivia
Skill
Usage
Spider
Form
is
most
effective
at
finishing
off
enemies
with
low
health;
Human
Form's
Neurotoxin
does
more
damage
to
healthy
foes.
Because
of
this,
using
Neurotoxin
,
followed
by
Volatile
Spiderling
and
then
switching
forms
to
use
Skittering
Frenzy
to
deal
some
more
damage
and
finally,
Venomous
Bite
is
very
effective.
Spider
Form
abilities
do
not
cost
mana
and
can
be
prioritized
when
you
are
trying
to
conserve
mana.
Use
Spider
Form
when
escaping,
as
being
in
this
form
grants
you
10
bonus
movement
speed,
your
spiderlings
will
trail
behind
and
possibly
block
skillshots,
and
you
can
use
this
form's
Venomous
Bite
and
Rappel
to
gap
close
away
to
enemy
minions
or
neutral
monsters.
Venomous
Bite
will
still
cause
you
to
dash
to
the
target
if
it
dies
during
the
cast
time,
but
the
spell
will
not
go
on
cooldown.
Venomous
Bite
will
cause
Elise's
spiderlings
to
leap
to
the
target.
Volatile
Spiderling
will
also
leap
to
the
target
of
Venomous
Bite
if
the
created
spiderling
is
near
the
target.
A
neat
trick
with
Volatile
Spiderling
during
the
laning
phase
is
to
aim
the
skill
towards
your
turret
or
away
from
the
enemy
minions,
followed
up
by
a
quick
Venomous
Bite
to
an
enemy
champion.
The
created
spiderling
will
jump
to
your
target,
ensuring
the
skill
to
hit.
Use
Spider
Form
to
get
back
to
lane
faster,
as
it
gives
bonus
movement
speed.
Rappel
can
not
see
stealthed
champions,
however
it
can
see
those
in
brush
,
when
suspended
in
the
air.
Rappel
can
be
used
to
get
over
terrain,
as
long
as
Elise
can
Rappel
to
a
target.
Example:
Use
Rappel
behind
Ancient
Golem's
wall
to
grant
vision
and
cast
again
to
descend
on
it.
This
can
be
greatly
used
to
steal
neutral
minions
and
objectives
such
as
Baron
Nashor
or
Dragon
if
positioned
correctly.
Rappel
used
at
the
right
moment
can
dodge
projectiles
and
delayed
AoE
spells
like
Enchanted
Crystal
Arrow
,
Trueshot
Barrage
,
Requiem
,
Absolute
Zero
,
Time
Bomb
,
Dark
Matter
,
Explosive
Cask
and
Ace
in
the
Hole
.
Rappel
does
not
cancel
leash
spells
such
as
Drain
,
Soul
Shackles
,
or
Decrepify
.
Elise
is
a
deceptively
effective
pusher
&
counter
jungler
due
to
her
spiderlings.
Use
Spider
Form
to
take
enemy
jungle
camps,
towers,
and
other
structures
when
the
opportunity
presents
itself.
Item
Usage
Elise
has
fairly
low
AP
scaling
but
good
base
damage.
So
it's
often
better
to
focus
on
cooldown
reduction
for
better
damage,
or
tankiness
so
you
can
stay
in
combat
longer.
Due
to
her
Q
in
both
forms
dealing
percentage-based
damage,
Magic
penetration
is
almost
certainly
the
most
important
offensive
stat
to
build
with
Elise,
making
Sorcerer's
Shoes
,
Liandry's
Torment
,
Abyssal
Scepter
and,
late-game,
a
Void
Staff
core
items
in
any
offensive
Elise
build.
On-hit
build
(
Nashor's
Tooth
and/or
Wit's
End
)
also
works
very
well
as
her
spider
form
grants
bonus
magic
damage,
and
her
Skittering
Frenzy
is
a
very
large
attack
speed
boost.
However
doing
this
makes
her
human
form
less
effective.
Lich
Bane
is
an
effective
item
for
Elise
,
as
it
grants
some
damage
after
every
spell.
Zhonya's
Hourglass
is
another
defensive
item
which
gives
you
more
damage.
Also
its
active
ability
can
save
you
in
difficult
situations,
synergizing
well
with
the
short
time
of
disappearance
from
your
Rappel
.
The
spiderlings
aren't
affected
by
the
active,
so
they
can
inflict
some
extra
damage
during
the
stasis.
Due
to
how
spammable
her
abilities
can
be
late
game,
building
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
on
her
would
allow
you
to
constantly
slow
your
enemies
especially
in
human
form
and
increase
your
chances
of
survivability.
This
synergies
very
well
with
Liandry's
Torment
.
If
you
find
yourself
constantly
running
low
on
health,
try
to
equip
a
Spirit
Visage
and
an
item
that
provides
spell
vamp
(
i.e.
Hextech
Gunblade
,
Spirit
of
the
Spectral
Wraith
)
as
this
will
increase
the
health
you
regain
from
Skittering
Frenzy
.

Countering
Elise's
Spider
Form
is
more
dangerous
when
you
are
at
low
health
and
her
Human
Form
more
potent
when
you
are
at
high
health.
Rappel
will
only
move
Elise
straight
up
and
down
unless
she
can
descend
upon
an
enemy
unit
(including
minions
and
neutral
monsters).
Rappel
has
a
long
cooldown
and
she
is
vulnerable
after
she
has
used
it.
Rappel
can
be
cancelled
if
you
use
hard
crowd
control
on
her
(such
as
for
example
the
knock-up
from
Jarvan
IV's
Dragon
Strike
)
while
she's
on
her
rising
animation,
and
it
will
cause
her
to
immediately
descend
upon
rising.
When
you
are
targeted
by
Elise's
Rappel
,
she
can
be
lured
into
turret
range
or
other
dangerous
areas
by
moving
there
when
she
starts
to
go
up,
as
she
cannot
cancel
the
ability
once
cast.
A
quick
Flash
or
dash
ability
is
the
most
effective
way
to
do
this.
