Details
Frozen
Tomb
is
an
enemy
or
self
targeted
point
blank
area
of
effect
ability.
Applies
spell
effects
as
an
area
of
effect
ability.
Spell
vamp
is
reduced
to
one-third
effectiveness.
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
will
apply
a
15%
slow.
Magic
damage
will
be
mitigated
by
Black
Shield
and
Lifeline
.
Spell
shields
will
block
the
stun
and
both
the
initial
damage
and
the
radiating
ice
damage
but
do
not
block
the
slow.
Additional
Information:
Once
cast
the
ice
will
expand
from
the
main
target,
creating
an
slow
field.
When
an
enemy
comes
in
contact
for
the
first
time
with
the
ice
they
will
be
damaged
and
a
small
visual
and
sound
effect
will
be
produced.
This
can
only
happen
once
per
cast.
If
a
champion
has
a
spell
shield
the
first
they
touch
the
ice
it
will
be
popped
and
they
will
become
immune
to
any
damage
from
that
cast
It
takes
about
1
second
for
the
slow
field
to
fully
form
There
is
a
~0.4
seconds
delay
before
the
main
target
(
if
it's
an
enemy)
is
stunned
and
damaged.
If
a
champion
becomes
untargetable
in
that
delay
it
will
be
able
to
avoid
the
damage
and
stun.
The
ice
field
will
be
formed
anyways.
If
a
champion
blinks
or
dashes
away
in
the
moment
Lissandra
casts
Frozen
Tombo
on
them
they
will
arrive
to
their
destination
damaged
and
stunned,
but
the
slow
field
will
form
in
their
original
location
This
causes
a
significant
visual
error,
as
the
main
glacier
will
travel
with
the
target
while
the
slow
field
remains
in
place
If
she
casts
it
on
herself
Lissandra
will
be
invulnerable
AND
untargetable.
This
mean
she
can
not
be
killed
or
damaged
by
any
posible
means
during
Frozen
Tomb,
not
even
by
the
Nexus
Obelisk
or
damage
over
time
