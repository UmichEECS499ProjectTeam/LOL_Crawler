Trivia
LeBlanc
was
one
of
the
champions
chosen
for
the
Noxian
pool
available
during
the
2010
Ionian
Versus
Noxus
Grudge
Match
.
She
was
not
one
of
the
selected
champions,
however.
LeBlanc
was
designed
by
Coronach
.
Her
name
might
be
a
reference
to
a
Final
Fantasy
X-2
character
with
the
same
name.
In
the
beginning
of
the
game,
she
uses
illusions
to
trick
others
as
well.
LeBlanc's
name
in
French
literally
means
"The
White".
It
could
be
a
reference
to
the
French
mathematician
Sophie
Germain
,
who
used
the
name
M.
LeBlanc
to
attend
a
university
despite
women
in
her
times
not
being
allowed
to
do
so.
The
reflecton
in
her
old
classic
artwork
is
slightly
different,
possibly
showing
her
old/true
self,
Evaine.
Prior
to
patch
3.9,
LeBlanc's
Mimic
was
the
only
ability
in
game
that
cost
mana
at
rank
one,
but
completely
lost
the
cost
upon
reaching
max
rank.
Now,
Lucian's
Relentless
Pursuit
is
the
only
ability
that
has
that
mechanic.
Quotes
Her
joke:
"For
my
next
trick,
I'll
make
their
life
bar
disappear."
is
a
reference
to
the
common
stage
magician
routine
where
the
performer
will
make
their
assistant
or
some
large
object
"vanish"
in
front
of
an
audience.
It
could
also
be
connected
to
the
false
leak
of
her
abilities,
where
her
ultimate
made
her
team's
life
bar
disappear
for
the
enemy
team.
LeBlanc's
lines
"Classic
misdirection."
and
"Lying
is,
like,
ninety-five
percent
of
what
I
do."
are
likely
references
to
the
TV
series
Archer
.
LeBlanc's
line
"Surprised
to
see
me?"
is
likely
a
reference
to
the
similar
line
spoken
by
Agent
Smith
from
The
Matrix
Reloaded
.
Her
"For
my
next
trick,
I'll
make
their
life
bar
disappear."
quote
is
similar
to
Shaco
's
joke:
"For
my
next
trick
,
I'll
make
you
disappear.".
Leblanc
and
Shaco's
joke
is
similar
to
a
phrase
said
by
Kefka
from
Final
Fantasy
VI
at
min
3.25
Skins
Classic
LeBlanc's
old
artwork
may
be
influenced
by
the
Queen
from
The
Brothers
Grimm
fairy
tale
and
Disney
movie
Snow
White
,
due
to
the
magic
mirror
in
the
background.
LeBlanc
is
the
first
champion
whose
loading
image
and
in-game
icon
do
not
represent
the
champion.
In
this
instance,
it
focuses
upon
her
clone.
Wicked
LeBlanc
is
a
reference
to
Cruella
de
Vil
from
Disney
movie
101
Dalmatians
,
based
on
the
famous
British
children's
book.
Prestigious
LeBlanc
is
a
reference
to
magicians
in
general.
Prestigious
being
a
common
"title",
and
the
Prestige
being
the
final
and
grandest
part
of
a
magician's
act.
The
skin
looks
similar
to
Zatanna
Zatara
from
New
Earth.
Relations
LeBlanc's
real
name
is
Evaine.
She
no
longer
refers
to
herself
by
this
name
after
taking
on
the
mantle
of
Emilia
LeBlanc,
the
Matron
of
the
Black
Rose
society.
LeBlanc
is
in
an
alliance
with
Swain
,
a
former
member
of
the
Black
Rose.
LeBlanc,
speculatively,
may
be
the
witch
that
killed
Vayne's
parents.
There
is
a
speculation
that
LeBlanc
and
the
Black
Rose
organization
are
being
secretly
investigated
by
Vayne
.
Another
speculation
is
that
LeBlanc
had
impersonated
Jarvan
IV
in
the
fight
over
Kalamanda
:
in
official
artwork
from
the
Journal
of
Justice
,
LeBlanc's
reflection
can
be
seen
where
Jarvan's
should
have
been
in
Swain's
breastplate.
