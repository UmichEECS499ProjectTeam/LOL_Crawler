Trivia
Nautilus
was
designed
by
Xypherous
.
[1]
In
Greek,
the
term
"Nautilus"
means
"Sailor."
A
Nautilus
is
a
marine
species
of
the
cephalopod,
Nautilidae
family,
and
is
related
to
squid
species.
Nautilus
is
also
the
name
of
the
fictional
submarine
from
the
book
Twenty
Thousand
Leagues
Under
the
Sea
.
It
is
also
the
name
of
the
first
nuclear
powered
submarine,
the
USS
Nautilus
(SSN-571)
.
Nautilus
bears
a
resemblance
to
the
Big
Daddy
from
the
BioShock
series,
as
they
both
have
classic
diving
suits.
Additionally,
in
Nautilus'
Champion
Spotlight,
he
was
presenting
his
skills
on
Annie
,
who
bears
a
resemblance
to
the
Little
Sisters
that
are
protected
by
the
Big
Daddies.
He
also
bears
a
resemblance
to
the
Barrelchest
robot
from
RuneScape
,
which
also
wields
a
anchor.
In
the
lore,
the
black
water
responsible
for
turning
Nautilus
into
his
current
state
is
a
possible
reference
to
the
cartoon,
The
Pirates
of
Dark
Water
.
Nautilus'
dance
reference
is
clearly
seen
as
the
Peeparoonie
Dance
.
A
side-by-side
comparison
can
be
seen
here
.
In
Nautilus'
Art
Spotlight,
around
2:50,
a
tab
saying
Urgot
Mech
can
be
seen
in
the
top
left.
This
was
likely
the
development
name
for
Battlecast
Urgot
.
Nautilus
has
one
of
the
longest
attack
animations
of
any
champion.
This
can
lead
to
odd
and
unexpected
hits,
as
the
enemy
finds
themself
stunned
or
damaged,
even
though
they
are
visually
beyond
his
range.
It
is
sometimes
unclear
at
what
point
in
the
animation
an
attack
is
considered
to
have
hit.
Nautilus
was
released
without
the
"Tank"
tag,
but
it
was
confirmed
that
the
absence
of
the
tag
was
an
error
which
would
be
fixed.
Nautilus
is
indeed
primarily
a
tank.
When
Nautilus
stands
idle
long
enough,
he
does
the
famous
Captain
Morgan
pose.
Skins
Abyssal
Nautilus
bears
a
strong
resemblance
to
the
Chaos
Space
Marines
of
the
Black
Legion
from
the
Warhammer
40,000
franchise,
both
featuring
a
black
and
yellow
color
scheme.
It
is
primarily
inspired
by
Jules
Verne's
classic
novel,
Twenty
Thousand
Leagues
Under
the
Sea
.
In
the
skin's
splash
art,
there
is
a
small
statue
in
the
bottom
left
corner
with
a
Cthulhu-like
appearance.
Astro
Nautilus
was
a
community
requested
skin,
inspired
by
MaTTcomGO's
artwork
.
The
skin's
splash
art
features
Astronaut
Teemo
in
the
background.
Coincidentally,
the
skin
was
released
in
the
Public
Beta
Environment
2
days
after
the
death
of
Neil
Armstrong
,
the
first
man
to
walk
on
the
moon.
Subterranean
Nautilus'
Chinese
splash
art
has
Black
Rock
Shooter
sitting
on
one
of
the
rocks.
