Nami
Champion
Background
Strategy
Skins
&
Trivia
Skill
Usage
Nami
has
very
high
potential
in
ganking.
Her
passive
Surging
Tides
gives
bonus
movement
speed
for
1.5
seconds,
which
is
enough
for
a
teammate
to
catch
up
to
an
opposing
enemy.
Tidal
Wave
should
be
used
immediately
in
large
team
fights
to
gain
an
advantage.
It
can
also
be
used
to
catch
up
to
retreating
enemies.
When
Tidal
Wave
passes
through
ally
champions,
it
grants
Nami's
innate
ability
Surging
Tides
.
Aqua
Prison
can
be
cast
on
an
ally
just
to
apply
Nami's
innate
ablility
Surging
Tides
.
If
you
need
a
quick
escape
from
a
melee
champion
who
is
already
autoattacking
you,
try
casting
Aqua
Prison
right
on
yourself,
as
it
will
be
extremely
hard
to
dodge
and
will
also
apply
Surging
Tides
to
speed
your
escape
while
the
enemy
is
stunned.
Tidal
Wave
and
Aqua
Prison
can
interrupt
channeling
spells,
like
Death
Lotus
,
Requiem
and
Absolute
Zero
.
Ebb
and
Flow
is
great
for
casting
in
a
2v2
fight
in
bot
lane.
It
damages
your
enemies,
heals
an
ally
and
activates
your
passive
Surging
Tides
,
which
will
provide
a
significant
advantage.
Ebb
and
Flow
bounces
between
allied
and
enemy
champions
and
doesn't
hit
the
same
target
twice,
depending
on
which
side
you
cast
the
ability
on.
If
cast
on
an
allied
champion,
the
spell
will
hit
as
follows:
ally
→
enemy
→
ally
.
If
cast
on
an
enemy
champion,
the
spell
will
hit
as
follows:
enemy
→
ally
→
enemy
.
If
there
is
no
appropriate
unit
for
the
middle
bounce
effect,
such
as
if
no
enemy
unit
is
around
in
an
ally
→
enemy
→
ally
bounce,
only
the
initial
cast
will
occur.
This
ability
can
deal
a
lot
of
damage
if
quickly
combined
with
Aqua
Prison
and
followed
by
Tidal
Wave
,
this
burst
is
somewhat
near
to
that
of
a
mage
character
and
can
kill
fragile
opponents
if
you
have
a
lot
of
AP
The
bounce
range
of
Ebb
and
Flow
is
larger
than
the
cast
range,
so
sometimes
casting
Ebb
and
Flow
on
yourselves
can
achieve
longer
range
than
casting
Ebb
and
Flow
straight
on
enemy.
Tidecaller's
Blessing
works
great
with
skillshot
champions
like
Corki
and
Ezreal
,
because
of
their
great
poking
potential
and
how
they
rely
on
spamming
basic
attacks
between
skillshots.
It's
also
extremely
effective
on
champions
with
powerful
auto-attack
modifiers
such
as
Draven
or
Kog'Maw
to
create
powerful
harassment
which
is
more
difficult
to
escape
from.
Nami
is
a
squishy
champion,
so
be
careful
not
to
let
yourself
get
caught
alone.
Positioning
is
always
important.
Care
should
be
taken
when
utilizing
and
choosing
targets
for
Nami's
abilities:
Aqua
Prison
Offensively,
should
be
cast
on
squishy
targets,
like
an
AD
carry
or
a
support,
unless
they
have
high
mobility
or
can
easily
dodge
it
(like
Ezreal
or
Vayne
).
In
these
cases,
you
should
instead
aim
at
a
target
with
a
lower
chance
of
dodging
it.
Defensively,
it's
(more
reliably)
useful
to
peel
for
your
carries
after
they've
been
jumped
at
by
someone
with
a
gapcloser,
like
Pantheon
or
Vi
,
or
interrupt
a
channeled
ability
like
Katarina's
Death
Lotus
or
Varus's
Piercing
Arrow
.
When
prioritizing
healing,
Ebb
and
Flow
should
be
cast
on
allies:
this
will
potentially
heal
two
allies
or
yourself
as
well.
On
the
other
hand,
when
harassing,
prioritizing
enemies
may
result
in
two
enemies
taking
damage
while
healing
one
ally
or
yourself.
Tidecaller's
Blessing
damage
increases
with
your
AP,
not
the
allied
champion
you
cast
it
onto.
Unlike
most
other
attack
steroids,
there
is
no
need
to
choose
a
high
damage
or
attack
speed
target.
As
long
as
your
target
attacks
three
times
in
six
seconds,
you
get
the
full
effect
of
the
skill.
A
slower
attack
speed
target
may
even
be
able
to
apply
the
slow
longer.
It
will,
however,
benefit
from
the
allied
champion's
magic
penetration.
It
will
also
work
with
champions
that
are
using
on-hit
builds
like
Teemo
and
with
abilities
that
apply
on-hit
effects
like
Gangplank's
Parrrley
.
Tidecaller's
Blessing
synergizes
well
with
Fizz's
Seastone
Trident
when
used
in
conjunction
with
the
Spellsword
mastery,
giving
your
ally
great
magic
damage
output
on
his
basic
attacks.
If
you
see
that
your
teammate
needs
to
escape
or
is
chasing
an
enemy
down,
you
can
use
either
your
Ebb
and
Flow
or
Tidecaller's
Blessing
to
quickly
activate
your
passive,
Surging
Tides
increasing
your
allies
movement
speed.
Casting
Tidecaller's
Blessing
is
usually
the
better
option
than
Ebb
and
Flow
because
it
consumes
less
mana
and
is
instant
cast.
Ebb
and
Flow
may
heal
you
or
your
allies,
but
it
requires
a
very
short
channeling
time,
which
could
allow
your
chaser
to
catch
up.
Build
Usage
Nami's
abilities
require
a
high
amount
of
mana;
buying
mana
regen
or
flat
mana-giving
items
will
allow
you
to
stay
in
lane
longer
to
support
your
allies.
If
played
as
support
Nami
has
many
viable
builds;
choose
items
that
suit
her
lane
partner
and/or
counter
the
opposing
duo.
If
you're
aiming
for
mana,
try
buying
items
that
grant
plenty
of
mana,
such
as
Archangel's
Staff
and
Frozen
Heart
.
If
combined,
these
items
can
give
you
some
decent
survivability
and
AP
.
If
your
aim
is
for
mana
regen,
try
Athene's
Unholy
Grail
or
Morellonomicon
.
Another
option
is
Mikael's
Crucible
,
a
more
support-oriented
item
that
could
replace
Athene's
Unholy
Grail
;
the
downside
is
that
Mikael's
Crucible
doesn't
provide
cooldown
reduction.
All
of
Nami's
abilities
have
long
cooldowns,
and
they
hardly
reduce
by
levelling,
so
items
that
grant
CDR
like
Morellonomicon
and
Athene's
Unholy
Grail
will
definitely
help
you.
Ionian
Boots
of
Lucidity
may
be
your
first
choice
of
boots
if
you're
a
support;
however,
the
previous
three
mentioned
items
will
give
you
max
cooldown
reduction,
so
these
boots
would
be
useless.
Trying
other
boots,
such
as
Boots
of
Swiftness
or
Sorcerer's
Shoes
,
should
be
equally
as
beneficial
in
case
you
wanted
to
move
around
faster
to
keep
in
position,
or
pack
more
damage
into
your
spells.
If
you
are
being
focused
by
the
enemy
team
because
you
are
a
good
support
then
a
Zhonya's
Hourglass
/
Wooglet's
Witchcap
might
be
a
viable
choice.
Hextech
Revolver
is
a
relatively
cheap
item,
it
can
provide
some
more
healing
sustain,
and
it
can
later
be
built
into
Will
of
the
Ancients
.
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
is
a
great
item
if
you
want
to
maximilize
your
slow
effectiveness
on
your
offensive
skills.
Both
Ebb
and
Flow
and
Tidal
Wave
can
benefit
from
this
very
well,
since
first
skill
can
bounce
to
enemies
and
apply
full
slow
and
your
ultimate
can
apply
additional
slow.
Beside
that
you
will
gain
additional
HP
that
can
stack
effectively
with
your
Sightstone,
and
portion
of
AP
for
even
more
damage
with
your
Tidecaller's
Blessing
.

Countering
Like
all
squishy
champions,
Nami
can
be
countered
and
easily
targeted
by
assassin
champions
with
stealth
like:
Evelynn
,
Shaco
and
Teemo
and
champions
with
gap
closers
like
Fiora
,
Jax
and
Xin
Zhao
.
Aqua
Prison
and
Tidal
Wave
are
both
fairly
easy
to
sidestep,
but
be
careful
when
you
are
fighting
in
the
jungle
or
being
chased,
as
this
limits
where
you
can
go
in
order
to
dodge
both
abilities.
Use
any
item
that
grants
Tenacity.
It
will
render
most
of
her
crowd
control
useless.
