Lore
Since
his
first
sighting
on
the
northwestern
shores
of
Valoran
,
the
towering,
armored
specter
known
as
Hecarim
struck
a
chilling
fear
into
the
hearts
of
all
who
laid
eyes
upon
him.
No
one
had
ever
seen
anything
like
his
titanic,
ethereal
form
before,
and
the
mystery
of
his
sudden
arrival
was
deeply
unnerving.
When
Hecarim
began
to
march
eastwards,
leaving
a
trail
of
desolate,
lifeless
ground
behind
him,
the
villagers
of
the
plains
fled
their
homes
for
the
safety
of
nearby
Demacia
.
In
the
city's
now-overcrowded
taverns,
rumors
about
this
inhuman
phantom
spread
in
hushed
whispers.
Some
claimed
that
he
was
the
vengeful
shade
of
an
ancient
warrior,
intent
on
destroying
all
living
beings;
one
man
insisted
that
they
had
seen
him
leading
an
entire
legion
of
spectral
cavalrymen;
others
still
believed
him
to
be
the
creation
of
some
hateful
necromancer.
One
Demacian
commander,
seeking
to
dispel
the
terror
that
had
gripped
the
city,
assembled
a
few
of
his
finest
soldiers
and
rode
out
to
turn
back
or
destroy
Hecarim.
The
commander
led
his
soldiers
to
stand
in
Hecarim's
path
and
braced
for
his
assault.
As
the
apparition
bore
down
on
them,
an
overwhelming
sensation
of
dread
gripped
the
warriors.
The
men,
frozen
in
fear,
could
only
scream
as
the
ghostly
titan
ran
them
down,
tearing
them
apart
and
trampling
them
beneath
his
iron
hooves.
Hecarim
turned
to
the
crippled,
cowering
commander
and
uttered
a
chilling
statement:
"This
is
merely
the
beginning.
No
mortal
army
can
withstand
the
might
of
the
Shadow
Isles
."
With
that,
Hecarim
departed,
resuming
his
grim
march.
Driven
to
insanity
by
his
nightmarish
experience,
the
commander
stumbled
back
to
Demacia,
where
his
dire
warnings
were
dismissed
as
the
ravings
of
a
madman.
While
Hecarim's
origin
and
intent
were
still
a
mystery,
his
destination
became
clear
when
he
reached
the
Institute
of
War
and,
in
a
voice
both
ominous
and
commanding,
demanded
entry
into
the
League
of
Legends
.
"You
don't
understand...
the
shadows
will
consume
us
all..."
―
Former
Demacian

Announcement

"We
here
at
Riot
Games
make
every
effort
to
ensure
that
our
stable
of
champions
is
as
diverse
as
possible.
Still,
even
after
the
addition
of
Sejuani
to
the
League
of
Legends,
there
are
those
cavalry
enthusiasts
out
there
who
would
contend
that
the
greatest
warriors
ride
horses.
For
you
purists,
we'd
like
to
propose
an
alternative
point
of
view.
It
is
our
opinion
that
the
most
epic
warriors
are
themselves
at
least
50%
equine.
And
as
evidence
of
this
theory
it
is
our
pleasure
to
present
Hecarim,
the
Shadow
of
War.
So
if
you
enjoy
leveling
your
lance
and
charging
headlong
into
the
brunt
of
the
enemy
ranks
leaving
only
the
trampled
corpses
of
lesser
foes
in
your
wake,
we're
pretty
sure
that
Hecarim,
the
Shadow
of
War
will
have
you
chomping
at
the
bit
come
next
patch!"
