Lore
Many
men
have
gone
mad
beneath
the
glare
of
the
Shurima
sun,
but
it
was
during
the
night's
chilling
embrace
that
Malzahar
relinquished
his
sanity.
Malzahar
was
born
a
Seer,
blessed
with
the
gift
of
foresight.
His
talent,
though
unrefined,
promised
to
be
one
of
Runeterra's
greatest
boons,
but
destiny
plotted
him
another
course;
his
sensitivity
to
the
roiling
tides
of
fate
allowed
other,
unwelcome
things
to
tug
at
his
subconscious
mind.
In
his
dreams,
where
the
veil
of
separation
is
thinnest,
a
sinister
thing
beckoned.
For
some
time,
Malzahar
was
able
to
resist
its
prodding,
but
with
each
passing
night
the
voice
grew
louder,
or
perhaps
deeper,
until
he
could
withstand
the
call
no
more.
He
ventured
into
the
desert
without
supplies,
drawn
by
the
lure
of
a
specious
charm.
His
destination:
a
lost
civilization
to
the
east,
known
to
ancient
texts
as
Icathia
.
Few
believed
such
a
place
ever
existed,
and
those
who
did
were
certain
that
the
sands
had
long
since
devoured
whatever
remained.
When
Malzahar's
cracked
feet
finally
failed
him,
he
found
himself
kneeling
at
the
base
of
a
bizarre
crumbling
obelisk.
Beyond
it
lain
the
alien
geometry
of
a
ruined
city
and
the
giant
decaying
idols
of
dark
and
horrific
gods.
His
eyes,
seeing
what
others
cannot,
and
what
none
should,
were
filled
with
the
essence
of
the
Void
.
His
once
shifting
visions
of
the
future
were
replaced
with
the
immutable
promise
of
Valoran
beset
by
creatures
of
the
Void.
Standing
alone,
but
not
alone,
amidst
the
echoing
dunes,
he
noticed
the
familiar
voice
escape
his
own
lips
in
a
parched
rasp,
bearing
three
words
whose
weight
trembled
his
knees:
League
of
Legends
.
Now
infused
with
the
power
of
the
void
itself,
Malzahar
set
off
to
the
north
to
seek
his
fate.
"The
land
may
melt,
the
sea
may
swell,
the
sky
may
fall...
but
they
will
come!"

Malzahar

Sneak
Peek
Announcement
made
in
the
sneak
peek
by
ByronicHero:
Summoners!
This
is
a
public
service
announcement
regarding
a
shady
looking
fellow
that
may
have
made
his
way
onto
the
Field
of
Justice.
If
you
see
a
shrouded,
floating
man
with
a
generally
poor
disposition,
exercise
caution…
particularly
if
you
see
any
dark,
sinister
portals
or
hideous
creatures
of
the
void
milling
about.
This
may
be
none
other
than
Malzahar,
Prophet
of
the
Void,
and
he's
probably
not
the
type
of
bloke
you
want
to
run
into
on
your
way
back
to
your
stool
from
the
men's
room.
On
the
other
hand,
if
you
like
dark
matter,
bottomless
pits,
exoskeletal
monsters,
menacing
sacrificial
daggers,
or
moving
without
touching
the
ground,
you
may
want
to
take
a
moment
to
let
this
gentleman
know
that
you're
a
fan
of
his
work.
Look
for
Malzahar
in
the
upcoming
patch!
