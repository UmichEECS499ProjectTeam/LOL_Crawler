Jinx
lives
to
wreak
havoc
without
a
thought
for
consequence,
leaving
a
trail
of
mayhem
and
panic
in
her
wake.
A
manic
and
impulsive
criminal,
she
despises
nothing
more
than
boredom,
and
gleefully
unleashes
her
own
volatile
brand
of
pandemonium
to
the
one
place
she
finds
dullest:
Piltover
.
With
an
arsenal
of
deadly
toys,
she
unleashes
the
brightest
explosions
and
loudest
blasts
-
all
the
better
to
shock
and
surprise
the
hapless
authorities.
Always
just
out
of
the
law's
reach,
Jinx's
favorite
game
is
to
toy
with
Piltover's
finest
-
especially
Vi
.
Piltover
had
long
been
known
as
the
City
of
Progress,
a
place
where
peace
and
order
reigned.
That
serenity
was
challenged
when
a
new
kind
of
criminal
arrived,
the
likes
of
whom
had
never
been
seen.
This
mysterious
outlaw
unleashed
a
series
of
warped
and
destructive
capers
that
endangered
the
entire
city,
and
left
its
people
reeling
from
the
worst
crime
spree
in
Piltover's
history.
As
the
string
of
crimes
without
rhyme
or
reason
hit
the
city,
sightings
of
the
lawbreaker
emerged.
Though
the
young
woman's
origins
were
a
mystery,
some
saw
traces
of
Piltover
hextech
in
her
firearms,
while
others
described
the
street
fashions
of
Zaun
in
her
dress.
Because
her
arrival
always
brought
trouble
with
it,
those
who
crossed
her
path
soon
gave
her
a
name:
Jinx.
Jinx's
rampage
escalated.
Caitlyn
-
the
sheriff
of
Piltover
-
responded
by
declaring
a
state
of
emergency
and
organizing
a
city-wide
manhunt.
In
typical
Jinx
fashion,
the
criminal
marked
the
Piltover
treasury,
the
city's
most
secure
building,
with
a
direct
challenge
to
its
most
abrasive
officer.
With
a
caricature
of
Vi's
face
splashed
across
the
treasury's
facade,
and
with
a
time
and
date
of
her
supposed
raid,
Jinx
was
openly
daring
the
enforcer
to
stop
her
from
robbing
it.
Determined
to
put
the
troublemaker
behind
bars,
Vi
watched
and
waited
outside
the
treasury
until
Jinx's
time
had
finally
come.
True
to
her
scrawled
promise,
the
smiling
menace
showed
her
face.
Knowing
this
was
her
chance
to
capture
the
outlaw,
Vi
gave
chase
into
the
building's
interior.
She
smashed
through
wall
after
wall
to
chase
down
Jinx,
who
giggled
as
she
lit
up
the
evacuated
treasury
with
fiery
explosions.
Vi
finally
cornered
the
criminal
inside
the
vault,
but
Jinx
wasn't
done
just
yet.
With
a
maniacal
laugh,
she
fired
a
barrage
of
rockets,
bringing
the
entire
building
down
upon
them
both.
When
Vi
finally
crawled
out
of
the
ruins,
the
battered
enforcer
found
no
trace
of
Jinx.
Adding
insult
to
injury,
not
a
single
ounce
of
gold
had
been
taken
from
the
ruined
vault.
Instead,
the
criminal
left
a
parting
message
to
her
favorite
officer
of
the
law
-
a
challenge
only
now
visible
through
the
gaping
opening
in
Piltover's
skyline.
The
lights
of
the
city
spelled
out
a
simple
taunt:
you'll
never
catch
me.
As
Vi
read
the
message,
she
heard
the
distant
laughter
of
her
new
nemesis,
and
the
city
plunged
into
utter
darkness
for
the
very
first
time.
Oh
look
-
I'm
opening
my
box
of
care!
Oh
wait
-
it's
empty!

Mayhem
everywhere

The
name’s
Vi.
I’m
an
enforcer.
And
this
is
my
town
-
Piltover
.
They
call
this
place
the
City
of
Progress
-
or
they
did
until
she
showed
up.
Her
name
is
Jinx.
That’s
what
they
call
her,
anyway.
No
one
knows
who
she
is,
or
where
she
came
from.
This
scrawny
pain
in
the
neck
shows
up
one
day,
firing
heavy
guns
in
the
air.
And
laughing
–
always
with
the
laugh.
I
can’t
stand
her.
Everything
changed
the
day
she
arrived
in
town.
They
might
as
well
call
it
the
City
of
Crime.
Panic
among
the
people.
Chaos
in
the
streets.
Mayhem
everywhere
you
look.
The
worst
part
is:
none
of
it
makes
any
sense.
Ask
her
why
she’s
doing
it,
and
she’ll
give
you
a
million
different
reasons.
But
the
only
one
that
matters
is:
She’s
having
fun.
Piltover
is
just
a
plaything
to
her.
She’s
enjoying
the
time
of
her
life,
and
she
doesn’t
care
who
gets
hurt.
Well,
I’m
here
to
shut
down
the
party.
It
doesn’t
matter
what
she
wants.
I
don’t
care
what
her
sob
story
is.
I’m
gonna
put
her
away
for
a
long,
long
time.
And
right
before
I
do,
I
promise
you:
I’m
gonna
wipe
that
stupid
grin
off
her
face.
Permanently.

While
Jinx
finishes
loading
Pow-Pow
and
Fishbones
for
her
debut
on
the
battlefield,
we
wanted
to
share
one
more
glimpse
into
her
chaotic
personality.
For
Jinx,
the
fun
doesn't
end
just
because
she's
sleeping.
Featuring
hexplosive
sequences
packed
with
bombs
and
bullets
and
her
unique
take
on
fun,
League

Get
Jinxed
frees
the
Loose
Cannon
to
serve
up
wild
hijinks
without
those
pesky
Piltover
laws
getting
in
the
way.
Whether
through
cinematics,
motion
comics,
log-in
screens
or
music,
we're
continuing
to
explore
new
ways
to
deliver
champion
stories.
Showcasing
a
new
song
inspired
by
a
hedonistic
supercriminal
and
her
vivid
imagination
running
wild?
Time
for
a
music
video.
As
always,
we
can't
wait
to
hear
what
you
think
of
the
new
song
and
video.
Let
us
know,
and
we'll
join
you,
Jinx,
Fishbones
and
Pow-Pow
on
the
battlefield
in
an
upcoming
patch!
Development
Jinx
introduced
herself
to
the
League
of
Legends
community
by
vandalizing
various
pages
on
the
League
of
Legends
website.
[3]
Rough
translation
of
her
graffiti
on
the
LA
website:
The
terms
here
referred
are
tasted
by
my
cultured
(and
slimy)
tongue
over
and
over
again,
as
a
sweet
snack,
with
real
linguistic
passion.
The
writer,
tastes
the
words
with
pleasure
(and
drool)
,
biting
them
with
the
teeth
(big
ones,
all
red
and
crooked)
,
to
soften
them
with
finesse
and
discretion
until,
harmoniously,
every
word
bleeds
(my
eyes,
my
eyes!)
and
so
I
can
get
conclusions
(silly
and
senseless)
,
which
if
everyone
approves
or
not
is
subject
to
a
treaty
(have
you
tried
to
shut
that
big
mouth,
Mr.
Bug?)
that
my
leisure
doesn't
let
me
write,
because
the
bone
of
literary
hedonism
(that
hurts!)
lies
in
the
flavour
(of
destruction
with
cookies)
of
all
the
things
and
not
in
their
way
through
the
digestive
tract
(of
the
most
chaotic
chaos).
Of
course,
that
is
just
my
humble
(and
boooring)
opinion.
However,
in
this
3rd

blah
blah)
