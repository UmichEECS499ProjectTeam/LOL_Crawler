Trivia
Malphite
was
designed
by
Coronach
.
When
Malphite
uses
his
Ground
Slam
attack,
he
leaves
a
glowing
imprint
of
the
Riot
Games
logo.
Malphite
is
one
of
the
few
champions
to
actually
have
multiple
textures
per
skin.
When
his
passive
Granite
Shield
breaks,
he
appears
to
be
molten
underneath
until
the
passive
recharges,
which
reverts
him
to
normal;
and
when
he
activates
Brutal
Strikes
,
his
body
and
arms
glow.
Malphite's
original
cost
was
3150
,
but
was
lowered
to
1350
on
April
12,
2011.
Malphite's
dance
resembles
Capoeira
called
Ginga.
A
side-by-side
comparison
can
be
seen
here
.
Quotes
His
joke
"Caught
between
a
rock
and
a
hard
place"
is
an
idiom,
where
you're
either
in
a
difficult
position
or
have
to
make
an
unpleasant
choice.
Skins
Shamrock
Malphite
may
have
been
inspired
by
the
famous
Blarney
Stone
in
Ireland.
Obsidian
Malphite
may
have
been
inspired
by
the
Destroyers
of
Guild
Wars
.
Marble
Malphite
may
have
been
influenced
by
the
World
of
Warcraft
zone
Nagrand.
Glacial
Malphite
may
be
a
reference
to
Ymir,
an
primeval
figure
in
Norse
mythology
sometimes
associated
with
ice.
Lore
Relations
Malphite
comes
from
another
world
called
the
Monolith.
It
is
a
place
of
perfect
harmony,
where
all
of
its
denizens
are
but
singular
pieces
of
a
whole.
Though
he
disagrees
with
Maokai's
view
of
life
as
a
curse,
Malphite
stated
that
he
is
"...
proud
to
call
the
Twisted
Treant
my
ally",
suggesting
that
the
two
elementals
get
along
quite
well,
despite
their
differences.
Malphite
meditates
near
the
caverns
surrounding
the
Institute
of
War
.
