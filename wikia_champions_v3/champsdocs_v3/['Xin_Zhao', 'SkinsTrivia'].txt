Trivia
Xin
Zhao
was
designed
by
Geeves
.
Xin
Zhao
was
released
concurrently
with
Season
One
.
Xin
Zhao
is
voiced
by
Richard
Epcar
.
Xin
Zhao
has
one
of
the
longest
base
auto
attack
ranges
out
of
all
the
melee
champions,
tied
with
Jarvan
IV
,
Wukong
,
Fizz
,
Nautilus
,
Hecarim
,
and
Yasuo
.
In
the
Chinese
version
of
the
game,
Xin
Zhao's
name
is
rendered
as
Zhao
Xin
(赵信),
as
Chinese
names
are
written
with
their
family
name
first.
In
Traditional
Chinese
and
in
Japanese,
the
name
would
be
written
as
趙信,
while
being
pronounced
as
"Choushin"
via
on'yomi.
His
name
Xin
(信)
means
"faith"
or
"trust"
in
Chinese.
"Zhao"
in
Chinese
is
a
unique
character,
only
usable
as
a
last
name.
However,
it
is
mainly
due
to
being
written
in
Simplified
Chinese.
The
Traditional
version
of
the
character
is
written
as
趙
which
can
also
be
used
in
Japanese,
which
literally
means
"nimble".
He
shares
the
family
name
of
Zhao
Yun
(赵云),
a
famous
general
during
the
Three
Kingdoms
Era
and
a
friend
of
Liu
Bei.
Like
Yun,
he
uses
a
spear
as
weapon.
He
may
also
be
named
after
Zhao
Xin
,
a
Han
general.
Xin
Zhao
is
the
only
champion
that
references
Asian
culture
but
does
not
belong
to
Ionia.
Quotes
Xin
Zhao's
joke
is
a
reference
to
the
question,
"What
happens
when
an
unstoppable
force
meets
an
immovable
object?"
This
in
turn
is
a
reference
to
the
Chinese
word
Maodun
,
矛盾
(lit.
spear
and
shield)
which
means
"Contradiction".
In
the
French
version
of
the
game,
Xin
Zhao's
/joke
is
different.
It
is
a
reference
to
The
Blue
Lotus
of
The
Adventures
of
Tintin
comic
book
series.
In
the
German
version
of
the
game,
Xin
Zhao's
joke
translates
to:
"Find
me
an
immovable
object,
so
that
I
can
bury
you
under
it!"
Skins
Winged
Hussar
Xin
Zhao
Promo
[1]
Imperial
Xin
Zhao
is
likely
a
reference
to
the
famed
Chinese
general
Zhao
Yun
,
whom
Xin
Zhao
shares
many
characteristics
with.
Viscero
Xin
Zhao
is
a
reference
to
his
time
as
a
gladiator
fighting
in
the
Noxian
arena,
The
Fleshing
.
Winged
Hussar
Xin
Zhao
is
a
commemorative
skin
created
to
celebrate
the
launch
of
League
of
Legend's
Polish
servers.
Polish
hussars
were
a
type
of
cavalry
fielded
by
Poland,
and
later
by
the
Polish-Lithuanian
Commonwealth
in
the
XVI
and
XVII
century.
They
were
famed
for
their
deadly
charges.
Commando
Xin
Zhao
is
a
reference
to
the
Imperial
Guard
from
the
Warhammer
40k
series.
Warring
Kingdoms
Xin
Zhao
is
a
homage
to
Koei's
design
of
Zhao
Yun
from
Dynasty
Warriors
,
a
game
based
on
Romance
of
the
Three
Kingdoms
.
Coincidentally,
Richard
Epcar,
Xin
Zhao's
voice
actor,
has
done
a
few
roles
in
the
Koei
Warriors
franchise,
namely
Shingen
Takeda
in
the
first
Samurai
Warriors
game
and
its
expansion,
but
more
so
Dong
Zhuo
ever
since
Dynasty
Warriors
4.
Warring
Kingdoms
Xin
Zhao
shares
the
Warring
Kingdoms
with
Warring
Kingdoms
Jarvan
IV
and
Warring
Kingdoms
Tryndamere
,
with
all
three
referenced
characters
being
featured
in
the
Koei
Warriors
franchise.
Relations
Xin
Zhao
was
saved
from
Noxian
imprisonment
by
Jarvan
IV's
grandfather,
Jarvan
Lightshield
the
Second.
