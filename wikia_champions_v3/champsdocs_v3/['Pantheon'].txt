Abilities
Aegis

Passive:
After
autoattacking
or

next
incoming
basic

deal
more

Ability
Details

a

ability.
Additional
Information:
Aegis
Protection
does
not
consistently
negate
on-hit
effects
that
would
be
applied
with
the
blocked
attack.
On-hit
crowd
control
effects
are
never
blocked,
such
as
Shield
of
Daybreak
and
Ruthless
Predator
,
although
their
damage
may
be.
Three

not
blocked
are
Twisted
Fate's
Pick
A
Card
,
Poppy's
Devastating
Blow
and
Mordekaiser's
Mace
of

these
attacks
are
entirely
magic
damage
and
do
not
deal
any
physical
damage
to
trigger
Aegis
Protection
.
Aegis
Protection
will
also
block
all
abilities
that
apply
on-hit
effects,
such
as
Parrrley
or
Mystic
Shot
.

as
a
critical

for
the
purposes
of
Frenzy
.
While
described
as

Ability
Details
Grand
Skyfall
is
a
channeled
,
ground
targeted,
point
blank
area
of
effect
blink
.
Applies
spell
effects
as
an
area
of
effect
ability.
Spell
vamp
is
reduced
to
one-third
effectiveness.
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
will
apply
a
15%
slow.
Magic
damage
will
be
mitigated
by
Black
Shield
and
Lifeline
.
Spell
shields
will
block
the
damage.
Additional
Information:
Grand
Skyfall
will
go
on
a
reduced
cooldown
regardless
of
how
the
channeling
was
cancelled,
whether
it
was
manually
done
or
via
hard
crowd
control
.
However,
the
mana
cost
of
the
cast
is
not
refunded.
Pantheon
is
considered
to
have
moved
to
his
target
location
as
soon
as
he
completes
his
first
channel.
Although
he
visually
leaves
the
entire
screen
midway
through
the
ability,
Pantheon
is
still
considered
to
be
targetable
for
the
entire
channel.
The
damage
of
the
ability
will
still
occur
if
Pantheon
is
CC'd
before
he
lands.
Abilities
that
Pantheon
casts
on
enemies
near
to
his
destination
will
queue
up
and
execute
as
soon
as
he
lands,
even
if
the
targets
move
out
of
range
before
he
does
so.
