Lulu
Champion
Background

Trivia
Lore
Perhaps
more
than
any
other
champion
in
the
League
,
Lulu
marches
to
the
beat
of
her
own
drum.
During
her
youth
in
Bandle
City
,
she
spent
most
of
her
time
wandering
alone
in
the
forest
or
lost
in
a
daydream.
It
wasn’t
that
she
was
antisocial;
the
day-to-day
bustle
of
Bandle
City
just
couldn't
compete
with
the
vibrant
world
of
her
imagination.
She
saw
wonder
in
places
most
people
overlooked.
This
was
how
she
found
Pix,
a
fae
spirit,
pretending
to
be
stuck
in
a
birdhouse.
Lulu's
imagination
distinguished
her
to
Pix,
and
he
seized
the
opportunity
to
lure
her
into
his
life.
He
brought
her
to
the
Glade,
the
enchanted
home
of
the
fae,
which
lay
nestled
in
a
clearing
in
the
woods.
There
the
rigid
properties
of
the
outside
world
-
things
like
size
and
color
-
changed
as
frequently
and
whimsically
as
the
direction
of
the
wind.
Lulu
felt
at
home
in
the
Glade
and
she
lingered
there
with
Pix,
fascinated
by
this
secret
place.
She
quickly
lost
track
of
time.
Her
life
in
the
Glade
was
comfortable,
natural.
She
and
Pix
played
fae
games
together,
the
sorts
of
games
that
she
had
been
told
were
"only
pretend,"
and
she
got
exceedingly
good
at
them.
It
caught
her
by
surprise
when
she
suddenly
remembered
that
she
had
left
a
life
behind
in
Bandle
City.
The
Glade
had
a
way
of
making
everything
outside
seem
distant
and
surreal.
Lulu
decided
to
revisit
her
former
home,
to
share
some
of
the
lovely
things
she'd
learned,
but
when
she
and
Pix
returned
the
world
had
changed.
Time,
she
discovered,
was
another
property
that
behaved
differently
in
the
Glade,
and
centuries
had
passed
while
she
was
away.
Lulu
sought
to
reconnect
to
the
residents
of
the
outside
world,
but
her
attempt
had
unfortunate
results.
She
led
all
the
children
off
to
play
hide
and
seek,
temporarily
changing
them
into
flowers
and
animals
to
spice
up
the
game,
but
their
parents
didn't
appreciate
her
efforts.
When
the
yordles
insisted
that
she
leave
their
land,
she
turned
to
a
vibrant,
magic
place
where
those
with
unusual
gifts
were
not
just
accepted
but
adored:
the
League
of
Legends.
"The
best
path
between
two
points
is
upside-down,
between,
then
inside-out
and
round
again."
―
Lulu

Lulu,
the
Fae
Sorceress
Revealed
Announcement
made
by
NeeksNaman.
[1]
"Greetings,
Summoners!
A
few
people
have
been
asking
when
we'll
be
adding
another
support
champion
to
League
of
Legends.
I'm
happy
to
answer
that
with
a
resounding
"now!"
Join
me
in
welcoming
Lulu,
the
Fae
Sorceress,
as
our
newest
support
champion.
As
a
yordle
(or
"suppordle,"
in
this
case),
Lulu
brings
a
sense
of
twisted
mischief
to
the
League.
With
the
help
of
her
fairy
companion
Pix,
she
is
equally
adept
at
disabling
foes
as
she
is
assisting
and
supporting
allies.
Is
the
enemy
Nocturne
being
a
big
jerk
and
killing
your
friends?
Is
that
Alistar
just
not
squirrelly
enough
for
you?
That's
an
easy
fix
with
a
quick
cast
of
Whimsy,
which
will
make
an
enemy
champion
100%
more
adorable
and
100%
more
harmless
by
turning
them
into
a
fuzzy
critter
that
can
run
around,
but
can't
attack
or
use
abilities.
Let's
not
forget
the
support
aspects,
either.
Lulu
features
high-impact,
short-duration
buffs
and
enhancements
that
can
save
a
teammate's
bacon
or
help
to
secure
a
kill.
Making
an
ally
move
quickly
can
pull
their
feet
out
of
the
fire
quickly,
while
Pix
can
lend
his
own
aid
by
flying
next
to
a
friendly
champion,
attacking
in
concert
and
providing
protection.
Her
ultimate,
however,
is
the
final
word
in
allied
buffs
–
granting
a
size
increase
along
with
a
health
bonus
to
match.
The
rapid
increase
in
size
briefly
stuns
nearby
enemies,
as
well
as
granting
the
affected
champion
an
aura
that
slows
enemies
in
a
nearby
area.
This
buff
can
be
just
what
the
doctor
ordered
if
a
fully
grown
Cho'Gath
simply
isn't
big
enough!
Finally,
Lulu's
bag
of
tricks
encompasses
the
ability
to
use
some
of
her
spells
on
either
allies
or
enemies.
While
Lulu's
fairy
companion
can
support
a
friend,
he
can
also
harass
an
enemy
by
flying
around
them
and
acting
as
a
major
hindrance.
We've
worked
hard
to
not
only
create
an
impactful
and
satisfying
support
champion,
but
also
one
that
fits
well
within
League
of
Legends.
We're
confident
that
there
are
still
a
lot
of
support
styles
that
are
yet
to
be
explored
in
League
of
Legends,
and
that
one
of
them
combines
buffs
and
disables
together
in
one
package
to
help
your
team
turn
the
tide
of
battle.
Lulu
will
provide
you
with
exciting
new
options
as
a
support
player
on
the
Fields
of
Justice."
