before
you
attack
again,

is
not
lost.

Ability
Details

a
self-buff
and
a
delayed

of
effect
.

spell
effects
as
an
area
of
effect
ability.

be
mitigated
by
Black
Shield
and
Lifeline
.
Spell
shields
will
block
the
damage.
Additional
Information:
Has
no
cast
time.
Because
the
decoy
is
stopped
and
won't
attack,
it
is
possible
to
bluff
this
ability
by
stopping
Wukong.
The
decoy
is
left
in
the
stop
position,
but
instantly.
Because
the
transition
frames
from
movement
animation
to
stop
animation
are
missing,
an
experienced
enemy
can
tell
the
difference.
The
decoy
counts
as
a
champion
for
purposes
of
being
targeted,
such
as
Caitlyn's
Ace
in
the
Hole
.
If
the
decoy
is
killed
before
it
vanishes,
it
will
not
deal
any
damage.
