Ability
Details
Chomp
is
an
on-hit
effect
.
The
triggering
attack
will
apply
other
on-hit
effects
and
can
critically
strike
as
normal.
As
with
most
on-hit
physical
damage,
the
bonus
damage
from
Chomp
will
apply
life
steal
.
Critical
strikes
will
not
factor
in
the
additional
base
damage
of
the
attack
but
will
benefit
from
the
additional
AD
ratio.
The
bonus
damage
will
affect
structures.
Chomp's
damage
will
be
mitigated
if
Trundle's
attack
is
blocked
,
dodged
or
parried
.
Chomp's
empowerment
will
be
consumed
if
the
attack
misses
.

both
cases
listed
above
Chomp
will
still
steal/enhance
AD.
Spell
shields
will
block
the
ability.

not
gain
