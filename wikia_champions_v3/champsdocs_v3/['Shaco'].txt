Abilities
Backstab
Shaco
deals
20%
bonus
damage
when
striking
a
unit
from
behind
with
his
basic
attacks
or
abilities.
Ability
Details
Backstab
is
a
passive
ability
that
triggers
when
Shaco
attacks
or
uses
an
ability
on
a
unit
that
is
facing
away
from
him.
Additional
Information:
Backstab's
bonus
damage
applies
to
Shaco's
autoattacks
and
abilities,
except
for
Jack
In
The
Box
.
Backstab
does
not
increase
the
damage
from
summoner
spells
or
items.
Backstab
also
applies
after
a
critical
strike
is
achieved.
If
you
were
to
critically
strike
for
500
damage,
the
same
critical
strike
would
do
600
damage
from
behind
(500dmg
+20%
=
600dmg).
Deceive
Range:

Cooldown:

Active:
Shaco
instantly
blinks
to
a
target
nearby
location
and
enters
stealth
for
up
to
3.5
seconds.
Dealing
damage
will
break
stealth
early.
His
next
basic
attack
within
6
seconds
is
guaranteed
to
critically
strike
for
modified
base
critical
damage.
Bonus
critical
damage
from
items,
runes
and
mastery
is
applied
for
the
full
amount.

Ability
Details
Deceive
is
a
ground
targeted
blink
ability
.
Additional
Information:
Deceive's
damage
bonus
replaces
the
normal
critical
strike
modifier,
causing
it
to
actually
do
less
than
a
normal
critical
until
the
skill
is
at
least
at
rank
4.
It
is
affected
by
critical
damage
bonuses
like
Infinity
Edge
.
Deceive
will
apply
bonus
critical
damage
on
top
of
its
modifier.
For
instance,
with
Infinity
Edge
(+50%)
and
Rank
5
Deceive,
Shaco
will
deal
bonus
damage
equal
to
270%
of
his
attack
damage.
This
is
before
any
other
bonuses
or
mitigation
are
applied.
Note
that
if
Shaco
were
to
attack
the
target
from
behind
it
would
deal
20%
additional
damage
on
top
of
the
critical
strike
itself.
Deceive's
casting
animation
(an
orange
puff
of
smoke)
can
be
seen
by
both
teams
through
the
Fog
of
War
.

Details
Jack
in
the
Box
is
a
ground
targeted
ability
that
places
a
pet
at
the
target
location.
Does
not
apply
spell
effects
.
Magic
damage
will
be
mitigated
by
Black
Shield
and
Lifeline
.
Spell
shields
will
block
the
fear,
but
not
the
attacks.
Additional
Information:
Casting
Jack
In
The
Box
creates
a
puff
of
smoke
that
is
visible
even
through
brush
and
the
fog
of
war,
and
makes
a
distinctive
sound
that
can
be
heard
by
enemies.
Boxes
are
immune
to
ability
damage
and
displacement
effects
while
in
stealth.
As
such,
they
can
be
used
to
block
skill
shots.
Boxes
will
not
be
triggered
by
enemies
that
Shaco
does
not
have
sight
of.
As
boxes
grant
sight,
this
is
only
true
against
stealthed
enemies,
or
while
Shaco
is
affected
by
Paranoia
and
Smokescreen
).
Stealthed
boxes
will
be
revealed
and
disabled
by
Sweeping
Lens
.
The
fear
can
affect
stealthed
enemy
champions,
but
it
will
not
reveal
them
unless
the
target's
stealth
state
depends
on
their
location
or
movement
(e.g.
Teemo's
Camouflage
or
Akali's
Twilight
Shroud
).

Ability
Details
Hallucinate
is
a
self-targeted
ability.
Applies
spell
effects
as
an
area
of
effect
ability.
Spell
vamp
is
reduced
to
one-third
effectiveness.
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
will
apply
a
15%
slow.
The
clone
will
apply
on
hit-effects
just
a
Shaco
would.
Magic
damage
will
be
mitigated
by
Black
Shield
and
Lifeline
.
Spell
shields
will
block
the
clone's
explosion.
Additional
Information:
The
clone
will
not
apply
spell
effects
with
its
attacks,
just
its
explosion.
While
the
clone
is
active,
you
can
use
the
spell
again
in
order
to
issue
commands,
similarly
with
Alt-Right
Clicking.
Each
"activation"
of
the
spell
will
cause
the
clone
to
move
towards
the
cursor
location
or
to
attack
whichever
enemy
unit
the
cursor
is
hovering
over.
Shaco
briefly
becomes
untargetable
when
casting
Hallucinate.
With
proper
timing,
Hallucinate
can
be
used
to
avoid
projectiles
before
they
hit
him
(e.g.
Caitlyn's
Ace
in
the
Hole
or
Karthus's
Requiem
).
However,
it
cannot
be
used
to
avoid
ticks
of
Ignite
or
Zilean's
Time
Bomb
.
The
duration
timer
will
pause
and
continue
once
Shaco
is
targetable
again.
The
clone
will
receive
its
own
Banshee's
Veil
,
Guardian
Angel
or
other
item
buffs.
The
clone
cannot
be
the
source
of
aura
buffs,
but
it
can
still
be
affected
by
nearby
auras.
Hallucinate
spawns
Shaco
and
his
clone
with
consistent
orientations.
Shaco
faces
the
same
direction
as
he
did
when
the
ability
was
cast.
The
clone
faces
towards
the
top
of
the
screen.
Shaco's
clone
will
benefit
from
certain
stats
gained
from
items
such
as:
attack
speed
and
crit
chance.
Shaco's
Clone
will
not
benefit
from
certain
item
effects
such
as:
Spellblade
and
Youmuu's
Ghostblade
's
active
Runes
and
Masteries
do
not
increase
the
clones
stats.
The
clone
displays
its
real
stats,
which
makes
it
fairly
easy
to
find
the
real
Shaco.
Shaco's
Clone
is
also
capable
of
picking
up
Health
Relics
on
Dominion
and
Howling
Abyss.
Shaco's
Clone
cannot
