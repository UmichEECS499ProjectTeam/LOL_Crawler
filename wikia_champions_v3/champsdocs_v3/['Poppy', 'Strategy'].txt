Poppy's
Valiant
Fighter
tooltip
can
be
misleading.
50%
damage
reduction
only
applies
to
the
portion
of
damage
that
actually
exceeds
10%
of
Poppy's
current
health,
not
entire
damage
of
that
attack.
Example:
Poppy
has
1200/2000
health
and
is
being
hit
by
a
400
damage
nuke
(after
resistances).
She
will
then
take:
1200*10%
regular
damage
plus
(400-10%*1200)*50%
reduced
damage,
which
will
total
in
120
+
140
=
260
damage
taken.
Poppy's
Valiant
Fighter
procs
against
most
attacks,
especially
burst
DPS
and
mages,
but
is
less
effective
against
numerous
small
attacks
from
minions
or
enemies
with
high
attack
speed
and
low
damage.
Paragon
of
Demacia
can
be
offensive
or
defensive,
allowing
Poppy
to
run
away
or
charge
straight
at
the
enemy.
Maxing
Paragon
of
Demacia
first
can
give
you
that
little
bit
extra
to
win
a
fight,
kill
an
enemy
or
take
down
a
turret.
Use
Exhaust
or
Flash
when
an
enemy
is
near
a
wall
to
position
yourself
so
you
can
successfully
use
Heroic
Charge
to
its
fullest
extent.
When
chasing
an
enemy,
remember
that
it
is
often
easier
to
ram
them
into
a
wall
with
Heroic
Charge
and
stun
them
then
attack
them
when
you
catch
up
to
them.
Maneuver
to
the
side
of
them
so
that
the
charge
will
bring
them
into
a
wall.
This
can
be
made
easier
by
using
Paragon
of
Demacia
when
maneuvering
around
to
their
side.
Heroic
Charge
stuns
when
pushing
an
enemy
champion
into
surrounding
terrain,
also
included
in
"terrain"
are
towers.
Even
after
a
tower
is
destroyed,
the
rubble
leftover
is
still
included
as
"terrain."
Nexuses
and
inhibitors
are
also
terrain.
Anivia's
Crystallize
,
Trundle's
Pillar
of
Ice
and
Jarvan
IV's
Cataclysm
do
not
count
as
terrain
for
Heroic
Charge
,
causing
Poppy
and
her
target
to
move
through
the
wall
instead
of
colliding
with
it.
Heroic
Charge
can
be
used
to
charge
across
impassible
terrain,
so
long
as
it
is
in
between
you
and
your
target.
This
is
usually
unexpected
and
a
great
way
to
either
jump
an
enemy
who
flees
too
closely
to
a
wall
when
you
are
on
the
opposite
side,
or
can
be
used
to
charge
to
neutral
minions
on
the
other
side
of
a
wall
in
the
jungle,
to
escape.
Keep
in
mind
that
you
must
have
vision
of
the
target,
and
thus
this
isn't
often
possible
when
chasing
an
enemy
by
yourself.
Early
on,
your
EQ
combo
damage
will
be
increased
more
by
putting
points
into
Heroic
Charge
rather
than
Devastating
Blow
.
By
mid
game,
Devastating
Blow
is
more
important
as
you
want
to
get
your
cooldown
to
the
point
where
you
can
spam
the
skill
in
team
fights.
Keep
in
mind
that
this
difference
between
early
and
mid
game
is
levels
1-5
vs
levels
6-15.
Diplomatic
Immunity
boosts
all
damage
you
inflict
including
summoner
spells
and
Item
actives.
This
includes
Hextech
Gunblade
and
Deathfire
Grasp
.
Diplomatic
Immunity
is
very
useful
against
ganks
and
in
team
fights.
It
can
also
be
used
to
tower
dive
very
effectively.
While
Diplomatic
Immunity
is
activated,
towers
cannot
damage
you
until
either
your
target
dies,
or
the
duration
ends.
After
tower
diving,
you
can
use
Flash
,
Paragon
of
Demacia
,
Ghost
,
or
Heroic
Charge
a
minion
to
make
a
quick
escape.
Diplomatic
Immunity
is
useful
in
teamfights
when
used
on
a
weaker
enemy,
and
using
the
immunity
to
damage
all
their
more
dangerous
teammates
while
taking
minimal
damage.
Poppy
is
a
great
roamer
with
Paragon
of
Demacia
allowing
her
to
move
quickly
throughout
the
map
disrupting
enemy
solo
lanes
with
her
Heroic
Charge
.
Poppy
is
also
able
to
return
to
lane
much
quicker
with
Paragon
of
Demacia
.
The
8%
bonus
damage
from
Devastating
Blow
causes
the
skill
to
scale
well
with
your
opponent's
Health
up
to
some
threshold
based
on
skill
Rank.
At
Rank
1
the
75
damage
threshold
is
reached
when
your
opponent
has
937.5
health
(687.5
*
8%).

Build
usage
Poppy
has
the
ability
to
perform
two
kind
of
roles
deriving
from
what
items
she
takes:
assassin
or
bruiser.
It
is
up
to
the
players
discretion
what
works
best,
and
results
vary
from
game
to
game
(and
even
maps).
For
a
larger
analysis
and
discussion,
please
refer
to
the
[
Talk
Page
]
Getting
Trinity
Force
or
Lich
Bane
is
a
good
idea,
as
when
she
casts
a
spell
her
next
hit
will
do
bonus
damage,
as
the
effects
stack
with
Devastating
Blow
:
this
will
be
a
force
to
be
reckoned
with.
Diplomatic
Immunity
damage
modifier
works
with
items
as
well.
Items
such
as
Thornmail
,
Hextech
Gunblade
or
Deathfire
Grasp
will
all
deal
amplified
damage.
Both
Void
Staff
and
Last
Whisper
can
be
effective
depending
on
your
build,
but
investing
in
both
is
generally
too
costly.
When
building
Poppy
with
attack
damage
items,
you
will
still
able
to
do
considerable
damage
to
heavily
armoured
foes
as
Devastating
Blow
deals
magic
damage
only
-
including
your
attack
damage.
Poppy's
signature
spam-ability,
Devastating
Blow
,
does
not
benefit
from
critical
chance
or
life
steal,
greatly
reducing
the
effectiveness
of
those
stats
and
making
other
attack
damage
items
a
more
desirable
purchase.
Due
to
Valiant
Fighter
,
the
effective
health
from
spell
vamp
and
lifesteal
effects
is
magnified
greatly
when
Poppy
is
on
low
HP.
Due
to
Poppy's
Devastating
Blow
and
Heroic
Charge
being
single
target
spells,
a
Hextech
Gunblade
or
Will
of
the
Ancients
can
easily
allow
you
to
restore
hundreds
of
health
on
a
single
Devastating
Blow
.
Lifesteal
items
such
as
Ravenous
Hydra
or
The
Bloodthirster
will
have
the
same
effect,
although
be
a
more
stable
method
of
sustainability.
Maw
of
Malmortius
synergizes
particularly
well
with
Valiant
Fighter
,
making
Poppy
both
exceptionally
damaging
and
exceptionally
resilient
at
low
health.
Since
Poppy's
Valiant
Fighter
,
is
most
effective
when
she
is
at
low
health,
she
can
make
herself
extraordinarily
difficult
to
kill
with
Guardian
Angel
.

Do
not
stay
too
close
to
terrain
in
order
to
prevent
Poppy's
Heroic
Charge
stun.
Beware
of
Poppy's
late
game
potential
if
she
manages
to
farm
up
gold.
Poppy
is
one
of
the
most
powerful
late
game
champions
in
the
game
and
can
sometimes
kill
several
members
on
your
team
during
Diplomatic
Immunity's
duration.
Thus,
denying
Poppy
farm
will
have
a
huge
impact
on
her
effectiveness.
One
good
counter
pick
as
lane
opponent
is
Olaf
who
can
sustain
while
dealing
a
large
amount
of
true
damage
which
bypasses
Valiant
Fighter
(note
that
it
does
not
bypass
Diplomatic
Immunity's
effect).
Ignite
is
the
easiest
way
to
kill
a
low
life
Poppy
,
since
her
passive
makes
her
otherwise
extremely
resilient
against
magical
and
physical
damage.
Beware
of
recalling
behind
a
tower
when
Poppy's
Diplomatic
Immunity
is
off
cooldown.
One
common
strategy
used
by
Poppy
is
ulting
the
support
(since
supports
have
the
least
damage
output),
and
then
focusing
the
enemy
carry.
Support
champions
with
good
CC
such
as
Janna
can
help
counter
this.
But
in
general,
picking
a
team
which
have
a
lot
of
CC
waiting
for
Poppy
whenever
she
uses
her
ulti
on
will
have
a
dramatic
impact
on
her
performance
in
teamfights,
no
matter
the
role
of
the
champion.
Poppy
counters
AD
carries
such
as
Ashe
or
Kog'Maw
extremely
effectively
if
she
manages
to
get
another
target
for
Diplomatic
Immunity
,
due
to
them
having
no
escape
mechanisms
and
their
CC
being
ineffective
against
her.
Champions
such
as
Vayne
with
her
stealth
from
Final
Hour
->
Tumble
or
Tristana
with
Rocket
Jump
are
more
effective.
Stacking
magic
resistance
over
health
is
useful
to
mitigate
the
damage
from
Poppy's
Devastating
Blow
.
Due
to
Poppy's
Valiant
Fighter
,
she
is
naturally
strong
against
burst
champions,
such
as
Kennen
or
Akali
.
Rather
than
sending
one
of
these
champions
to
lane
against
her,
have
a
magic
damage
DoT
-centered
champion
like
Malzahar
or
Swain
lane
against
her,
effectively
shutting
her
down.
She
has
no
magic
resistance
per
level,
making
them
very
efficient
counters
against
her.
Fast
attack
speed
champions
with
Wit's
End
or
Statikk
Shiv
are
also
good
against
her
Valiant
Fighter
due
to
being
a
small,
consistent
damage
source
below
the
10%
threshold.
