Trivia
Lore
The
earliest
account
of
Swain's
existence
comes
from
a
Noxian
infirmary
doctor's
notes.
According
to
them,
Swain
limped
into
the
ward
without
cry
or
complaint:
his
right
leg
was
snapped
in
half,
with
bone
protruding
from
the
skin.
A
small,
scowling
bird
seemed
affixed
to
his
shoulder.
The
doctor
gawked
in
horror
as
the
young
adolescent
answered
questions
about
his
health
and
age
with
a
calm,
even
stare.
Even
behind
the
echoing
crack
as
the
sand
counterweights
reset
his
tibia,
Swain’s
measuring
gaze
never
flickered,
nor
did
his
eyes
twitch
from
the
pop
of
his
fibula.
He
refused
the
doctor’s
recommendation
of
magical
treatment
for
the
leg’s
inoperable
damage,
requesting
only
a
spare
crutch
before
shuffling
away.
He
next
surfaced
in
documents
from
the
Noxian
military,
although
it
is
evident
that
they
are
incomplete.
Normally
a
crippled
boy
would
be
turned
away
in
shame
from
Noxus’
proud
legion,
but
the
records
indicate
his
first
designation
was
that
of
a
ranking
officer.
The
men
who've
served
under
him
(and
survived)
have
remained
in
his
charge
with
unshakable
faith
and
loyalty.
He
leapt
through
the
High
Command's
hierarchy,
often
ascending
when
superiors
requested
demotions
to
join
his
unit.
A
cunning
strategist,
Swain
was
decorated
after
every
battle
he
fought,
regularly
hobbling
in
contemplation
at
the
front
of
the
assault.
His
rise
to
power
seemed
unceasing
until
he
was
suddenly
relegated
to
inactive
status
prior
to
the
Ionian
Invasion
-
a
bewildering
decision
which
reeked
of
bureaucratic
subversion.
If
Swain
was
upset
by
the
events
which
unfolded,
he
never
believed
it.
His
face
was
so
implacable
that
it
was
popularly
rumored
to
be
a
mask,
disguising
something
utterly
inhuman
beneath.
More
controversy
surrounded
the
bird
that
never
left
his
shoulder,
whose
name
he
whispered
only
to
it.
When
Demacia
escalated
its
presence
in
the
League
,
Swain
was
immediately
returned
to
active
duty.
"If
you
haven't
yet
lost
the
ability
to
ask,
you
may
not
yet
ask
for
relief."
―
Swain
Swain
Seizes
Power
in
Noxus
Main
article:
Noxus
Katarina
and
Talon
arrive
in
Noxus
to
witness
Swain's
coronation
as
Grand
General.
Jericho
Swain
defeated
Keiran
Darkwill
in
a
duel
contesting
the
leadership
of
Noxus
last
night,
winning
the
support
of
High
Command.
Despite
rumors
of
involvement
with
the
Institute
of
War's
scandal
in
Kalamanda
,
Swain
has
been
named
Grand
General
–
the
highest
position
in
Noxus.
High
Command
remained
divided
in
support
between
the
two
men
since
Swain
returned
Swain
as
the
Grand
General
of
Noxus
earlier
this
month.
Keiran
Darkwill
challenged
Swain
to
a
duel
to
settle
the
dispute,
claiming
that
such
a
standstill
was
a
"coward’s
game."
Many
members
of
High
Command
believed
this
to
be
a
strong
move
and
expected
Keiran,
a
notoriously
skilled
duelist,
to
win.
Keiran
initially
had
the
upper
hand
but
due
to
Swain's
magical
tactics,
Keiran
surprisingly
lost.
The
gathered
members
of
High
Command
unanimously
agreed
to
swear
loyalty
to
the
Master
Tactician.
With
none
remaining
to
protest
his
claim,
High
Command
named
Jericho
Swain
the
Grand
General
of
Noxus.
While
High
Command
has
embraced
his
rule,
Swain’s
leadership
remains
controversial
in
Noxus's
lower
houses.
Some
accuse
Swain
of
willing
participation
in
Heywan
Relivash’s
scheme
to
obtain
Kalamanda.

CLE
OBSERVATION
Swain
arches
his
neck
toward
the
words
that
hang
over
the
massive
double
doors.
“The
truest
opponent
lies
within.”
“How
quaint.”
Swain’s
voice
sounds
surprisingly
robust
for
such
a
seemingly
frail
figure.
His
uniform
–
more
robe
than
military
dress
–
is
wrapped
tightly
about
him,
especially
around
his
face.
He
stands
crookedly;
he
leans
on
a
cane
to
support
himself,
but
not
overly
so.
It
does
not
seem
out
of
place
to
see
a
strange-looking
raven
perched
on
his
shoulder.
Perhaps
this
is
to
whom
Swain
is
speaking.
“Let’s
see
who
the
League
believes
my
truest
opponent
is
–
shall
we?”
The
raven
nods
its
head
in
affirmation.
Swain
deftly
raps
on
the
double
doors
with
the
head
of
his
cane.
They
split,
revealing
blackness
within.
The
engraved
panthers
along
either
side
of
the
double
doors
point
inward.
There
is
a
slight
smirk
on
his
face
as
he
enters.
REVELATION
The
ink
on
the
Noxian
and
Demacian
armistice
had
been
but
a
few
years
dry
before
the
first
“incident”
took
place
between
the
powerful
city-states.
It
was
right
in
the
midst
of
that
botched
mission,
at
the
moment
of
execution,
where
Swain
now
found
himself
at.
He
could
see
the
platform
where
the
young
prince
was
standing,
his
back
turned,
oblivious
to
his
plight.
The
poison-bolted
hexbow
felt
heavy
in
Swain’s
hands.
“I
am
impressed.
I
didn’t
expect
it
to
be
so
real.”
He
scanned
the
darkened
balcony
overlooking
where
the
Demacian
royals
were
standing.
The
cold
night
air
was
brisk.
Swain
breathed,
inhaling
deeply.
“And
accurate.
This
is
nearly
intoxicating.”
“What
is,
Swine?”
A
commanding
voice
mocked
the
Noxian.
Jarvan
IV,
the
Exemplar
of
Demacia,
Crown
Prince
of
the
same,
now
stood
on
the
balcony.
His
presence
lorded
over
Swain.
Jarvan
was
no
longer
the
thirteen-year
old
child
prince
that
Swain
had
been
sent
to
dispatch.
“How’s
the
leg?”
“You
even
know
about
that.
Powerful,”
Swain
commented,
raising
his
cane
to
his
chin,
“but,
alas,
not
powerful
enough
for
me,
summoner.
Enough.”
Jarvan
looked
stunned,
and
just
a
little
bit
confused.
“I
do
not
play
games
–
I
make
them.
We
are
both
aware
of
what
I
think
happened
during
the
mission
you’re
recreating
here.
You
know
how
I
truly
feel
about
my
weaknesses.
You
clearly
know
who
I
am,
seeing
as
how
you’re
so
blatantly
ransacking
my
memories.”
Swain
happily
leered
at
Jarvan.
“Unless
I
am
mistaken,
this
should
satisfy
half
of
your
prerequisite
needs
for
a
champion’s
entry
into
the
League.”
“It
does?”
a
less-commanding
Jarvan
asked.
His
countenance
was
considerably
less
Demacian
now.
He
paused
for
a
moment,
and
then
nodded.
“Yes,
perhaps
it
does.
We
acknowledge
your
power,
Swain
of
Noxus.”
The
Demacian
prince
was
no
longer
standing
before
Swain.
Where
he
had
stood
there
was
now
an
older,
strikingly
beautiful
woman
in
a
purple
summoner’s
robe.
The
robe
was
highly
ornate,
unlike
most
of
the
other
robes
Swain
had
seen
in
his
time.
The
female
summoner
bowed.
“We
would
ask,
however,
that
you
please
honor
the
League
with
a
formal
acknowledgement.”
Swain
chuckled
and
nodded.
“High
Councilor
Vessaria
Kolminye
–
I
am
honored.
I
was
not
aware
that
someone
of
your
stature
conducted
screenings
personally.
Is
there
a
chance
I
could
expect
you
to
personally
summon
me
into
a
battle
arena?”
Swain
was
clearly
enjoying
this
exchange.
“Charming,
as
always,
Master
Tactician.”
The
High
Councilor
smiled
thinly.
“Your
formal
acknowledgement,
if
you
would
be
so
kind.”
Swain
bowed
deeply,
kicking
his
cane
out
with
a
flourish.
“Of
course.
With
all
due
respect.”
The
Noxian
clutched
his
cane
to
stand
straight.
“You
would
ask
of
me
how
it
feels
to
share
my
mind
with
a
summoner.
As
you
can
see,
I
face
little
challenge
in
managing
such
a
relationship.
While
my
secrets
are
laid
bare
to
the
summoner
that
calls
upon
me,
I
know
that
they
would
not
be
used
against
me
by
the
League.
Such
a
violation
of
trust
is
against
everything
the
League
stands
for...
especially
in
these
most
tense
of
times
when
the
League
needs
the
cooperation
of
its
client
city-states.”
High
Councilor
Kolminye
nodded
approvingly.
“Thank
you,
and
yes
–
the
knowledge
exchanged
in
the
bond
is
private
between
champion
and
summoner.
You
have
nothing
to
fear.”
“Nor
do
you.”
Swain
bowed
again,
keeping
his
eyes
locked
on
the
High
Councilor.
A
tense
pause
was
broken
by
the
High
Councilor.
“Why
do
you
want
to
join
the
League,
Jericho
Swain?”
Swain
took
the
question
in.
The
slight
smug
look
that
he
had
worn
throughout
the
entire
Judgment
was
gone.
He
stared
straight
into
High
Councilor
Kolminye’s
eyes.
“To
become
the
next
ruler
of
Noxus,
of
course.”
Swain
pointed
the
head
of
his
cane
at
the
High
Councilor.
“The
League
will
help
me
accomplish
this.”
“The
League
does
not
arbitrarily
choose
sides
in
the
matters
of
the
city-states
of
Valoran,
nor
does
it
–”
Swain
put
his
index
finger
to
his
lips.
“You
know
what
I
mean...
don’t
you,
Vessaria?”
The
High
Councilor
paused
once
more.
“Yes,
I
do.
But
you’ll
have
to
earn
the
influence
you
need.
It
won’t
come
easily.”
The
High
Councilor
permitted
herself
the
slightest
of
sneers.
“Especially
for
you.”
Her
eyes
were
as
two
red
embers,
flickering
intensely.
“But
that
is
not
all,
is
it,
Master
Tactician?”
Swain
nodded.
“Indeed,
it
is
not.
Your
Judgment...
it
is
quite
the
ritual.
It
is
more
powerful
than
I
had
given
you
credit
for.”
He
leaned
in
to
the
High
Councilor’s
left
ear,
a
breath’s
distance
away.
Swain’s
voice
was
soft,
but
every
word
hung
on
the
air
as
he
spoke.
“I
want
to
kill
Jarvan
IV,
the
‘Exemplar’
of
Demacia.”
He
smiled
at
the
High
Councilor,
still
close
to
her
ear.
“I
will
kill
him
too,
Vessaria.”
High
Councilor
Kolminye
locked
eyes
with
Swain
for
one
last
time.
She
raised
her
right
hand
to
his
cheek.
“We
shall
see,
Jericho.”
A
flood
of
light
washed
over
them
both,
and
Swain
found
himself
alone
in
the
chamber.
A
new
set
of
double
doors
were
in
front
of
him,
already
opened.
The
League
had
found
its
latest
champion.

ByronicHero:
Here
at
Riot
Games,
we're
making
every
attempt
to
ensure
that
we
deliver
exciting
champions

the

a

Meet
Swain,
the
Master
Tactician.
In
addition
to
being
a
distinguished
Noxian
gentleman
of
impeccable
wealth
and
taste,
Swain
also
just
happens
to
be
a
fan
of
our
feathered
friends.
And
like
some
people
who
wind
up
at
the
League
of
Legends,
well...
let's
just
say
that
he's
much
more
than
meets
the
