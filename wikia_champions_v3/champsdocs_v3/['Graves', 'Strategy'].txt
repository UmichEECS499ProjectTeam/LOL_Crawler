Trivia
Skill
usage
Try
to
keep
your
True
Grit
stacks
up
by
attacking
minions,
for
free
damage
mitigation.
During
the
laning
phase,
Buckshot
is
a
strong
harassment
ability,
but
will
quickly
drain
mana
if
used
constantly.
Using
Buckshot
on
caster
minions
will
kill
them
in
a
single
cast
at
higher
ranks,
even
without
damage
items.
Graves
can
push
and
farm
a
lane
easily
by
using
Buckshot
.
However,
Smokescreen
should
be
reserved
due
to
its
relatively
low
damage,
and
high
utility.
For
a
high
damage
combo,
throw
a
Smokescreen
on
your
target,
close
the
gap
with
Quickdraw
,
and
fire
a
close-range
Buckshot
.
The
sight
reduction
of
Smokescreen
has
great
utility,
along
with
the
AoE
slow.
Smokescreen
can
be
used
to
juke
your
enemies
and
allow
Graves
to
make
decisive
choices
when
either
chasing
or
escaping.
It
can
be
used
to
set
up
a
gank,
because
the
target
will
not
be
able
to
see
any
incoming
champions.
A
Smokescreen
can
be
a
strong
deterrent
for
an
oncoming
enemy
team.
Smokescreen
greatly
diminishes
the
utility
of
an
enemy
champion
that
relies
on
ranged
unit-targeted
spells,
such
as
Cassiopeia
or
Annie
because
vision
of
their
target
is
required
to
cast
these
spells.
Graves's
Quickdraw
can
be
used
to
dash
through
thin
terrain.
This
allows
Graves
to
be
very
mobile
and
can
benefit
him
in
chases
and
escapes.
Try
to
use
Collateral
Damage
at
the
beginning
of
a
teamfight
when
your
enemies
are
grouped
together,
allowing
you
to
hit
multiple
targets.
When
the
champion
against
you
has
a
blink
(eg.
Ezreal
),
and
he
attempts
to
engage
you,
throw
a
Smokescreen
to
where
he
blinked,
and
quickly
dash
away
leaving
your
opponent
visionless.
By
using
smart
cast,
you
can
cast
Buckshot
and
Quickdraw
together
in
such
a
way
that
you
dash
back
while
shooting
the
three
bullets
of
Buckshot
in
front
of
you.
Use
this
combo
to
finish
off
enemies
with
low
hp
and
make
a
quick
escape.
Build
usage
Due
to
the
high
AD
ratios
on
Buckshot
and
Collateral
Damage
,
stacking
items
that
provide
AD
is
a
great
way
to
increase
Graves'
damage
output.
Infinity
Edge
and/or
The
Bloodthirster
are
both
excellent
items
on
Graves
.
Similarly,
building
armor
penetration
items
like
The
Black
Cleaver
and
Last
Whisper
can
greatly
increase
his
damage
output
from
the
said
skills
as
they
deal
physical
damage.
The
former
is
more
useful
for
Graves
as
it
not
only
grants
him
a
bit
of
durability
due
to
his
short
range,
but
also
gives
armor
shred
debuff
in
his
AoE
skills
that
is
beneficial
to
your
entire
team.
Due
to
the
fact
that
Graves
has
only
his
Smokescreen
to
slow
enemies,
Frozen
Mallet
(or
Iceborn
Gauntlet
)
gives
him
a
high
utility,
but
it
sacrifices
his
damage
potential.
Cooldown
reduction
and
attack
speed
can
significantly
reduce
Quickdraw's
downtime.
With
enough
attack
speed
to
reach
the
2.5
cap
with
Quickdraw
active,
Quickdraw
can
be
active
continuously.
Runaan's
Hurricane's
passive
lets
Graves
reduce
the
cooldown
of
Quickdraw
three
times
faster,
as
the
2
minor
bolts
are
considered
to
be
auto
attacks.
Despite
being
listed
as
a
default
recommended
offensive
item,
Blade
of
the
Ruined
King
is
an
ill
advised
item
to
rush
on
Graves
since
Graves
have
relatively
high
AD
scaling
skills
and
the
item
does
not
give
enough
AD.
However,
it
synergizes
well
with
Quickdraw
as
it
will
help
reduce
the
CD
of
the
said
ability
thanks
to
the
built
in
attack
speed.
Players
should
take
this
item
into
consideration
as
a
situational
item
when
dealing
with
tanks
buildings
lots
of
health
after
building
enough
AD
and
armor
penetration
with
it's
passive
and
active.

Countering
One
of
Graves'
strengths
is
his
burst.
Try
to
avoid
his
high
burst
and
take
advantage
of
his
high
cooldowns
during
the
early
game.
Also
note
that
Graves'
auto
attack
is
fairly
short
(525
range),
use
this
as
your
advantage
by
playing
poke
based
ADCs
(
Ezreal
and
Caitlyn
).
Consider
investing
in
early
armor
to
mitigate
his
damage
at
early
game.
Try
to
spread
your
team
out,
to
minimize
the
damage
from
Collateral
Damage
.
Quickly
move
out
of
Graves's
Smokescreen
.
The
debuff
only
last
when
you
are
inside
the
AoE.
Also,
save
your
spells
until
outside
of
Smokescreen
as
the
vision
loss
can
lead
to
the
loss
of
your
target.
If
you
are
a
champion
that
plans
to
cast
a
supportive
ability
on
an
ally,
considering
staying
close
to
the
ally
so
that
Smokescreen
cannot
stop
you
from
seeing
them
and
thus
casting
onto
them.
Avoid
extended
skirmishes
with
Graves
as
he
gains
armor
and
magic
resistance
as
the
battle
rages
on
from
True
Grit
.
The
bonus
armor
and
magic
resist
can
change
an
expected
kill
to
a
close
call.
