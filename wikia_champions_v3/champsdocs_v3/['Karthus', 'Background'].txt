Background

Trivia
Lore
Karthus
is
a
terrible
creature
who
was
once
a
mortal
so
obsessed
with
death
that
he
eagerly
embraced
the
gift
of
undeath.
Now
in
his
unlife
as
a
lich,
Karthus
is
closer
to
his
beloved
grave
than
he
ever
imagined.
He
commands
magic
with
oblivion
as
its
source,
and
seeks
to
bring
his
grim
truth
to
the
rest
of
the
world
:
only
in
death
does
life
gain
clarity
and
purpose.
Even
as
a
boy,
Karthus
was
different.
There
was
a
darkness
within
him
that
could
not
be
denied.
The
young
child
clung
to
the
shadows
and
shunned
the
company
of
others.
He
snuck
into
the
funerals
of
strangers,
and
spoke
to
their
tombstones
in
the
cemetery.
He
sought
out
corpses
of
animals
to
preserve
and
memorialize
them,
creating
a
grim
collection
of
morbid
art.
Karthus
volunteered
to
tend
to
the
sick
and
dying,
though
his
intentions
were
not
to
help,
but
to
closely
witness
the
passing
of
those
who
were
beyond
help.
Ultimately,
he
went
so
far
as
to
elaborately
stage
his
death,
and
he
secretly
observed
his
own
funeral
with
intense
fascination.
When
others
discovered
what
Karthus
had
done,
they
were
so
shocked
and
disturbed
that,
in
a
way,
he
became
truly
dead
to
them.
Karthus
found
himself
fully
rejected
by
the
living.
His
isolation
only
served
to
fuel
his
obsession.
Karthus
delved
further
into
his
exploration
of
death,
and
became
fascinated
by
the
legends
of
the
Shadow
Isles
.
There,
it
was
said,
the
specters
of
the
deceased
continued
on
in
unlife
everlasting.
Possessed
by
these
tales,
he
knew
he
had
to
discover
for
himself
if
they
were
true.
Journeying
to
those
dreaded
isles,
Karthus
soon
found
himself
wandering
through
the
mist,
overcome
by
the
surreal
beauty
of
the
place.
He
felt
as
if
he
had
finally
come
home.
He
had
always
chased
the
elusive
purity
of
the
moment
of
death,
when
life
passed
and
in
a
single
instant
achieved
meaning.
Karthus
saw
that
undeath
was
like
that
moment,
preserved
in
dread
stillness
forever.
He
had
discovered
his
destiny,
to
cross
over
the
veil
and
leave
the
living
behind
for
eternity.
Something
awoke
in
the
Shadow
Isles
that
day,
when
Karthus
did
something
no
other
creature
had
ever
done:
he
willingly
gave
his
life
over
to
undeath.
When
he
reentered
the
world,
Karthus
had
become
the
embodiment
of
his
own
obsession.
An
undying
lich
with
the
keys
to
life
and
death,
he
seeks
to
bring
his
dark
requiem
to
the
world.
"There
is
no
sweeter
song
than
the
last
breath
of
the
dying."
―
Karthus
The
vast
quantities
of
physical
magic
that
were
consumed
and
destroyed
during
Valoran's
numerous
Rune
Wars
have
scarred
much
of
Valoran.
Many
locations
far
from
civilization
have
been
morphed
into
hazardous
and
dangerous
locales.
The
Howling
Marsh
is
one
of
these
places,
and
the
self-appointed
overlord
of
this
land
is
the
lich
known
as
Karthus.
It
is
thought
that
Karthus
was
a
mage
who,
in
life,
was
foolish
enough
to
enter
the
fetid
waters
seeking
his
fortune,
and
that
he
was
forever
transformed
by
whatever
dark
magic
permeates
the
swamp.
Karthus
now
rules
over
his
swampy
dominion
with
an
iron
(albeit
skeletal)
fist.
Visitors
are
not
welcome,
and
those
who
are
not
scared
away
by
the
lich's
terrible
power
most
likely
end
up
as
one
of
the
undead
themselves...
skeletons
and
zombies
in
Karthus'
growing
army
of
eternal
servants.
On
the
darkest
of
nights,
Karthus
is
said
to
sing
the
tales
of
those
who
have
succumbed
to
the
swamp,
past
and
present.
Karthus'
tenure
in
the
League
of
Legends
is
one
of
the
more
unusual
ones
in
the
history
of
the
League.
First,
it
is
highly
unusual
that
a
lich
who
was
known
for
isolation
and
hatred
of
life
would
even
be
a
willing
part
of
an
organization
which
promoted
the
preservation
of
life.
Next,
Karthus
specifically
eschews
the
accrual
of
power
and
influence
gained
through
service
to
the
League;
he
is
essentially
an
unpaid
volunteer.
This
behavior
is
completely
different
than
what
his
life
outside
of
the
League
would
have
onlookers
believe.
Karthus
has
never
spoken
about
his
intentions
in
being
a
champion
of
the
League,
and
in
fact
becomes
quite
agitated
when
asked
about
it.
In
the
interests
of
not
aggravating
a
lich,
most
sensible
people
subsequently
drop
the
issue.
"Come
visit
my
home,
and
I
shall
sing
a
dirge
of
your
life
as
it
once
was."
