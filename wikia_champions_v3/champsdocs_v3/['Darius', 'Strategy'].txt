Darius
Champion
Background
Strategy
Skins
&
Trivia
Skill
Usage
Darius
is
generally
a
strong
solo
top
champion
due
to
his
durability
and
harassment
ability,
and
he
can
easily
gain
lane
control
against
most
other
melee
tank/bruiser
opponents.
Decimate
is
Darius'
harassment
ability.
Strike
enemy
champions
from
maximum
range
for
the
greatest
effect.
Liberally
apply
Hemorrhage
whenever
the
opponent
is
in
range.
This
works
better
when
some
armor
is
obtained
to
negate
minion
retaliation.
Against
careless
opponents,
a
surprise
Apprehend
followed
by
Crippling
Strike
can
force
an
enemy
to
tank
some
turret
shots.
Darius
relies
largely
on
Decimate
to
deal
effective
damage
in
lane,
without
this
ability
he
is
fairly
vulnerable
to
other
champions.
Hence,
use
this
ability
sparingly
as
many
champions
can
all-in
on
you
when
you
do
not
have
your
Decimate
up.
Crippling
Strike
resets
your
autoattack
timer,
so
use
it
right
after
a
basic
attack
to
add
some
extra
damage.
This
can
be
used
for
pushing
towers.
Crippling
Strike
decreases
attack
speed,
making
a
one-versus-one
more
favorable
if
the
enemy
relies
on
attacks
and
attack
speed.
Take
into
consideration
which
champion
you
are
facing,
and
properly
utilizing
this
skill
can
help
shut
down
the
enemy.
In
addition,
this
makes
you
fairly
deadly
to
any
Ranged
Attack-Damage
Carries,
as
you
reduce
their
damage
output
by
a
large
margin.
Noxian
Guillotine
deals
more
damage
based
on
additional
Hemorrhage
stacks.
Try
to
activate
it
on
targets
with
max
stacks
to
deal
the
full
damage
of
the
ability.
You
can
combo
Decimate
->
Apprehend
->
basic
attack
->
Crippling
Strike
to
quickly
apply
3
stacks
of
Hemorrhage
in
a
very
short
time.
The
slow
will
also
allow
you
to
land
further
attacks
to
maximize
Noxian
Guillotine's
damage.
Try
to
avoid
pulling
enemies
in
with
Apprehend
and
then
using
Decimate
,
as
this
deals
less
damage.
If
possible
Decimate
first
to
deal
the
bonus
damage.
However,
if
you
activate
Apprehend
to
initiate,
you
can
then
use
Decimate
when
the
enemy
tries
to
run
out
of
your
range
in
order
to
utilise
the
bonus
damage
of
Decimate
.
This
is
especially
useful
in
the
laning
phase
for
harass.
Apprehend
is
a
strong
crowd
control
ability
in
teamfights,
but
be
careful
who
you
pull.
Pulling
tanks
such
as
Alistar
or
Amumu
might
backfire.
Apprehend
can
pull
people
and
minions
over
walls.
It
is
useful
for
separating
enemies
from
their
team
or
grabbing
blue/red
buff
from
a
safer
location.
Apprehend
is
a
strong
initiation
skill,
but
is
much
better
at
keeping
people
in
the
fight.
Build
Usage
Darius
has
strong
bonus
attack
damage
scaling,
so
building
accordingly
would
be
prudent.
Against
an
armor-heavy
team,
getting
The
Black
Cleaver
is
great.
It
gives
more
attack
damage
that
scales
with
your
abilities
and
armor
reduction
to
soften
your
targets
up.
Since
the
passive
from
Apprehend
already
gives
Darius
armor
penetration,
building
a
Last
Whisper
will
turn
Darius
into
a
potent
armor
penetrator.
The
Bloodthirster
is
a
potent,
if
expensive
way
to
solve
Darius's
lack
of
sustain,
and
benefit
his
high
AD
scaling.
Purchase
the
Vampiric
Scepter
early
to
help
Darius
in
the
laning
phase.
However,
keep
in
mind
that
Darius
is
usually
a
prime
target
during
teamfights
due
to
the
threat
of
Noxian
Guillotine
,
and
will
die
quickly
if
not
built
with
at
least
some
health
and
defensive
stats.
A
high
threat
glass
cannon
in
melee
range
will
die
most
of
the
time.
Darius
has
trouble
sticking
to
targets
without
Crippling
Strike
and
Apprehend
up,
so
an
early
Phage
would
be
helpful.
The
combination
of
the
slow
from
Crippling
Strike
and
Phage's
bonus
movement
speed
combined
with
the
movement
speed
from
Hemorrhage
will
allow
you
to
stick
to
almost
any
target.
An
alternative
to
Phage
and
Trinity
Force
is
Frozen
Mallet
,
which
synergizes
well
with
Darius
'
AD
scaling
and
his
need
for
health
items
due
to
being
melee.
The
double
slow
on
Frozen
Mallet
will
bring
most
enemies
to
a
crawl.
An
early
Hexdrinker
will
greatly
help
Darius
against
magic
damage-dealing
champions
who
can
oppose
his
solo
top
lane
control,
such
as
Rumble
.
The
resulting
upgrade
Maw
of
Malmortius
is
a
great
way
for
Darius
to
get
much-needed
magic
resistance
,
while
still
improving
his
damage.
Warden's
Mail
gives
Darius
some
early
sustain
and
the
upper
hand
against
AD-champions,
since
fighting
back
will
make
their
escape
even
harder.
It
can
later
upgrade
to
a
Frozen
Heart
for
cooldown
reduction
for
his
skills
and
even
more
armor,
making
him
tough
to
kill
and
increasing
damage
output
through
skills.
Darius
has
no
movement
abilities
or
other
escapes,
so
getting
a
Quicksilver
Sash
will
help
against
teams
that
try
to
lock
you
down
with
crowd
control.
Trinity
Force
can
be
used
to
great
effect
on
Darius
despite
the
ability
power
waste,
due
to
his
low
cooldowns
and
short
range
ability
combos,
it
becomes
easy
to
proc
Sheen
multiple
times
in
a
matter
of
seconds,
and
also
provides
some
relief
on
his
low
mana
problems.
Infinity
Edge
is
sometimes
picked
up
on
Darius
for
the
immense
DPS
it
grants.
When
combined
with
Crippling
Strike
,
it's
possible
to
hit
for
450%
of
your
attack
damage
in
a
single
strike.
Infinity
Edge
is
a
very
big
investment
for
a
bruiser
and
should
only
be
picked
up
if
you're
doing
well.
Tiamat
and
later
on
a
Ravenous
Hydra
can
give
some
good
lane
sustain,
and
can
turn
Darius
from
a
good
farmer
into
an
excellent
one
due
to
the
cleave
and
respectably
the
crescent
activated
ability;
stand
in
the
middle
of
a
group
of
minions,
use
cleave/crescent
and
then
Decimate
to
instantly
clear
a
wave.

Countering
Building
armor
to
negate
Darius
'
damage
is
not
as
recommended
as
against
other
physical
damage
dealers,
since
his
ultimate
deals
true
damage,
his
passive
deals
magic
damage
and
he
has
passive
precentile
armor
penetration.
As
such,
building
health
is
a
more
suitable
counter.
Even
though
the
damage
of
Hemorrhage
is
initially
negligible,
do
not
let
Darius
stack
it.
This
will
cause
Noxian
Guillotine
to
deal
double
damage
(if
you
have
5
stacks),
and
the
cooldown
of
his
Crippling
Strike
will
be
lower.
Thus,
from
there,
Darius
can
also
build
fairly
tanky
more
so
compared
to
other
off-tanks
of
similar
caliber,
due
to
his
naturally
high
damage
stacks;
be
very
wary
if
a
tanky
Darius
plans
to
initiate
for
his
team.
Kayle
is
an
absolute
counter
to
Darius
throughout
the
game.
In
lane,
Kayle
can
kite
Darius
with
Reckoning
,
Divine
Blessing
,
and
Righteous
Fury
.
This
allows
her
to
farm
from
a
distance,
win
trades,
harass
safely,
and
out-sustain
Darius.
Should
an
extended
fight
occur
which
leads
to
Darius
attempting
to
use
Noxian
Guillotine
,
Kayle's
Intervention
can
be
used
to
block
the
damage
from
the
skill,
and
force
Noxian
Guillotine
on
cooldown.
At
all
ranks,
Intervention
has
a
lower
cooldown
than
Noxian
Guillotine,
so
it
should
always
be
available
to
stop
Darius'
Ultimate.
Intervention
can
also
be
used
on
allies
in
teamfights
to
save
them
from
Noxian
Guillotine
,
allowing
Kayle
to
stop
Darius
cold
even
past
the
lane
phase.
Darius
has
a
high
damage
output,
but
he
lacks
any
form
of
escape
mechanism.
This
makes
Darius
very
prone
to
crowd
control
spells.
Remember
that
Darius
has
poor
sustain.
Try
to
harass
him
whenever
you
can
to
counter
him
from
zoning
you.
Darius
relies
on
his
Decimate
to
deal
effective
damage
in
lane,
it
also
has
a
moderately
high
cooldown
early
game.
Punish
him
if
he
misses
his
Decimate
.
Remember
that
towers
will
automatically
target
any
enemy
champion
who
damages
an
allied
champion
within
their
range.
This
is
important
for
countering
Darius
as
it
means
he
cannot
approach
a
tower
while
Hemorrhage
is
applied
to
a
champion
within
it's
range.
Use
this
to
escape
Darius
by
moving
near
enough
to
the
tower
to
deny
him
a
kill,
or
use
it
to
attack
Darius
via
tossing
or
pulling
him
to
the
tower.
Quicksilver
Sash
not
only
removes
hard
disables,
but
also
clears
a
wide
variety
of
debuffs.
Once
Darius
applies
five
stacks
of
Hemorrhage
and
activates
Noxian
Guillotine
,
you
can
activate
Quicksilver
Sash
while
he's
mid-cast
to
greatly
reduce
the
incoming
damage
from
the
ultimate.
This
can
potentially
turn
the
fight
in
your
favor
and
deny
Darius
the
ultimate
refresh
he
needs
to
continue
a
rampage.
Shields,
especially
high-health
shields
like
those
from
Karma's
Defiance
can
be
used
to
deny
Darius's
Noxian
Guillotine
a
finishing
blow,
setting
it
on
full
cooldown
and
drastically
reducing
Darius's
presence
in
team
fights
Keep
a
close
eye
on
low-health
allies
and/or
allies
with
lots
of
Hemorrhage
stacks,
since
those
are
likely
to
be
the
targets
of
Noxian
Guillotine
.
Shields/heals
can
be
cast
during
the
start
up
animation
of
Noxian
Guillotine
,
since
the
casting
time
is
long
enough,
and
activating
a
shield
too
early
can
result
in
Darius
simply
waiting
for
the
bonus
health
to
expire.
A
well
timed
Sivir's
Spell
Shield
and
Nocturne's
Shroud
of
Darkness
can
nullify
Darius'
Ultimate.
Darius
is
exceptionally
vulnerable
to
being
kited,
due
to
the
cooldown
and
short
range
of
Apprehend
(the
range
is
shorter
in
practice
than
the
attack
range
of
every
ranged
champion
with
the
marksman
tag),
and
his
lack
of
other
gap
closers.
Any
sort
of
champion
that
can
close
the
gap
almost
instantly
on
Darius
(for
example
Jax
or
Fiora
)
is
also
acceptable
because
of
the
fact
Decimate
deals
less
damage
inside
its
range.
Noxian
Guillotine
can't
hit
stealthed
units.
If
you
use
an
instant
stealth
spell
while
he
is
channeling
his
ult
,
Darius
will
stop
his
ultimate
mid
air,
due
to
not
having
a
target.
However,
it
will
not
go
on
cooldown,
like
all
targeted
spells
that
lose
their
targets.
Remember
that
his
range
is
short,
so
every
ability
with
long
range
can
be
used
to
harass
him.
