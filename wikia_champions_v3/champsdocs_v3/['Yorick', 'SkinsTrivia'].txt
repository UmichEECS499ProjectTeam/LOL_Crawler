Trivia
Yorick
was
designed
by
Coronach
.
Yorick's
namesake
is
from
William
Shakespeare
's
play
Hamlet
,
in
which
Yorick
is
a
deceased
court
jester
whose
skull
is
exhumed
by
a
gravedigger.
Yorick's
ability
names
are
references
to
the
Four
Horsemen
of
the
Apocalypse
.
Yorick
is
currently
being
reworked
by
Alexander
"Xelnath"
Brazie,
the
status
of
his
upcoming
kit
can
be
found
here
Yorick
is
currently
the
only
champion
removed
from
the
free
champion
rotation
Yorick
is
the
only
champion
to
have
been
removed
from
the
free
champion
rotation
but
not
the
sale
rotation
In
his
splash
art,
Yorick
stands
on
a
tomb
with
"MORI"
engraved.
Mori
is
Yorick's
family's
surname,
and
has
meanings
relating
to
death
or
dying
in
several
languages.
"
Memento
mori
"
is
a
Latin
phrase
that
was
mostly
used
in
medieval
Europe
that
means
"Remember,
thou
art
mortal".
It
is
the
most
common
phrase
that
uses
the
word
"mori".
His
quote
"You
will
remember
Yorick
Mori."
is
a
clear
reference
to
the
very
same
phrase.
Yorick
is
the
first
champion
to
be
released
before
his
champion
spotlight,
mainly
due
to
Phreak
being
delayed
on
a
flight
back
from
Dreamhack
in
Sweden.
Yorick
has
one
of
the
most
varied
skillsets
in
the
game,
with
an
auto-attack
modifier,
a
ground
targeted
AoE,
an
enemy
targeted
instant-cast
and
an
allied
targeted
instant-cast.
Among
these
are
both
controllable
and
incontrollable
pets.
Yorick
and
Shaco
are
the
only
champions
to
have
both
Automatic
and
Controllable
pets
.
Yorick
is
one
of
the
four
champions
to
have
abilities
which
allow
them
to
continue
to
attack
after
death.
Yorick's
ability
being
Omen
of
Death
and
the
others
being
Karthus's
Death
Defied
,
Kog'Maw's
Icathian
Surprise
and
Zyra's
Rise
of
the
Thorns
.
However,
Yorick
is
the
only
champion
to
have
his
ability
to
reanimate
after
death
not
be
his
passive.
Yorick's
ghost
is
temporarily
coded
as
a
champion,
so
killing
it
would
count
as
a
champion
kill.
This
only
works
however
if
the
real
champion
has
already
died.
Yorick's
job
as
a
ferryman
for
the
Shadow
Isles
's
undead
denizens
is
a
reference
to
the
Psychopomp
who
are
creatures,
spirits,
angels,
or
deities
in
many
religions
whose
responsibility
is
to
escort
newly
deceased
souls
to
the
afterlife.
Quotes
The
West
Altar's
quote
"Alas,
poor
Yorick"
is
a
reference
to
Shakespeare's
play
"Hamlet"
The
East
Altar's
quote
"Bring
out
your
dead!"
is
a
reference
to
the
corpse-carts
from
the
time
of
the
Black
Plague,
made
famous
by
Monty
Python's
film
"Monty
Python
and
the
Holy
Grail"
.
Skins
Undertaker
Yorick
is
a
reference
to
a
funeral
director
,
a
professional
in
the
business
of
funeral
rites.
Yorick
shares
a
Pentakill
theme
with
Mordekaiser
,
Karthus
,
Sona
and
Olaf
.
The
skin
itself
is
heavily
modeled
after
Slash
,
the
former
guitarist
of
Guns
N'
Roses
.
The
skin
changes
his
dance,
as
he
does
not
spin
his
weapon
during
the
dance,
but
rather
lifts
his
hand
up
and
makes
a
sign
with
his
hand
(The
same
hand
sign
the
ghoul
makes
in
his
Pentakill
splash
art).
Relations
Yorick
serves
as
a
ferryman
for
the
Shadow
Isles
's
undead
denizens,
helping
them
climb

many-tiered
ladder.
Yorick
was
first
sighted
near
a
Demacian
town
near
Bubbling
Bog
,
prior
Mordekaiser
stated
that
a
new
Pentakill
member
is
coming.

metal
band
