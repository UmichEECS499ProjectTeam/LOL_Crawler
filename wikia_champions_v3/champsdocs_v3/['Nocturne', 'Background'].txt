Lore
Before
Nocturne,
people
believed
that
dreams
were
figments
of
their
imaginations,
meaningless
images
that
flashed
through
the
mind
when
one
slept.
This
belief
was
put
to
the
test
when
a
rash
of
sleep-related
incidents
started
afflicting
summoners
of
the
League
.
Some
would
wake
up
screaming,
terrified
and
beyond
consolation.
Some
could
not
fall
asleep,
slowly
going
mad
as
the
nights
ticked
by.
Some
simply
never
woke
up.
Physicians
were
baffled
until
a
Field
Architect
happened
to
pass
out
next
to
a
nexus
on
the
Twisted
Treeline
.
Witnesses
said
he
cried
out
once
and
then
stopped
breathing.
Immediately
after,
magical
energy
arced
out
from
the
nexus,
and
Nocturne
appeared.
Nocturne
did
not
take
his
introduction
to
this
world
kindly.
He
slaughtered
everything
he
could
find
before
summoners
were
able
to
magically
confine
him.
After
a
period
of
intense
study,
League
experts
divined
that
Nocturne
hunted
summoners
in
their
sleep,
attacking
them
in
a
place
where
their
magic
was
useless.
This
seemed
to
be
his
only
purpose.
The
families
of
the
victims
demanded
justice,
but
League
officials
were
concerned
that
death
might
only
return
Nocturne
to
the
place
from
which
he
came.
They
bound
him
to
a
nexus
fragment,
trapping
him
in
the
physical
world.
As
punishment
for
his
crimes,
they
allowed
summoners
to
call
upon
Nocturne
in
League
matches,
bending
his
will
to
the
summoners
he
hates
and
creating
his
own
personal
nightmare.
League
scholars
don’t
know
whether
he
truly
came
from
the
plane
of
dreams,
or
whether
there
are
any
more
like
him.
Some
theorize
that
the
summoning
act
affected
the
summoners'
subconscious
minds,
luring
Nocturne
to
them
in
their
sleep.
Perhaps
the
most
disturbing
theory
is
that
Nocturne
is
a
person’s
nightmare
come
to
life.
If
this
is
true,
they
wonder,
who
is
the
dreamer?
“The
darkness
is
closing
in...
it’s
pitch
black
now...
but
I
can
still
see
him...”
―
Kelvin
Ma,
patient

CLE
OBSERVATION
The
Field
Architect
has
had
a
long
day.
Surveying
the
grounds
for
signs
of
degradation
is
no
small
task;
taking
readings
every
five
feet
is
essential
in
order
to
detect
even
the
slightest
disturbances
in
the
intricate
energy
fields.
An
overlooked
spike
in
the
surrounding
forces
could
set
off
a
chain
reaction
of
destruction
due
to
the
rampant
use
of
magic
on
the
Fields
of
Justice.
In
his
own
little
way,
he
liked
to
think
that
he
was
saving
Runeterra
one
checkpoint
at
a
time.
His
work
complete,
the
architect
makes
his
way
back
to
the
summoning
platform,
where
he
passes
a
nexus
that
should
have
been
dormant.
An
unbidden
spark
inside
the
nexus
catches
his
eye.
He
turns
to
investigate
only
to
be
struck
by
a
wild
burst
of
energy
arcing
out
of
the
nexus.
The
architect
collapses
to
the
floor
in
a
heap,
sprawling
on
the
unforgiving
cobblestone.
His
body
shrivels
as
a
noxious
trail
of
thick
smoke
pours
out
of
his
open
mouth.
It
is
shivering
with
life
and
pulsing
with
horrors.
It
is
born
of
nightmares.
REFLECTION
Nocturne
had
drifted
through
the
minds
of
humans
for
endless
expanses
of
time.
He
beheld
the
faces
they
yearned
for,
absorbed
the
desires
that
coursed
through
their
veins,
and
inhabited
the
fantasies
that
set
their
hearts
ablaze.
He
lingered
within
the
despicably
human
illusions
they
conjured
in
the
narrow
expanse
that
was
their
puny
brains.
From
all
of
them,
he
consumed
the
magic
that
rippled
through
their
souls.
Nocturne
had
only
a
moment
to
examine
his
new
found
physical
form
before
a
circle
of
robed
summoners
appeared
around
him.
He
knew
who
they
were
before
they
even
revealed
themselves.
These
were
the
overlords
whose
faces
consumed
each
mind
of
every
summoner
whose
dreams
he
haunted.
They
were
the
voices
that
drenched
lesser
kinds
with
promises
of
great
power,
and
they
were
the
hands
that
directed
the
ebb
and
flow
of
the
entire
world.
Nocturne
knew
what
these
humans
wanted,
but
they
would
not
get
him.
His
shadowed
form
ghosted
silently
toward
one
of
the
humans,
reaching
out
with
the
ethereal
tendrils
of
his
consciousness.
The
cloaked
human
spasmed
as
his
hands
rose
to
tear
at
his
own
head.
A
bloodcurdling
scream
ripped
through
the
air,
then
choked
off
into
silence
as
the
human's
mind
collapsed
into
itself.
The
other
humans
barely
had
a
chance
to
react
before
Nocturne
was
on
them.
He
reached
out
with
his
limbs
as
twin
blades
extended
forth
from
his
arms
to
rend
human
flesh
from
bone.
The
shadow
darted
low
and
slashed
upwards
with
his
blades,
impaling
an
unfortunate
summoner
through
the
entire
length
of
his
body.
Nocturne
felt
a
group
of
humans
rush
up
from
behind;
for
a
second,
his
form
pulsed.
Darkness
smothered
the
entire
field,
an
oppressive
blackness
that
breathed
and
sighed.
Victims
eternally
trapped
in
the
phantasm
murmured
in
the
summoners'
ears,
promising
eternal
torment
and
pleading
for
release.
Disembodied
hands
clawed
at
the
living,
desperate
to
rip
any
semblance
of
existence
away
for
their
own
keeping.
The
remaining
summoners
lashed
out,
flailing
against
the
ghastly
fingers
that
only
disappeared
long
enough
to
reappear
again
in
greater
numbers.
Spell
incantations
decayed
on
their
lips
as
the
magical
energies
refused
to
heed
their
call.
The
darkness
began
to
suffocate
the
humans,
and
they
clawed
at
their
eyes
in
a
wild
attempt
to
regain
their
sight.
Devoured
by
terror,
they
didn't
even
sense
Nocturne's
approach,
nor
did
they
feel
the
blades
that
cleaved
through
their
soft
bodies
and
condemned
their
souls
to
an
eternity
in
the
darkness.
One
summoner
had
stood
apart
from
the
others.
He
was
decorated
with
gold
chains
draped
over
purple
robes.
Unaffected
by
the
blindness
and
horrors,
he
had
chosen
to
observe
impassively
as
the
carnage
unfurled.
No
expression
flickered
over
his
face
as
the
pooled
blood
stained
the
hem
of
his
robes,
nor
did
his
visage
change
when
the
dismembered
head
of
his
former
comrade
bumped
up
against
his
leg.
The
summoner
spoke.
"Impressive.
I
see
that
the
eons
you've
spent
leeching
off
of
our
minds
have
managed
to
serve
some
purpose."
"I
know
who
you
are."
Nocturne
returned.
"I'm
flattered."
The
summoner
sneered.
"Then
you
should
also
know
that
it
is
time
you
repay
us
for
the
horrors
you
have
wrought
upon
our
kind."
"And
how
do
you
plan
to
do
that,
human?"
A
monstrous
howl
echoed
from
the
shadows,
something
akin
to
what
those
humans
called
a
laugh.
"You
are
now
in
the
world
of
our
control.
And
you
shall
be
in
our
service."
"You
call
this
pitiful
existence
'payment'?"
A
flick
of
Nocturne's
hideous
blade
sent
a
pile
of
steaming
entrails
splattering
across
the
ground.
He
readied
the
jagged
edge
for
this
last
foolish
one.
"You
may
have
conjured
me
into
your
world
somehow,
but
all
you
will
receive
is
destruction."
With
a
roar,
Nocturne
heaved
himself
at
the
summoner.
His
blood-soaked
blade
came
within
a
razor's
width
of
carving
that
aggravating
smirk
off
the
human's
face.
Metal
circled
around
his
wrists,
clanging
shut,
and
sent
him
flying
backwards
into
a
heap
of
metal
chains.
"No.
This
is
your
reparation."
The
summoner's
lips
parted,
wet
with
anticipation.
"Welcome
to
the
League."
The
summoners
whose
bodies
lay
in
a
pile
around
him
raised
their
heads.
Their
arms
shot
out
and
clamped
onto
Nocturne
with
an
iron
grip.
They
dragged
him
downward,
forcing
his
physical
existence
into
submission.
Every
part
of
him
screamed
out
against
the
shackles
as
he
involuntarily
bowed
to
the
towering
head
summoner.
Nocturne
was
now
in
service
to
the
League,
and
it
was
his
own
eternal
nightmare.

Sneak
Peek
Have
you
ever
taken
in
a
horror
film
only
to
go
to
bed
with
your
eyes
wide
open
on
the
lookout
for
things
that
go
thump
in
the
night?
Well
while
we’re
on
the
topic
of
things
akin
to
ghosts,
goblins,
phantoms,
specters,
apparitions,
poltergeists
and
very
possibly
the
boogieman,
allow
me
to
be
the
first
to
introduce
you
to
Nocturne,
the
Eternal
Nightmare.
But
don’t
worry!
While
he
might
feature
prominently
in
the
next
thriller
you
decide
to
take
in,
you
probably
won’t
find
him
hiding
under
your
bed
or
in
your
closet.
Or
will
you?!
Don’t
be
paranoid!
