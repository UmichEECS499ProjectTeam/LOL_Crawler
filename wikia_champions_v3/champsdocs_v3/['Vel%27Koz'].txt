Upon
hitting
an
enemy,
reaching
maximum
range
or
being
reactivated,
the
bolt
splits
in
two:
each
traveling
in
opposite
directions
perpendicular
to
the
direction
of
cast.
Each
of
the
secondary
bolts
deal
magic
damage
and
slow
the
first
enemies
they
hit,
respectively.
Ability
Details
Plasma
Fission
is
a
linear,
colliding
skill
shot
that
splits
into
two
additional
linear,
colliding
skill
shots
upon
detonation.
Applies
spell
effects
as
an
area
of
effect
ability.
Spell
vamp
is
reduced
to
one-third
effectiveness.
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
will
apply
a
15%
slow.
Magic
damage
will
be
mitigated
by
Black
Shield
and
Lifeline
.
Spell
shields
will
block
the
ability,
but
will
not
prevent
the
split.
Additional
Information:
An
enemy
cannot
be
hit
multiple
bolts.
If
blocked
by
a
spell
shield,
you
still
count
as
having
been
hit
and
cannot
be
hit
again.
There
is
a
short
delay
before
the
ability
can
be
reactivated.
While
primarily
to
prevent
accidentally
detonations,
it
adds
a
minimum
distance
travelled
of
approximately
500
units.
1050
is
the
maximum
distance
that
each
bolt
can
travel.
Factoring
the
split,
Plasma
fission
can
hit
targets
up
to
1485
units
away.
