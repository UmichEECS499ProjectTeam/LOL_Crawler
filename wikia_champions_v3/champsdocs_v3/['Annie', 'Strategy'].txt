Skill
usage
During
the
laning
phase,
try
to
find
a
good
balance
between
storing
your
stun
for
use
and
continuing
to
use
your
spells
to
maintain
a
strong
farming
game.
A
good
tactic
at
the
start
of
a
game
is
to
use
Incinerate
4
times
to
get
a
stun
ready
before
you
leave
the
fountain.
This
can
help
turn
the
tide
of
a
first
battle,
and
aid
you
in
getting
first
blood.
Sometimes
it
is
smarter
to
approach
an
enemy
with
3
Pyromania
charges
instead
of
4
to
appear
vulnerable.
You
can
then
quickly
charge
the
stun
with
Molten
Shield
.
It
can
also
allow
you
to
break
Banshee's
Veil
with
a
weaker
spell
before
using
a
spell
(especially
Summon:
Tibbers
)
that
stuns
them.
This
can
also
be
an
effective
strategy
to
lure
enemies
into
a
false
sense
of
security.
During
the
laning
phase,
use
Disintegrate
to
last
hit
minions
since
it
refunds
its
mana
cost
when
it
kills
a
unit.
Use
this
to
quickly
stack
Pyromania
.
Disintegrate
can
be
used
once
Pyromania
is
available
to
lock
down
a
single
target,
as
it
is
a
targeted
ability,
saving
more
powerful
abilities
for
follow
up.
While
Incinerate
can
take
down
groups
of
low
health
minions
early
game,
positioning
the
cone
so
that
it
also
routinely
damages
the
enemy
champion
can
be
very
useful.
Dropping
their
health
like
this
can
be
followed
up
with
a
big
Summon:
Tibbers
+
Pyromania
burst
for
the
kill.
Don't
rely
on
Molten
Shield
to
keep
you
alive.
Its
damage
isn't
great
for
countering
AD
carries
with
life
steal
,
and
early
game
its
defensive
properties
are
minimal
at
best.
It
is
mainly
used
to
charge
up
a
combo.
When
you
have
3
Pyromania
charges
you
can
cast
Molten
Shield
while
Disintegrate
is
in
mid-flight
to
prime
the
stun
and
land
it
when
your
Q
hits.
Annie's
Summon:
Tibbers
can
be
controlled,
like
most
pet
units,
by
holding
Alt
or
activating
the
ability
again
before
moving.
Summon:
Tibbers
or
Incinerate
used
in
combination
with
Pyromania
results
in
Annie
having
an
AoE
stun
effect.
Incinerate
can
be
used
as
an
AoE
stun
in
replacement
of
Summon:
Tibbers
,
guaranteeing
Tibbers
to
land
and
damage
all
the
intended
targets.
Build
usage
Disintegrate
can
quickly
build
up
mana
in
items
like
Tear
of
the
Goddess
or
Archangel's
Staff
.
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
is
a
great
item
for
Annie
,
as
the
health
and
area
of
effect
slow
allows
Tibbers'
AoE
damage
aura
to
constantly
apply
the
slow
debuff,
making
Tibbers
excellent
for
chasing
and
kiting.
Rabadon's
Deathcap
is
a
must
for
Annie
like
with
any
burst
mage
that
needs
high
AP.
Abyssal
Scepter
is
a
good
option
for
Annie
when
the
enemy
team
has
lots
of
magic
damage.
It
provides
magic
resistance,
but
still
contributes
to
her
burst
potential
with
AP
and
a
magic
resistance
reduction
aura
and
since
none
of
her
abilities
exceed
the
700
range,
she
can
capitalize
the
aura
to
its
full
potential.
Captain
enchantment
and
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
can
be
used
to
make
Tibbers
very
difficult
to
escape
(Tibbers
movespeed
will
be
420).
Deathfire
Grasp
can
be
an
excellent
choice
for
Annie
given
her
potential
to
kill
targets
in
a
single
rotation.
The
20%
increased
Magic
Damage
from
"Doom"
debuff
can
help
Summon:
Tibbers
's
aura
and
benefit
other
teammates
that
deal
primarily
Magic
Damage.
The
cool
down
reduction
is
a
nice
bonus
as
well.

Countering
All
of
Annie's
spells
deal
magic
damage,
therefore
any
form
of
magic
resistance
will
mitigate
her
damage
significantly.
Banshee's
Veil
offers
a
spell
shield
to
negate
1
spell
from
Annie
.
Its
magic
resistance
and
health
will
help
tremendously
in
surviving
Annie's
burst,
while
also
usually
blocking
Annie's
opener,
which
is
typically
a
stun.
Quicksilver
Sash
is
a
cheaper
alternative,
and
allows
you
to
block
her
stun
specifically,
instead
of
just
one
ability.
Do
not
underestimate
the
damaging
aura
from
Annie's
Summon:
Tibbers
.
The
longer
the
fight
lasts,
the
more
damage
you
will
take
from
it.
Avoid
focusing
her
Tibbers
when
attacking
Annie
.
Tibbers
has
a
lot
of
health
and
damage,
and
killing
Annie
kills
Tibbers
as
well.
Focusing
Tibbers
allows
Annie
to
finish
you
off
with
her
spells
if
she
is
ignored.
Do
not
disregard
Tibbers
completely,
however.
Its
attack
damage
and
damaging
aura
can
easily
put
a
tense
fight
against
Annie
in
her
favor
if
left
to
attack
you.
Alternatively,
use
ranged
attacks
and
abilities
to
kill
Tibbers
while
keeping
out
of
range
of
Annie's
spells,
the
advantage
to
this
being
that
Tibbers
will
most
likely
be
easier
to
kill.
Tibbers
is
considered
a
minion
therefore
Smite
and
champion
abilities
that
work
on
minions
and
monsters
only
(such
as
Syndra's
Force
of
Will
Nunu's
Consume
),
will
work
on
him
as
well.
A
Cho'Gath
that
uses
Smite
and
Feast
can
kill
Tibbers
immediately,
and
gain
a
stack
of
health.
Be
alert
for
the
visual
effect
that
appears
when
the
stun
from
Pyromania
is
ready.
Because
Disintegrate
refunds
mana
when
used
to
last
hit
minions,
be
cautious
around
an
Annie
using
autoattacks
on
minions.
She
is
likely
to
have
3
stacks
on
Pyromania
and
is
waiting
for
someone
to
engage
her.
She
will
cast
Molten
Shield
,
allowing
her
to
stun
on
her
next
spell.
Molten
Shield
acts
like
a
Thornmail
.
Be
careful
when
engaging
her
if
you
are
using
a
champion
that
relies
on
auto-attack.
It
can
sometimes
be
hard
to
see
the
visual
effect
of
Pyromania
if
she
has
her
Molten
Shield
up.
