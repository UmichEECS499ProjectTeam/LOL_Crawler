Lore
Yasuo
is
a
man
of
resolve,
an
agile
swordsman
who
wields
the
wind
itself
to
cut
down
his
foes.
But
this
once
proud
warrior
has
been
disgraced
by
a
false
accusation
and
forced
into
a
desperate
fight
for
survival.
With
the
world
turned
against
him,
he
will
do
everything
in
his
power
to
bring
the
guilty
to
justice
and
restore
his
honor.
Once
a
brilliant
pupil
at
a
renowned
Ionian
sword
school,
Yasuo
was
the
only
student
in
a
generation
to
master
the
legendary
wind
technique.
Many
believed
he
was
destined
to
become
a
great
hero.
However,
his
fate
was
changed
forever
when
Noxus
invaded.
Yasuo
was
charged
with
guarding
an
Ionian
Elder,
but,
foolishly
believing
his
blade
alone
could
make
the
difference,
left
his
post
to
join
the
fray.
By
the
time
he
returned,
the
Elder
had
been
slain.
Disgraced,
Yasuo
willingly
turned
himself
in,
prepared
to
pay
for
his
failure
with
his
life.
He
was
shocked,
however,
to
find
himself
accused
not
just
of
dereliction,
but
of
the
murder
itself.
Though
confused
and
racked
with
guilt,
he
knew
the
assassin
would
go
unpunished
if
he
did
not
act.
Yasuo
raised
his
sword
against
the
school
and
fought
his
way
free,
knowing
his
treason
would
turn
all
of
Ionia
against
him.
Now
truly
alone
for
the
first
time
in
his
life,
he
set
out
to
find
the
Elder's
real
killer.
Yasuo
spent
the
next
several
years
wandering
the
land,
seeking
any
clue
that
might
lead
him
to
the
murderer.
All
the
while,
he
was
relentlessly
hunted
by
his
former
allies,
continually
forced
to
fight
or
die.
His
mission
drove
him
ever
forward,
until
he
was
tracked
down
by
the
one
foe
he
dreaded
most
–
his
own
brother,
Yone.
Bound
by
a
common
code
of
honor,
the
two
warriors
bowed
and
drew
their
swords.
Silently
they
circled
one
another
under
the
moonlight.
When
they
finally
charged
forward,
Yone
was
no
match
for
Yasuo;
with
a
single
flash
of
steel
he
cut
his
brother
down.
Yasuo
dropped
his
weapon
and
rushed
to
Yone's
side.
Overcome
with
emotion,
he
demanded
to
know
how
his
own
kin
could
think
him
guilty.
Yone
spoke:
“The
Elder
was
killed
by
a
wind
technique.
Who
else
could
it
be?”
Understanding
swept
over
Yasuo
as
he
suddenly
realized
why
he
had
been
accused.
He
professed
his
innocence
once
more
and
begged
his
brother's
forgiveness.
Tears
streamed
down
Yasuo's
face
as
his
brother
passed
in
his
arms.
Yasuo
buried
Yone
under
the
rising
sun,
but
could
take
no
time
to
mourn.
Others
would
be
after
him
before
long.
His
brother's
revelation
had
given
Yasuo
newfound
purpose;
he
now
had
the
clue
that
would
lead
to
the
true
killer.
Swearing
an
oath,
he
gathered
his
belongings
and,
with
one
last
look
at
Yone's
grave,
set
out
with
the
wind
at
his
back.
The
story
of
a
sword
is
inked
in
blood.

Reveal
A
Sword
Without
a
Sheath
[1]
What
is
a
sword
without
the
man
behind
it?
Teaching
a
swordsman
to
kill
is
simple.
The
true
challenge
lies
in
teaching
him
not
to
kill.
When
I
watched
my
young
brother
Yasuo
begin
training,
he
breathed
life
into
the
blade
at
first
touch.
One
heard
whispers
in
the
halls
comparing
him
to
the
sword
masters
of
old.
But
as
he
grew
and
his
skills
increased,
so
did
his
ego.
He
was
impetuous
and
boastful;
he
ignored
our
master's
lessons
and
knew
nothing
of
patience.
Fearing
my
brother
had
strayed
too
far
from
the
way,
I
went
not
to
warn
him,
but
to
make
an
appeal
to
his
honor.
I
gave
him
a
maple
seed,
our
school's
highest
lesson
in
humility
one
Yasuo
seemed
to
have
forgotten.
A
seed
is
just
a
seed,
but
given
time
one
may
come
to
know
the
beauty
it
holds
within.
Yasuo
took
my
gift,
and
the
following
day
he
accepted
a
modest
guard
post.
I
had
high
hopes
he
would
learn
the
patience
and
virtue
required
of
a
true
swordsman.
It
was
not
to
be.
Today,
Yasuo
committed
an
act
of
treason
by
murdering
the
very
person
he
was
sworn
to
protect.
He
has
betrayed
his
nation,
his
friends,
and
himself.
Were
it
not
for
my
actions,
I
wonder
if
he
would
have
been
swept
down
this
dark
path.
But
my
task
is
not
to
question;
I
must
bear
the
burden
of
my
duty.
At
first
light
tomorrow,
I
set
out
to
capture
a
sword
without
a
sheath:
my
brother
Yasuo.

Road

Ruin
Delve
into
Yasuo's
past
and

how
he
became
known
as
the
Unforgiven.
[2]
When
I
was
a
child,
my
brother
asked
me:
does
the
wind
flee,
or
does
it
follow?
For
a
long
time,
I
chose
to
run,
for
death
followed
at
my
back.
The
people
hunting
me
once
called
me
their
friend.
Now,
when
they
draw
their
blades,
they
call
me
“murderer.”
One
by
one,
they
find
me.
The
first
was
a
swordsman
of
strength
renowned
throughout
Ionia.
When
we
were
young,
I
saw
him
cleave
a
tree
in
two
with
a
single
swing
of
his
blade.
But
he
could
not
cleave
the
wind.
The
second
was
a
warrior
of
speed
and
grace.
Agile
and
cunning,
she
outran
the
clever
foxes
in
the
woods.
But
she
could
not
outrun
the
wind.
The
third
was
a
man
of
compassion.
He
taught
me
the
meaning
of
patience
when
I
was
just
a
prideful
child.
My
guide.
My
friend.
MY
BROTHER.
How
long
can
I
keep
going?
Even
the
strongest
wind
eventually
dies.
But
until
then,
I
will
not
flee.
I
will
follow
the
truth.
Let
the
wind
guide
my
blade
and
lead
me
to
the
true
murderer
–
the
one
responsible
for
the
blood
on
my
hands.
