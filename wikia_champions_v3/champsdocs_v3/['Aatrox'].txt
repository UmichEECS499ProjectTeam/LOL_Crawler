Aatrox,
the
Darkin
Blade
is
a
champion
in
League
of
Legends
.

Abilities
Aatrox's
secondary
resource
bar
displays
his
Blood
Well.
Whenever
he
uses
an
ability
that
costs
health,
he
stores
100%
of
the
health
cost
into
it.
The
Blood
Well
can
store
up
to
30
+
(45
×
level)
health.
If
Aatrox
has
not
dealt
nor
received
damage
in
the
last
5
seconds,
his
Blood
Well
will
deplete
at
a
rate
of
2%
per
second.

Upon
taking
fatal
damage,
Blood
Well
activates
and
places
Aatrox
in
stasis
for
up
to
3
seconds.
Over
the
stasis
duration
the
Blood
Well
is
emptied
and
Aatrox
restores
health
equal
to
its
contents
plus

Aatrox
can
cancel
the
stasis
early
after
1
second
by
moving,
but
this
also
ends
the
health
regeneration.
Ability
Details
Blood
Well
is
both
a
self-targeted
buff
and
a
passive
ability
that
triggers
when
Aatrox's
takes
lethal
damage.

Information:

by
Blood
Well
is

The
color
of
the
bar
is
red
when
the
revive
is
available.
On
cooldown,
it
is
white.
The
health
restoration
is
affected
by
Spirit
Visage's
passive.
Guardian
Angel
and
Chrono
Shift
will
take
precedence
over
Blood
Well.
Aatrox
is
cleansed
of
all
debuffs
when
he
enters
stasis.
Leashes,
such
as
Morgana's
Soul

Ability
Details
Dark
Flight
is
a
ground
targeted
dash
that
knocks
up
and
damages
in
a
circular
area
of
effect
.
Applies
spell
effects
as
an
area
of
effect
ability.
Spell
vamp
is
reduced
to
one-third
effectiveness.
Rylai's
Crystal
Scepter
will
apply
a
15%
slow.
Spell
shields
will
block
the
ability.
Additional
Information:
Dark
Flight
is
often
referred
to
as
a
"jump"
ability.
However,
this
does
not
represent
an
in-game
mechanic
and
it
is
merely
a
description
of
the
animation.
Despite
its
animation
and
name,
Dark
Flight
is
still
classified
as
a
dash
and
Aatrox
will
still
interact
with
skill
shots
and
area
of
effects
as
if
he
were
on
the
ground.
Dark
Flight
can
be
interrupted
by
knocking
up
or
killing
Aatrox
while
during
the
animation.
If
Aatrox
is
affected
by
other
forms
of
crowd
control
while
the
animation
is
in
progress,
the
crowd
control
effect
will
not
take
place
until
the
animation
finishes.
Dark
Flight
does
not
cancel
other
commands.
Aatrox
will
immediately
begin
attacking
after
he
lands.
With
smartcast
on,
Dark
Flight
will
be
cast
immediately
and
at
650
range
if
the
cursor
is
beyond
that.

Details
Blood
Thirst/Blood
Price
is
an
on-hit
effect
that
triggers
on
every
third
attack.
The
triggering
attack
will
apply
other
on-hit
effects
and
can
critically
strike
as
normal.
Unlike
most
other
on-hit
physical
damage,
Blood
Price's
bonus
damage
does
not
apply
life
steal
.
This
is
a
special
case,
perhaps
to
prevent
abuse
or
for
flavor.
The
triggering
attack
will
still
apply
life
steal.
Critical
strikes
do
not
interact
with
the
bonus
damage
of
Blood
Price.
Blood
Price's
bonus
damage
is
still
applied
if
the
attack
is
dodged
.
PENDING
FOR
TEST
Blood
Thirst/Blood
Price's
relationship
with
parry
and
block
has
yet
to
be
tested.
Blind
will
block
Blood
Thirst
and
Blood
Price.
Spell
shields
will
not
block
Blood
Price.
Additional
Information:
Toggling
between
Blood
Thirst
and
Blood
Price
does
not
reset
the
attack
timer.
Attacks
against
structures
will
not
increment
the
counter
or
consume
the
empowered
attack.
Toggled
abilities
do
not
count
as
ability
activations
for
the
purposes
of
effects
such
as
Spellblade
or
Force
Pulse
.
