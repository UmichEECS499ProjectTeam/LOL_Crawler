Trivia
Quinn
and
Valor
were
designed
by
Michael
'IronStylus'
Maurino
,
David
'Volty'
Abecassis
and
Runaan.
Quinn
is
the
first
champion
in
League
of
Legends
to
have
a
name
starting
with
the
letter
"Q"
.
Before
the
introduction
of
Quinn,
"Q"
was
the
only
unused
letter
in
champion
names,
meaning
that
Quinn
completes
the
alphabet
of
champion
names.
Quinn's
eagle
is
named
"Valor".
[1]
Valor's
nickname
is
"Val".
Valor
is
the
only
pet
to
actually
replace
the
champion
on
battlefield
instead
of
fighting
alongside
them
(such
as
Willump
and
Bristle
)
or
summoned
to
assist
for
a
short
duration
(such
as
Tibbers
and
Voidlings
).
Quinn
and
Valor
have
separate
champion
portraits.
This
affects
things
such
as
the
minimap
and
kill
callouts.
They
are
the
first
champion
to
have
this
feature.
However,
their
name
in
chat
and
on
the
scoreboard
remains
"Quinn".
Quinn
and
Teemo
are
the
only
champions
with
a
blinding
ability.
Quinn's
in
game
name
was
going
to
originally
be,
"Quinn
and
Valor",
but
was
shortened
to
just
"Quinn"
due
to
name-length
issues.
Quinn's
dance
is
from
Aaliyah's
music
video
"Are
You
That
Somebody?".
A
side-by-side
comparison
can
be
seen
here
.
Quinn's
auto
attack
particle
is
an
arrow
fletched
with
blue
feathers,
while
an
auto
attack
on
a
vulnerable
target
features
three
arrows
fletched
with
feathers
of
a
much
lighter
blue.
A
comparison
can
be
seen
here
.
Although
her
main
weapon
is
the
crossbow,
none
of
her
active
abilities
actually
involve
her
using
it.
Skystrike
does,
however,
use
the
crossbow,
but
this
is
not
actually
her
ability,
but
Valor's
.
Before
Quinn's
release,
there
were
teaser
journal
entries
produced
by
Riot
that
explained
some
of
Quinn's
background
[2]
.
A
similar
pre-release
series
of
pages
were
created
for
Zac
.
Skins
Phoenix
Quinn
is
a
reference
to
the
traditional
phoenix
,
a
mythical,
immortal
bird.
Quotes
Quinn's
quote,
"We
Demacians
are
no
easy
prey,"
is
similar
to
the
quote,
"We
Elves
are
not
easy
prey,"
by
Sylvanas
Windrunner
,
a
High
Elf
ranger
from
the
Warcraft
franchise.
Relations
Quinn
had
a
brother
named
Caleb
who
died
in
a
tragic
accident.
Quinn
indicates
that
she
has
some
insight
on
Talon's
assassination
style.
According
to
the
League
of
Legends
website,
Quinn
and
Talon
are
also
rivals.
Quinn
wrote
that
Jarvan
IV
was
"not
what
she
expected"
after
first
meeting
him.
RiotRansom
thinks
that
Quinn
and
Jarvan
IV
are
definitely
a
couple
(remember
that
this
is
an
opinion
and
not
canon)
[2]
.
Quinn
wrote
that
Garen
was
"by
the
books"
after
first
meeting
him.
Valor
does
not
respect
Garen.
Quinn
met
with
Ashe
while
on
a
scouting
expedition
into
Freljord
.
She
found
Ashe
to
be
diplomatic
and
welcoming,
carrying
herself
with
the
air
of
a
leader
that
shines
through
her
youth.
Valor
likes
Ashe,
which
is
rare.
Quinn
first
met
Lissandra
in
the
Frostguard
city
and
has
her
suspicions
about
Lissandra.
They
later
crossed
paths
again,
but
this
time,
she
took
her
true
form
without
Quinn's
knowledge.
