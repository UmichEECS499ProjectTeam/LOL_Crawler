Fiddlesticks
Champion
Background
Strategy
Skins
&
Trivia
For
nearly
twenty
years,
Fiddlesticks
has
stood
alone
in
the
easternmost
summoning
chamber
of
the
Institute
of
War
.
Only
the
burning
emerald
light
of
his
unearthly
gaze
pierces
the
musty
darkness
of
his
dust-covered
home.
It
is
here
that
the
Harbinger
of
Doom
keeps
a
silent
vigil.
His
is
a
cautionary
tale
of
power
run
amok,
taught
to
all
summoners
within
the
League
.
Decades
ago,
there
existed
a
powerful
rune
mage
from
Zaun
-
Istvaan.
At
the
end
of
the
fifth
Rune
War,
he
became
one
of
the
League's
first
summoners.
Too
much
a
prisoner
to
the
old
ways
of
magic,
Istvaan
stepped
further
and
further
outside
the
rules
of
conduct
in
the
League.
In
what
was
ultimately
his
last
match,
his
reach
finally
exceeded
his
grasp.
Sealing
himself
inside
the
easternmost
summoning
chamber,
he
began
incanting
the
most
forbidden
of
rituals
-
an
extra-planar
summoning.
What
exactly
happened
inside
that
chamber
remains
unknown.
No
champion
came
to
represent
Zaun
that
day
in
Summoner's
Rift
.
Only
silence
echoed
back
from
repeated
knocks
on
the
chamber
door.
The
first
apprentice
who
entered
was
cut
down
immediately
by
an
unearthly
scythe.
What
few
who
followed
and
survived
were
driven
mad
by
fear,
mere
husks
of
men
gibbering
about
crows
and
death.
Afraid
of
the
evil
even
Istvaan
could
not
control,
the
League
sealed
all
exits
to
the
chamber,
hoping
they
could
contain
what
they
could
not
destroy.
Years
went
by,
but
the
wooden
figure
within
never
moved
save
to
slay
any
foolish
enough
to
enter.
Seeing
no
recourse
to
reclaim
the
chamber,
the
Council
instead
devised
a
use
for
Fiddlesticks:
executioner.
While
he
comes
to
life
and
seemingly
abides
by
the
rules
of
summoning
in
the
Fields
of
Justice
,
what
he
awaits
inside
his
chamber
is
unknown.
His
unmoving
face
yields
no
clues,
and
his
scythe
stands
ready
to
strike
down
any
who
stand
before
him.
"
Those
who
say
'you
have
nothing
to
fear
but
fear
itself'
have
not
yet
felt
the
crows.
"
There
is
a
valley,
just
on
the
sandy
edge
of
the
Tempest
Flats.
It
is
said
that
a
powerful
witch
lives
there
at
the
very
bottom—all
by
herself,
but
never
alone.
It
is
said
that
she
commands
the
powerful
magics
that
circle
and
batter
this
place.
She
transforms
the
energies
into
semi-living
souls,
trapping
them
inside
bodies
of
carefully
crafted
scarecrows.
The
witch
has
kept
to
herself
for
many
long
years.
That
is,
until
a
few
months
ago,
when
she
sent
one
of
her
creations
out
to
warn
the
rest
of
the
world.
Leaving
the
valley
in
the
middle
of
the
night,
Fiddlesticks
shambled
across
the
desert
and
into
the
neighboring
realms.
He
torments
and
terrifies
all
who
look
upon
him
with
his
wickedly
crooked
smile.
For
he
is
the
Harbinger,
bearing
news
of
impending
doom.

in
his
enemies,
causing
them
to

On
a
day
just
like
this
one,
two
years
ago,
a
group
of
around
50
developers
got
together
and
launched
a
game
that
would
grow
into
a
phenomenon:
League

That's
right,

of
Justice

And
so
today,

celebrate
this
milestone,
we're
throwing
a

And
who
better
to
help
us
get
the
