Lissandra
Lissandra
was
designed
by
Meddler
.
[3]
Lissandra
is
the
very
last
living
Iceborn
,
an
extinct
(well
almost)
race
of
powerful
humanoids
with
several
magical
abilities.
Lissandra's
appearance
is
similar
to
that
of
Elesh
Norn
,
Grand
Cenobite
of
Magic:
The
Gathering
.
[4]
Lissandra
does
not
use
her
name
within
the
League
in-story.
To
keep
her
cover
as
Lissandra
in
Freljord
she
is
only
listed
as
"The
Ice
Witch"
in
the
League.
[5]
The
Ice
Witch's
original
name
is
Lissandra.
When
taking
over
Queen
Mauvole
she
named
her
successor
Lissandra
so
when
the
Ice
Witch
took
her
identity
she
reclaimed
her
own
name.
[6]
Lissandra's
lore
resembles
Ultimecia's
story
from
Final
Fantasy
VIII
where
she
possesses
different
sorceresses
from
different
time
periods,
deceiving
people
to
achieve
her
goal
of
ruling
the
world
in
all
time
periods.
Her
Ice
Shard
skill
resembles
sorceress
Edea's
Ice
Strike.
Lissandra's
character
shares
a
lot
of
similarities
with
Akasha
from
Unreal
Tournament
III
,
including
their
eternal
life,
accent,
quotes,
and
ambitions
to
destroy
the
world.
Lissandra
also
slightly
resembles
Flemeth
from
Dragon
Age,
while
Flemeth
possesses
and
takes
over
her
"daughter"
Lissandra
steals
her
successors'
identity
much
like
Flemeth
with
her
daughters.
There's
an
event
between
Ashe
,
Sejuani
,
and
Lissandra
that
is
similar
to
"
The
Hunt
is
On!
",
called,
"
Battle
for
Freljord
".
This
makes
it
a
2nd
event
to
happen
in-game
but
not
directly
to
the
lore.
Lissandra
is,
along
with
Caitlyn
,
Rumble
,
Varus
,
Vi
,
Xerath
,
and
Ziggs
,
one
of
the
few
champions
that
can
CC
themselves.
Lissandra
is
the
second
champion
to
feature
a
monologue
on
her
login
screen,
the
first
being
Elise
,
the
third
being
Lucian
and
the
fourth
being
Yasuo
.
If
you
win
a
match
in
the
Howling
Abyss,
30
seconds
later
you
will
hear
a
monologue
by
Lissandra
talking
about
the
Frozen
Watchers,
Serylda
and
Avarosa.
Lissandra
is
blind
in
the
sense
that
her
eyes
do
not
work,
mauled
by
an
ursine
prior
to
becoming
Iceborn.
[7]
However,
she
is
capable
of
sensing
her
surroundings
through
ice
in
a
similar
fashion
to
Toph
from
Avatar
the
Last
Airbender
.
Prior
to
losing
her
sight,
Lissandra
was
an
adventurer
.
Quotes
Lissandra's
joke
"Is
it
cold
in
here,
or
is
it
just
me?"
is
similar
to
Brand's
joke
"Is
it
hot
in
here
or
is
it
just
me?!"
Lissandra
shares
a
quote
with
the
viking
;
"I
am
Iceborn."
One
of
Lissandra's
quotes
"Plans
within
plans"
is
a
phrase
that
is
frequently
used
in
the
science
fiction
series
Dune
Skins
The
bridge
seen
in
her
classic
skin
splash
art
is
the
same
bridge
in
Howling
Abyss
.
Bloodstone
Lissandra
shares
the
Bloodstone
theme
with
Bloodstone
Taric
.
Bloodstone
Lissandra's
splash
art
pose
is
the
same
as
the
pose
of
Elesh
Norn
from
Magic:
The
Gathering
card:
Marrow
Shards
.
Relations
Centuries
ago,
there
were
three
sisters:
Avarosa,
Serylda
and
Lissandra
.
They
lived
under
reign
of
The
Watchers
who
granted
them
power
and
immortality,
dubbing
them
Iceborn.
Avarosa
started
a
rebellion
against
The
Watchers,
and
Freljord
was
divided.
Lissandra
supplanted
her
own
successors
to
hide
her
immortality,
naming
her
final
heir
Lissandra
so
that
she
may
claim
her
own
name
back.
Ashe
descends
from
Avarosa
and
Sejuani
from
Serylda,
making
Lissandra
their
ancient
ancestor.
[8]
[9]
Anivia
and
Volibear
were
aware
of
the
presence
of
a
great
evil
in
Freljord.
This
great
evil
is
most
likely
The
Ice
Witch.
Anivia
was
made
aware
of
it
by
her
ties
with
Freljord's
magic.
She
felt
it
slowly
being
corrupted
and
turning
it
into
black
ice.
The
Ice
Witch's
magic
is
black
ice.
Volibear
was
made
aware
of
it
by
the
maelstrom's
vision.
He
saw
creatures
of
ice
slaughter
the
remaining
Ursines.
These
creatures
are
most
likely
the
Watchers.
Trundle
made
a
deal
with
The
Ice
Witch
after
he
tried
to
steal
her
enchanted
ice
club,
Boneshiver
.
In
exchange
for
it,
he
promised
her
a
troll
army,
once
he
overthrew
the
chieftains
of
each
troll
tribe
with
the
help
of
the
club.
According
to
Greyor
,
Lissandra
was
the
leader
of
the
Iceborn
before
the
rebellion,
making
the
Seeker's
Armguard
hers.
Sejuani
currently
owns
the
Seeker's
Armguard
although
it
is
unknown
how
she
got
hold
of
it.
Lissandra
first
met
Quinn
and
Valor
in
the
Frostguard
city.
Quinn
has
suspicions
about
Lissandra
if
she
is
really
an
ally
of
Ashe.
Valor
doesn't
like
Lissandra
,
maybe
because
Valor
can
feel
that
she
is
evil.
Lissandra
and
Quinn
later
crossed
paths
again,
but
this
time,
Lissandra
took
her
true
form
without
Quinn's
knowledge.
The
Hermit's
quote;
"You
want
to
be
queen
too?!
Too
many
queens..."
,
reveals
her
true
intentions.
Lissandra
could
be
the
one
who
imprisoned
Brand
,
as
hinted
in
the
Howling
Abyss
AMA.

Lissandra
&
Freljord
(music

lore)
(voice

"We
have
waited
so
long
for
this
day,
we
have
been
so
patient.
Now,
my
children,
my
Frostguard,
it
is
our
time.
"I
have
seen
the
future,
and
it
is
cold.
The
Watchers
return
and
they
are
so
pleased
with
you.
They
will
take
away
your
hunger.
They
will
take
away
your
pain.
You
will
be
reborn;
like
me,
you
will
become
Iceborn."
"We
will
take
back
what
is
ours.
The
other
tribes
won't
be
able
to
stop
us,
they
are
but
snowflakes.
And
we
are
an
avalanche."
